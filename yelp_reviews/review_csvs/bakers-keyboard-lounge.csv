We definitely will be back! Our waitress (I don't know her name) and the man who helped us were both phenomenal!"
5/4/2022,1 star rating,"I am so very disappointed with my $22.00 + 7.00 for this old dry dressing. I ordered smothered pork chops. The pork chops was old, brown inside, no gravy what so ever. I have no idea why they call it smothered.  I would have done better to order the fried with that being $2.00 less.The sweet potatoes were old and dry, as were the mac & cheese. This entire meal was old and re-heated in the microwave. It's terrible for this establishment to serve old food. I've eaten here many times before without any problem until now.Please quit re-heating old food, thinking customers wouldn't know the difference, we do. If you want return customers do better, because now I am afraid to order anymore food."
5/12/2021,4 star rating,"Got here for the first time the other night. Parking is $5 before 5 and $10 after. Cover is $15 per person and that can be added to the check. Tables are more spaced out and people have masks. Service was friendly and of course wonky during the musical break- but still got out and all settled. Wait staff pleasant and food - reminded me of southern comfort. I was too into my catfish, Mac and cheese and greens to take a pic. Bonus! Hot sauce at the table! How did they know? Had a great time and will definitely revisit this spot. Randy Armstrong onstage with his blue mashed potato blues- it's a great story don't want to spoil it for you!"
3/16/2022,1 star rating,"Me and my wife went to Baker's keyboard lounge to hear good music and eat some good food. once we got to the restaurant it took over an hour before a waitress came to our table to get our order, after that it took another hour before our food arrived. we attempted to talk to the owner who refused to come to our table, I know he was the owner and present because I went to high school with him. it is shameful that a restaurant with such a rich history has fallen to such depths. Also, the bathroom was filthy, there was water all over the floor, toilet paper and napkins all over the floor it was disgraceful. To add to this, the gratuity was added to the bill. I paid 18% to wait 21/2 hours for my food and beverage."

2/27/2021,3 star rating,This go around just had the smothered pork chops. And they was super tuff. I have put baker's keyboard lounge on my hit or miss list
2/27/2020,5 star rating,Good food great entertainment I had the fried liver and gizzards this time but the chicken and smothered pork chops are delicious the fish also greens were ok but the dressing was not inviting it could but much better. Drinks are good they do charge to park in the lot but there is free parking on the street. Wednesday is karaoke and you will not be disappointed.
8/29/2021,1 star rating,"We just had a very disappointing evening at Bakers Keyboard Lounge.  We were so excited to visit this historic place.   We came fro out of  town and have always known about the importance of this place.   We had reservations at 6:30 with the anticipation of hearing the ""house band."" At 7.  We had a wonderful young waiter, Earl who managed many tables.  At 7:00, we were surprised not to see a band setting up.  By 8:25, we walked out the door after eating dinner from an overworked staff with a promise of the band who was "" en route.""  The staff quoted the owner on this over and over again. My guess is that the owner knew a band would never show up and just needed to get paying customers in there.  How gravely disappointing for an historic landmark to be mismanaged in such a deliberate way."
9/2/2021,5 star rating,Great soul food. Best thing on the menu is the beef short ribs. I judge every soul food restaurant by there Mac and cheese and there's are decent. If u done in and are lucky enough to catch the live entertainment it's an experience you cnt miss.
9/17/2019,4 star rating,The food was great the entertainment was great the staff was great the atmosphere was great the appearance not so great I had an old menu that had water stains on it. The ladies bathroom ran out of paper towels I had told the female staff and an hour later there still was not enough attention given to it the bathrooms were really updated which I liked to a point they had new vessel sinks but everything else was normal I went to the manager pertaining to the paper towels are an hour later and that's when it was taken care of but everything else was great there was even a guest appearance from Paris France who enthralled us all Alan Dennard was the band that was playing live that night it was an awesome night I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Jazz they also have comedy nights and hip-hop and R&B night but there's still Jazz every night
1/13/2020,4 star rating,"My review of Bakers is more about my experience...I arrived at BKL as one set was ending and another commencing on a Sunday evening.The parking lot and alternate parking lot were just about full, cars lined both sides of Livernois as well.There is truly a great love for this establishment which has blessed Detroit with a great evening of jazz music, entertainment and delicious food since the 40s.I was able to secure a parking space and was assured that my $4 would be returned if there was no room inside.There is a $10 cover charge for the lounge area. You are allowed to sit at the bar free of charge.I opted for the bar, as I only stopped in for dinner on this evening. I have been here throughout my years in Detroit to take in the music, which really is always phenomenal.Back to the bar...The bar seats around ten. It's cramped quarters, but the patrons are so entertaining that I was happy to join them in conversation.The bar is fully stocked and there is a menu for special cocktails. I had a Billie Holiday. It was great, so great that I cannot remember what the ingredients are.The bartenders are fantastic and pour generously.For dinner I ordered turkey chops, cabbage and mac & cheese.My meal was delicious...I ate everything. A gentleman seated next to me commented that I was a dainty, but ferocious eater. Haha!I couldn't help but finish it all.I drank, and laughed and ate and had a fantastic time. I was there at least three hours. I even met a few acquaintances. We promised to see one another again."
2/15/2020,2 star rating,"We always have a great time here! Live music...top notch. Jackie the bartender always has a smile on her face and the drinks are always great! The guys at the front door make you feel welcomed, even the parking attendant is a nice guy! Tip:smothered pork chops and candied yams excellent. No wonder this place has been around for years.Update:  unfortunately things have changed...music still on point...however the ambience of ownership has gone down the toilet. The band had just finished the last song as we were putting on our coats we were told to ""get the f... out!""  It appears that the new investors don't respect the patrons that have been around for years..."

6/30/2021,4 star rating,Went on a Saturday evening & sat at the bar. Great service. I love their catfish. Aside from the ceiling leak near the end of the bar and flies flying around...I'd highly recommended.
8/7/2021,1 star rating,I've always wanted to come here so tonight a friend had a birthday party and I was so excited to go however this was by far the worst dining experience I have ever had. As I'm sitting here typing this review I have been here 2 hours and still don't have water or food. My husband received his food after 1 1/2 hours but he couldn't eat it because he still doesn't have silverware. I feel like I'm being punked at this point. The music is good the service is horrible the chicken was not seasoned at all and I couldn't tell you how the fish is because I still haven't received it.
8/7/2018,2 star rating,Ok... let me start off by saying i had this place bookmarked for the LONGEST and its right down the street from my parents house.  So why havent i been?  Unfortunately im glad i did take long because i wasnt impressed at all.  I had cousin coming from Texas and i wanted to show him a good low key spot; as well a little history to take back home.  This time i was unable to get to brag about the spot - everyone raved about the food being so good but why did it taste like nothing was seasoned at all.  I ordered 6 wings with two sides and macaroni and cheese and French fries because I was playing it safe all for $13; my cousin ordered 6 wings with two sides macaroni and cheese and dressing for $13 as well; my mom ordered meatloaf with two sides yams and collard greens but the price is unknown.  At least she was happy with her food but clearly I will highly suggest everyone to skip the wings and the macaroni and cheese.Another reason that put a bad taste in my mouth was the seating area - yes I understand the location is small inside but don't fit three grown and healthy adults at a small table fitted for two.  I asked the sitting person why couldn't we split up and he said the table we were sitting that could hold five people which okay if they weren't eating and or drinking then sure yes five people could sit but that wasn't the case for us.  Since I had to pay $10 for cover charge per person I feel that we could get a bigger table with no problem which we end up having to do but without backing down and putting up a fight basically.So let me at least ended on a positive note the music was good and the drinks were good that's pretty much it.  Parking is $3.Happy eating!!!
6/29/2019,3 star rating,This has been on my list to try. I placed an order over the phone. I ordered the 6 piece chicken dinner with mac and cheese and a side greens. The inside is very small. It made me feel uncomfortable. The greens were good without adding any hot sauce. The chicken was fresh but it did not have any seasoning. The mac and cheese didn't taste like much. The service i received was pretty fast.
4/17/2018,4 star rating,"Bakers is a classic Detroit jazz venue-- arguably THE classic Detroit venue- where a vibrant roster of bands and performers grace the stage more nights a week than not. It's a great, cozy place to go with friends or family, on a date, or, if you can swing it, with modest-sized groups.My first time in here was for a show that had to be cancelled at the last minute because of some sort of emergency with one of the performers. They profusely apologized to us (though we hadn't even known there was a show) and ended up producing a spectacular karaoke show-- like, people singing that I would actually pay money to see *in general*, let alone on an off night for karaoke. Every band I've seen is truly stellar!Pro tip: Avoid paying for parking and just park across the street. Or park across 8 Mile and walk. Sheesh!I subtract one star because the food and drink options aren't all fantastic and are generally pretty spendy. The Bakers Lemonade, a mainstay of the establishment, is not a bargain cocktail, but it's also really *the only cocktail you need all night, especially if you are operating a motor vehicle*. The food isn't anything to write home about and it's also pretty spendy, but it's still good."
2/17/2019,4 star rating,"Enjoyed a nice soul food dinner with my honey. I ordered the chicken wing dinner with Mac & Cheese and Collard Greens, my bf ordered the chicken wing dinner with Yams and Mac & Cheese and we ordered 3 addt'l sides - black eyed peas over rice, green beans and mashed potatoes and gravy. Pros: The food was good overall and was piping hot and tasted fresh. The Mac & Cheese, Yams and Collard Greens were TOP NOTCH!! The environment was nice and they played nice jazz music. There's live entertainment if you dine in on Saturday nights around 8pm, but you will have to pay a $15 cover fee. Cons: I don't think it's fair for customers dining in to pay a $15 cover fee - maybe more suited for the customers who only order drinks vs. dinner. Also, we were seated at a table of 8 with another couple because the smaller tables (with more comfortable seating) were reserved. By the time we left more than half of those tables were still empty, so I was a bit annoyed that we weren't seated there - would've def made our first experience better. The chicken seasonings were a little bland for our liking, but hot sauce did the trick. The black eyes peas over rice weren't seasoned well at all and the mashed potatoes and gravy were cold. Overall the food and experience was great, we will definitely give it another try the next time we're in Detroit."
8/11/2021,5 star rating,Had a wonderful time here! Great place to listen to Jazz and have a meal and drinks. Food was delicious. We will be returning.
7/30/2020,1 star rating,I went on my birthday. I love jazz and I wanted to have fun and enjoy a relaxing night with my family. We set reservation and the music was good but when it was time to order they ran out of food so only 2 in my party was able to eat. And we all payed full price to be there. To make us happy the owner tried to give my party free drinks which only me and my sister was drinkers so still a waste of money. Worse experience ever. I ended up eating Mc Donalds.
8/19/2020,1 star rating,"First, they were out of fries, then they were out of the alcohol I wanted and told me 30 mins later. They told us that they ran out of tilapia..40 mins after ordering it. You can tell the mashed potatoes were sitting for a while when they arrived. By this time we still didn't have our drinks...my drink ended up being fine, but my boyfriend's $5 coke was flat. We just heard this place was fantastic from so many people, so this was a huge let down. I'm very disappointed."
5/13/2018,3 star rating,"Came here for the first time with my husband and mother in law to celebrate mother's day. Sat down for an hour and  we were still waiting for the food (It did take them a long time to take our order). Happened to be the same time the band was taking a break so really nothing was going on. Not feeling much about the band and the singer at first. Not sure why, I have been to multiple jazz bars. It was around 6pm and all of a sudden a fight broke out. At first I thought it was just a louder conversation happening on the other side of the lounge, then my husband told me it was a fight. The band kept their cool and they turned up the volume. The situation got settled real quick. Ahh.....then they added the trumpet and the flute to the mix. That what missing. Food finally came after an hour and half after we sat down. My suggestion to anyone thinking about coming here is to give couple of hours before u anticipate to eat, otherwise you will be hungry for a while. Food was alright. My mother in law said her food was not hot and my catfish was too salty. My husband's baked chicken was the best. I love the collard green too. Overall, decent experience on the pricy side. I would come for the music again but may consider just ordering drinks."
3/15/2021,1 star rating,"Baker's Key Board Lounge is a Jazz Lounge in DETROIT and they choose to sale Food.  The owners or manager need to step up their game plan for selling food. The bad attitudes, the incompetency, the unprofessionalism that the manager and staff projects is one of the main reasons Black people have a problem patronizing black businesses are because of some of these reasons. After ordering over $150 worth of food in a timely manner, and when I go to pick it up, nobody knows anything about my order, they wanted me to reorder hell no to a reorder, I get no apology from management. The quality of food has gone down tremendously since juanita is longer there. I will never order food there again or patronize this place. It's 2021. Get it together or let someone who knows how to run a business run it. Get your attitudes right. Baker's was ran better than this 24 years ago. So disappointed."
5/17/2020,2 star rating,Wanted soul food. Remembered how surprisingly good this was many years ago and decided it couldnt hurt........  and i mean i guess it got the job done but overall was not good. I got a catfish dinner with cabbage and mac and cheese. $18. It included a piece of cornbread too. There was 2 pieces of fish which was okay tasted more like tilapia but what do i know. The sides were smaller portions. Cabbage had absolutely no seasoning i literally waited to get home (1 hr) to season it in order to eat. The mac and cheese had a sharp cheddar flavor and that was it. Definitely remembered it being amazing last time. No exaggeration. But no Wont be back. The cornbread was good though.
8/11/2015,4 star rating,"""The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!  Snap back to reality--oh, there goes gravity!"" EminemYup, I'm throwing it way back to 8 Mile!  It was driving to Bakers that I drove by THE notorious 8 Mile Road.   As made mainstream by Eminem, this road separates the rich from the poor.  Alas, my light bulb moment and my 8th grade self sighed, ""ah ha""...a decade after the movie was released...    Coincidentally, this was my road to transition from undergrad into grad school--I was in town for my University of Detroit, Mercy interview, and they were one of the first schools to admit me into the program.  Even though I am no Stan, I like to think that this road and this lounge does hold a special place in my heart (along with Marshall, just kidding!).My undergrad friend Jas and I drove to Bakers while Ed Stone was performing.  Bakers Keyboard Lounge carries with it a lot of history being the oldest jazz club in the USA, in the heart of Detroit.  This lounge is like the city in its decrepit way.  The outside--dark with worn down signs and its flickering lights; the inside--colorful yet dark, its main light source: candles.Food's a steal here and the entree portions will feed an entire family.  Food was GOOD SOUTHERN AWESOMENESS.  It was so soulful, it made us praise the Lord for we are unworthy to accept such grace.  hahaha, I kid, I kid.  Jas got the fried catfish dinner with potato salad and mac n cheese ($12.75), and I got the full rack BBQ rib dinner with fries and mac n cheese ($15).  Both entrees with sides were delicious and I could only fill up on 1/5th of my ribs before I KO'd.  My entree still looked whole...that's how GIGANTIC the portions were.  My deepest regret was not ordering the fried chicken...oh, I soooo should have.  I had a rib phase at the time, but how does one not order FRIED CHICKEN when going for soul food!?Service was subpar.  We got our food in and out quickly, but our waitress didn't want anything to do with us.  She didn't answer when asked for recommendations, she dropped off the check and stood there waiting for us to pay before she would leave.  When we got the hint, we paid with cash.  She immediately picked up the receipt and money, she counted it in front of us, and asked if the rest was for her.  Maybe it's a Detroit thing, but that was weird to us.Overall, I can't wait to come back next time I visit Motor City.  I highly recommend anything from the menu and to not come here expecting good service or a renovated establishment."
1/2/2018,4 star rating,"Oldie but goodie!This spot has been around literally Forever....and my recent visit reminded me of why.  Went with a group of 11 for lunch so there wasn't much of a crowd.  We were able to get a table right away.   On the lunch menu, the had quite a few options under $10 which was great.   Items ordered by our group included, fried pork chops , chicken wings, meatloaf, turkey and dressing, tilapia, and catfish.   Everyone was pleased with their meals.  There is not live music at lunch, but food was delish."
3/6/2020,2 star rating,Great music and entertainment but the staff needs some serious work! Rude! I was told over the phone they didn't have time to prepare what I wanted(smothered turkey chops) and that the cook said he was working with me to provide fried turkey chops with gravy on the side! I canceled the entire order. Never has a restaurant or other had to work with me! I am the customer ordering off your menu but ok me and my order went else where and so does my money.
1/19/2020,3 star rating,"Drove all over town looking for a soul food..My wife decided that we should go to Bakers. When entering it's a very tight squeeze.. The young lady at the coat check couldn't take my order because it was soo much traffic coming in. So I decided to go outside and call instead. After about 20 minutes I went in to retrieve my order and my total Was $50.00. Without thinking I paid and went outside. Something did not sit well so I went back in.. I ordered a meat loaf dinner w/ dressing and mac $15 with an add side of dressing. My wife  ordered a pork chop dinner w/ greens and yams $17. I was charged $18 for my meal, $4 for gravy on my meatloaf (which is included), $4 for an additional side of gravy, and $7 for the smallest container of dressing I've ever seen. And I didn't have my muffins.. Clearly I was rung up incorrectly. Another young lady spoke to the (manager?) who was standing acting like he was too busy to come and refund my money I was charged.. So she eventually went into a petty cash till and gave it to me cash. Now let's get to the FOOD.. Mac and Cheese contained no cheese.. $7 dressing was full of hair.. Meatloaf was tough and had too much ketchup on the top which I hate..  Greens were great. Wife said the pork chop was dry but greens and yams were good. Be careful when ordering carry out and the food is a definite hit or MISS..."
10/16/2017,4 star rating,"Good food paired with good music! Located on the southeast corner of Livernois and 8 Milesince the 1930s, the well lit sign makes Baker's easy to see. There is parking for a fee (we paid $5) in a fenced in adjacent parking lot manned with a few watchmen. First the environment- in one word, timeless. When you enter you are transformed to a past life as the live music engulfs your senses. Intimates booths with tables topped with candles and flower vases strategically surround the tiny stage so that all 99 seats have a great view. The venue setup makes the experience up close and personal. Although, this place is vintage it could use a few updates. Next the service - in one word, awesome. Waitstaff is prompt, efficient and friendly. Approached immediately with a cocktail menu (it lights up when you open it, making it easy to read in the dark) and took orders right away. Made note of and accommodated special requests and returned frequently to take away used dishes and check on us. Finally the food - in one word, delicious. The food was great. The menu had all of the traditional soul food favorites. I was trying to make healthy choices and selected the herb bakes chicken  (you get a half chicken), collard greens and yams. The hubby went straight for the fried catfish, fresh cut fries and a side of mac & cheese. We were both pleased to no end. So, if you are looking for down home food and down home music, then give Baker's a try."
4/21/2017,4 star rating,"Went early on Friday for dinner and music.Nice crowd, not too busy yet. Great happy hour trio. Funny and good selection of recognizable hits, from Marvin Gaye to The Beatles. Food was classic soul food. Husband got wings, pinto beans and yams. I had beef ribs, greens and mac and cheese. Highly seasoned. A lot of people like things with this level. I'm a low sodium kind of person, but still found it tasty.One complaint:  I didn't get my drink. I was probably taking too long to decide, but the server said she'd put our order and come back. Took awhile, so asked another person for a drink. Never came. When the server came back, it was with our food. Didn't want to confuse anyone, just in case it was on the way. Left before the 8pm show, and skipped $15 cover.Besides that, had a really nice time and even got to witness a surprise birthday party.  Recommended. We'll be back."
1/5/2017,4 star rating,"Was my parents favorite date night spot when we were kids during the 60s, leaving us home to watch Million Dollar Movie. I started frequenting when I cam of age during the 70s & have loved Baker's ever since.My parents relocated to Colorado, but moved back to Michigan in '89 & when my Mom died in '96, my Dad was a little lost, so I suggested a visit to Baker's for some pick-me-up jazz. They welcomed him like a long lost brother, and he & I were again hooked until he joined my Mom last year.My wife & I have dropped in, attended special events for various groups & CD releases. ALWAYS love the music, the ambience and the food. Always welcomed like family.A venerable Detroit institution on the Avenue of Fashion. Can't go wrong - check it out!"

They didn't have at least 4 sides (they ran out of, so they say ) they dressing had NO FLAVOR . The gravy was so salty it could kill a WHALE ! The greens has a crunch to them . The macaroni tasted like nothing but noodles & butter ! OMG .. their food has NEVER tasted like this before I'm very shocked and very disappointed in them ! Must be under new management or something"
11/10/2019,1 star rating,"I love to support local restaurants and especially in the city.  But there is NO WAY I would spend another dime in Baker's Keyboard Lounge. We sat at the bar then had a $150 carry out. At home while my children were eating one of my kids discovered a HOUSEFLY in his green beans.  I immediately tried to contact management, no return phone call, so when I called the next day I was treated by the owner as if HE was the one with a problem!!! Couldn't believe how rude and dismissive he was!!! After a few minutes of the Owner talking over me and trying to tell me there was no flies in their food, he said he would refund me the full amount - that he would send a check in the mail and HE LIED AND NEVER DID. My next course of action will be to contact the HEALTH DEPARTMENT about this establishment serving food CONTAINING INSECTS and their HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. IF YOU DONT LIKE TO EAT HOUSE FLIES THEN STAY AWAY FROM BAKERS."
5/19/2019,5 star rating,"The Best dining experience ever!!!Family of 7 - Started of with cocktails and appetizers (wing dings and catfish nuggets). The drinks were on point and so were the catfish nuggets. Our server was Gina - who was so attentive!! The Fam ordered a variety of dishes from Turkey chops to Smothered Chop to T-Bone Steak to BBQ Ribs. I ordered Short Ribs with Pinto Beans and Potato Salad which was absolutely delicious . The Jazz music  playing in the background was amazing. Please support the oldest Jazz club in Detroit, Michigan.... I promise you won't be disappointed. Thanks to the ownership keep providing great food and customer service."
8/6/2016,4 star rating,"Historical jazz lounge restaurant in Detroit? Count me all the way in! My dad recently celebrated his birthday and decided to come here for dinner. I lived in Detroit for 18 years and spent a lot of time on Livernois, but somehow this was my first visit here. Shoutout to you Dad for always making me hip to the game. Let's get into what that experience was like in true Marniqua fashion- you got it! With a list. 1. The restaurant. The location is easy to find and hard to miss. As soon as you approach the door, you can almost feel yourself time traveling back into the Harlem Renaissance era. The keyboard bar is sick. The dining area is rather small and fills up quick so get here as early as possible, especially if a popular band is playing. 2. The band. Safe to say I am now apart of the bandwagon. I think they do an excellent job of booking experienced bands to keep the vibes going all night. 3. The food. I was that girl who didn't order anything but dessert and picked off everyone else's plate. Everything I was able to get a bite of was delicious. My brownie a la mode was perfection. Soft warm brownie, healthy scoop of vanilla ice cream, topped with a ton of whipped cream! Yummmmmm all my faves. Mac n cheese was seasoned well and had just the right amount of cheese. Greens were good and so were the black eyed peas. Fried chicken and perch will have to speak for themselves, but I'm not sure if it's really possible for this kinda restaurant to mess those up. 4. The service was meh. They were short staffed so there was some wait time. But our waitress was really sweet and went the extra mile to try to get things done."
12/6/2019,1 star rating,"Terrible service, been waiting 20 mins for a drink and was informed the bartender doesn't care. Prolly gonna walk out, go ANYWHERE ELSE! This was my first and def last time ever coming in here. The two white folks in here were served expetiouslu though, FUCK this place!!!"
12/28/2019,3 star rating,"Music was fantastic, although this is obviously going to vary by performance. If you are coming for the music then this is a great spot, however I would recommend you dine elsewhere. The food was in one word, abysmal. All of our dishes were poorly seasoned, did not taste fresh and lacking in flavor overall. We ordered Chicken, Mac & Cheese and Peach cobbler.  The service was outstanding, our waiter was extremely personable. Bathrooms were not clean, menus were not clean and the whole place looked a little run down. This is a historic spot after-all, however cleanliness is effort based.Maybe the chef was having a bad night, however, in speaking with some of the other patrons they reported the quality of the food has recently taken a dive. This is truly a shame because the musical performance was wonderful.Bottom line, great music, bad food. I would happily come here again for the music, stick with drinks and eat dinner elsewhere."
10/14/2017,4 star rating,"I have been here before but I decided to take my in laws here for a birthday celebration. I called to reserve a table and I was told that it would cost $15 per person to reserve. That is $150 non refundable dollars. No thank you. My sister called later and they said they would attempt to retain it. All parking is valet around the building. The cost is $10 per person to enter the lounge after a certain time. This has always been interesting as you usually get food and drinks when you come here. The place is intimate and small. Every seat is near the stage so no place is a bad place unless you are seated at the bar.  There is usually a different jazz band here regularly. This night there was local entertainment. The music did sound great as usual.  I ordered smothered pork chops with fries with gravy. The food was plentiful and outstanding. A few people ordered gizzards and liver. I tried some due to the fact I did not remember the last time I had these. They were fried and delicious. The cost can be a little steep with 2 dinners, one dessert and a drink it was $75 plus add on the entrance charge. There is always a diverse crowd which is always good to see. Overall, it is one of the great places to listen to jazz and enjoy good food. I do plan on visiting again sometime in the future."
2/4/2018,5 star rating,"TOP 3 THINGS I liked here: corn muffin, jazz, and the service.Be careful what you order here because they come in gigantic portions. And they're all so tasty! My friend and I got a variety of things: short ribs, BBQ ribs, and fried catfish. None of us was disappointed as we shoved everything in front of us down our throats. The servers here are the epitome of Detroit hospitality. They are down to earth, genuine, efficient, and funny. I would recommend this place to locals and tourists alike."

We prefer the 313 Experience( band ) and DJ Fingers on Tue.nights There's always a diverse crowd of mature Whites, Asians, Blacks young and older. We've eaten everything on their menu, Ribs, Catfish, Wings, Yams, Mac n Cheese, Greens, Stuffing and other food items. We also love their drinks, !  Peña Coladas my favorite ! A Combination of their food, music and their awesome wait staff is what keeps us going back. My wife and never see the bartenders and cooks but we feel the same LOVE from them as we do our visible waiters and hostesses. LOVE IT !"

I'm pretty sure her name was Love.We both ordered dinners. Price was definitely worth the quality and portion.The bad...tables for 2 are really tiny. Unless you are 2 smaller people, not particularly comfortable and quite a feat to fit dinner plates and drink glasses on the table.Not particularly a warm welcome. We stood for a few minutes while people looked at us and said nothing. Finally, someone asked if we needed help. Not sure what that was all about.Went on their website to check out the calendar of events. Nothing there. Zero events. Left an email asking if they were open or closed. No response. Called at 1030 am and the phone just rang and rang. No recording with information, time open, the act for the night...nothing. called back at 3 and a young lady gave me information and the cover cost ($10).And The Ugly...arrived and was asked to give $20 per person. I questioned the amount and mentioned what I was told on the phone. Doesn't matter, it's $20 per person. The confusion continued as we tried to pay. I also mentioned that we were friends of one of the band members. The price then changed as did the attitude. Complete 180. Bothered me that had we not have known a band member we would have paid more than quoted.Suggestion to management...post accurate, updated information on your website. Provide people answering the phone with the right information as to avoid the feeling that we we may be scammed.It's a shame that I felt compelled to write about this part of the experience. Wanted to make everyone aware."

1/16/2016,5 star rating,This a your 5 star option if awesome jazz music and comfortable American food is what you're looking for. Started coming back here over the last several months and we have not been disappointed. The B. Williams Experiment was utterly entertaining on our last visit and it's hard to understand why people aren't lined up at the door for this venue. This establishment is the longest continuously running jazz club in the country. You really need to add it to your must see lists. Some of the greatest Jazz players have graced this stage over the years and it is so nice to see this place continuing in that tradition. The food is good and plentiful. You can add some soul food sides to your order and if you know to ask they will even blacken your catfish. The drinks are well poured and if they added a craft cocktail and local brew menu that could excel even more. We will keep this as a go to place for great music and an overall great experience.

I'm a creature of habit. I love my catfish! Was very tasty although my greens weren't the vinegary kind and had me in the mindset of is this spinach‍. Nice large portion on the catfish! My drink was stiff & not for the weak at heart lol! I have an event schedule and will definitely be back for a table & live entertainment!"
10/18/2017,2 star rating,"I have enjoyed Baker's in the past, however I hadn't been in years and boy was there a difference. We went this past Monday for ""Free"" Comedy night but let me tell you, free is not always free which was the case here. First of all we had to wait on ""Bill"" to arrive for the doors to be opened, which means they opened a few minutes late. Second, the smell of the place was not pleasant, there was a mixture of bleach and funk. Third, there was an abundance of fruit flies. We found ourselves swatting them all night.  Fourth, the food and drinks are ridiculously priced! It was two of us and the bill was $128, for some mediocre food and over priced drinks.  We ordered 1800 Silver with roses lime and was charged $13 for each drink and then an extra $2 for the Roses Lime, which we asked for a splash of.  Roses Lime is like cranberry juice to a drink so why should we have had to pay extra for it??? $2 at that, making each drink $15.  It was listed on the receipt as premium, what's premium about lime juice? I'm not cheap but I can't stand being taken advantage of and that's what happened! Don't have a free night and then try to overcharge on everything else. I've decided that I won't be back, that just don't sit well with me!  The comedy was cool but all night the comedian asked people to put money in a jar for them, my response was hell tell the management of Bakers to pay you some of that money they have extorted from us patrons tonight. Oh one more thing, I forgot to mention our waitress was cool but charging an automatic 18% gratuity on a party of two is also ridiculous. They got me this time but it won't happen again!"
9/12/2013,4 star rating,"Detroit has been in the eye of the nation lately and like many I was interested in visiting it for myself. I also had friends who recently moved there. Detroit has a rich history and a epic decline but yet still holding on the its bootstraps and hang on.It is also a city not particularly tourist friendly. It is unpredictable. You can't really explore the streets like some other cities. You need a car. You need a local to guide you on some hidden gems and neighborhoods.On our visit Baker's seemed appropriate. Claims to be the oldest jazz club it might epitomizes Detroit's heritage. It is a bit interesting that on the night we went there was also a $5 cover charge considering one would also go eat there. The dishes here don't disappoint in flavor and portions. The Fried chicken was delicious. Crispy and moist. The two sides of mac & cheese and collard greens were equally a delight. The smothered Pork Chops was a plate full of goodness as was the beef short ribs.  You can probably share the dishes as it could feed for two but you might want to keep the fried chicken to yourself. We wanted to try the peach cobbler but I don't think there was any more room in my stomach.Beyond the food is the ambiance and music. It is a laid back, friendly establishment and the live music only adds to the dining experience.  If you are on a diet, health conscious or a vegan don't even bother. Bring on the elastic waist band because you'll need it after enjoying a meal at Baker's or don't eat for the next 2 days."

8/9/2015,4 star rating,"I've been a child of this place. My Mom and Dad came here a lot in my youth and when I was old enough they brought me here, (after their divorce) because this place is that timeless. As a jazz baby, I welcome live instrumentalist while I dine. The stage is in your face. The size is definitely something they need to review. It's time for change. They do need a larger, more secure parking lot and they do need a larger more comfortable venue. Maybe a remodel needs to be considered. It's like being in the Jazz basement Zora Neal Hurston speaks of in How It Feels to Be Colored Me. It has the ambiance, the culture, the feel, the music but as a comfortable and welcoming place to dine and cater to the future it needs to rethink and realign some things. The cover for the night, Friday, was $10 each. I understand that the band and the house needs their money but I'm also dining and buying drinks in a cramped, unconditioned place so a cover is kind of a slap in the face. If you're going to charge me for everything make it worth my while. Once I sat, next to the kitchen door, I was drawn to the music and the eclecticism of the crowd. The experience is one of a kind.They were busy and seemed a bit unorganized on waiters and tables but we were attended to with grace. The house drink was strong and worth it. We only needed one and my guest and I felt we should have shared it. Delicious and refreshing. The wait for our meal was no more than 30 mins which is reasonable for the crowd and type of food. I ordered fried chicken, greens and sweet potatoes, my friend ordered fried fish, cabbage and beans. We were not let down. The wait, the cramped feeling and the door fee was forgiven.I'll be back with some reservations."
10/29/2015,4 star rating,"What an atmosphere! Came here on a lateSaturday night with my bf after seeing La Boheme at the Opera House. Its small size makes it cozy, warm (a bit too warm actually- don't wear thick layers here) and intimate. It was clear that everyone  was having a great time, laughing raucously and going back and forth with the singers. The musicians were bomb! It was Sweetest Day so the audience was serenaded all night with jazzy old school love songs. We ordered food, of course. My fried chicken craving was taken care of that night.  Our ribs were so tender and juicy, too. The sides were alright. My BF thought they tasted canned but I still ate all my mac n cheese, yams, and greens. The kitchen ran out of quite a few of the dishes/sides we tried to order at first, but I'll chalk that up to our late arrival. I agree with whoever said this is a good date spot if you want to be ""forced"" to get closer to your date-Baker's is the place for that. Baker's has a paid parking lot but it was full so we chose to park on the street and walked 5 min."

12/10/2016,1 star rating,I try to support black establishments. But this place is ridiculous!  I'm came all the way from Chicago to a Bears vs Lions games with over 20 guests. So we decided to go Bakers . Well the owner or manager came from the back and said NO  they can't stay for the jazz session to one of his waitresses . Loud enough so we can all hear him. It's five o'clock and the live jazz starts at 8:00pm. He wanted us out by 7:45pm because it's a $20 cover charge at 8pm. Mind you it's 25 people with a 2 drink minimum plus the food is expensive. The dumb management was only worried about that initial cover charge at 8pm. He would've made at least 1000 in 30 minutes just by us ordering drinks alone. He missed out one a HUGE SUM of MONEY! He was very disrespectful! He made the worst business decision ever!!
10/15/2016,2 star rating,"Yesterday, my family and my mother's friends celebrated my mother's 70th birthday party at Baker's Keyboard Lounge. The entertainment was great! Michael Brock was so good! As well, one floor manager, Donte was great! But, the manager and co-owner pulled a bate & switch move on us. When we booked the venue, the general manager was nice an accommodating. He and the owner advised us on our order. We were treated nice by the owner who wrote the order. He said you would have enough food. He even deducted the tax to save us money and said he wanted to help us have a nice event. Yet, on the date of the party, he was no where to be found and then the bate and switch. Thus, I am taking to Yelp to tell people to boycott Baker's. They failed to honor our catering agreement or confirm our agreement with the other owner. They did a bate & switch move and said we didn't order enough food to feed our 20-22 guest. They said that we had to pay them more money to get what we paid for--an order we made under the advice of the other co-owner. Since we refused to pay more money, they served my mother's guest a kiddy plate--2 wing, 4 catfish nuggets the size of a quarter, and 2 tablespoons of sides.  I should've taken and posted a photo to show you how ridiculous that plate looked. After I got over my anger, I did the math and noted that they could have told us to order a regular meal from their menu @$13 per person--the price of a full chicken meal (with 6 wings, two saucers/bowls of sides, & a corn muffin), which is only $6 more than what we paid for when we were told to order the half of pans of food for 22 people (minus ONE side). I can't stop crying about this incident. Long story short, I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT in Bakers Keyboard Lounge again. Also, under the current ownership, most of my mother's 20 guest and their friends probably will never see the inside of Baker's again. I ask you to join me in my boycott of Baker's Keyboard Lounge."
1/22/2015,2 star rating,"Update:Came back to dine here for some good southern comfort fare. There was a $5 cover to see the jazz band, no biggie.  I came with 2 coworkers. Waitress asked us of we wanted top shelf or bottom shelf tequila (of course we picked top shelf since tequila give you a headache of a hangover). We asked the waitress for price, no answer, and she went on her merry way to type in our order in the POS. We ordered the 2 entree with 4 sides plus a pitcher of margarita. Food is excellent as always but when we got the bill for the margaritas we were charged for $55.00 for a pitcher of margarita. This is so unheard of $55.00. I complained so they discounted us $10.00 off the bill so if you do the math we were charged $45.00 for a pitcher of margarita. Never again. Order food but don't order drinks. They don't even have a drink menu because they will charge you accordingly. Never again. Food is still good."
1/22/2014,5 star rating,"Came here with 10 other people while in town for The Detroit Auto Show. While on the road there's not many great places to eat aside from overpriced hotel restaurants usually located in the lobby. So I was ecstatic to come here with my coworkers. The owner was great and so hospitable. He greeted us and thanked us for coming to the restaurant. ""Hope you folks have a nice time. We'll have to hook you up with some pitchers and we'll have to get pictures later."" My company and I looked at each other confused, did he say pictures or pitchers hoping it was an alcoholic pitcher of some sort. Minutes later we were brought out a pitcher of margarita. He did not disappoint!I am a fried chicken connoisseur ordering fried chicken at least 3x a week for the past few months after discovering Krispy Krunchy Chicken in a gas station in Chicago. If I thought Krispy Krunchy was good my taste buds we're in helluva ride that night at Bakers.I ordered the Fried Chicken with collard greens and yams. The Fried Chicken was phenomenal as reviewed by previous yelpers. I don't know what type of seasoning they use or the recipe for the breading but it was crunchy, moist, tender, mouth watering. The atmosphere was lively, the drinks hard, the music was bumpin', and people of Baker's all tied neatly to the jazz club experience. 5 star!"

If you are hungry or looking for good or even decent service when it comes to dining, this definitely is NOT the place for you. The kitchen looks very unkempt, they have updated the dining area a little bit. I had 5pm reservations at 6:25 still no food, my glass from my drink was dirty, visibly dirty. The music is always great though. Bakers is like that good longtime friend you visit because you've known each other forever but you always eat before you go over because u know their house is nasty!!"

They played adult contemporary R&B as well as a few modern jazz tunes flawlessly. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. The mac and cheese and potato salad were some of the best I've ever had. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."
7/16/2017,5 star rating,"We must have come on a good night, because I'm confused about the posts that say the service lacks. I had an amazing waiter and so did the tables surrounding us. From the very minute we walked in we were warmly welcomed and seated. Our waiter came over almost immediately to give us menus and take our drink order. The drinks came quick. We had 2 more in our party that came about 30 mins after we got there, and they were quickly attended to. We ordered our food and it came quickly also. Wow! Food was delicious! I'd go back just for the food! I got the fried chicken wings, and it came with 2 sides. I got collard greens and dressing with gravy. The crispy skin was delicious! The sides I devoured. My daughter and her boyfriend both got the catfish with greens and mac n cheese. They were both very happy with their order. (Although, they ended up giving their leftovers to a homeless guy that hit us up for leftovers while we were leaving, they gave it with reluctance because the food was so good!) lol! My husband got the meatloaf, he said it was ""ok"". But he's mr. Picky pants.The band was awesome, even let my daughters boyfriend get on stage and jam with them. He's a rapper so I was surprised about letting him rap at a jazz bar but it was good and everyone seemed to enjoy it!The downside: There is a 2 drink minimum per person and a $15 per person cover charge, and $5 parking. So it costed my husband and I $35 before we sat down. We were a party of 4, and they sat us at a table for 6. Later, they sat 2 more patrons at our table. Kind of confusing at first, but it ended up being fine though, were all just there to enjoy the food, drinks and the music. They were nice gentlemen too so it worked. Long story short:Great food, great service, great music and a TON of history! I'd come again for sure!"

1/8/2010,5 star rating,"Yes it IS the oldest Jazz club in the world- and you can feel it when you're there. My first time to Bakers was a night I will never forget. This Singer named Renee Jackson (where ever did she go?!) was one of the most brilliant entertainers. She kept us all laughing and engaged the whole night. She took the time to interact with the crowd and really make us all feel at home and a part of it. And then, she opened her mouth to sing and I could have sworn she was some hybrid of Aretha Franklin and Etta James. I was in Jazz heaven. Her band was really something too. Stand up bass, drums and a man on the piano that got into it like he was Stevie Wonder. Just phenomenal!!! If I could relive that night I would. In addition, the fried chicken, collard greens and mac n' cheese are really delicious. Maybe not the best in Detroit, but certainly what you'd expect of some good soul food. They don't skimp on the portions and every table is armed with hot sauce. Places like this aren't just a cool feature in Detroit they ARE what makes this city."

I decided to take the opportunity to stop by and check it out.  I do suggest that you be aware of your surroundings. The Baker's Keyboard Lounge is not just well lite outside, the bar/restaurant is very small and during peak times feels very crowded.  The building could use some remodeling. The biggest downer was the time it took for the kitchen to get the food out. It is no joke when I tell you that it took a little over 2 hours to get my food. I was not the only one.  I kept hearing the waitress apologize for the slow kitchen."
8/28/2010,5 star rating,"Ah, my 200th review. My 100th was a memorable one (Graydon's Crossing in Grand Rapids), and so is this one. Just went to Baker's on a Friday night to get the real feel for Baker's (my previous review was from a Sunday afternoon when they were empty).I was blown away. The food was just as good as last time. I got the fried chicken dinner with mac & cheese and collard greens. It was all so fresh, crisp, and TASTY. I mean the chicken was plentiful and fried to perfection. Breaded so nicely and not overdone. Hot, steaming and juicy on the inside, and crisp and dry to the touch on the outside. The mac and collard greens were superb! It is great to know the food comes out awesome, even when they are super busy.The restaurant was very busy Friday night around 10pm, and understandably there was a $5 cover per person (which is very fair considering the live jazz-soul is so melodious and mood-setting). The place packed with folks while Motown jazz soul music sound waves were bouncing all around in here. No wonder this place was so empty at 1:30pm before, because it is truly an out of the world experience at night, especially on weekend nights. You really feel like you are transported back to the days of a glorious Detroit. Motown music and great soulfood truly live on in this place. I was a little let down that the same fried chicken meal was a couple bucks more at night, than in the afternoon - but honestly the vibe in here and the crowd more than make up for it. Yes it's in Detroit - but if you park on the street nearby and just be generally cautious - you will be fine.Excellent place! The culinary gem of Motown. Great food, great music, great crowd, and memorable historic restaurant. Just be aware of steep pricing on drinks and possible cover charges when it's busy. This place is billed as the world's oldest jazz club (at 76 years old). It lives up to its name - big time."
6/8/2010,5 star rating,"I went here with some friends on a June Sunday afternoon at 2PM. The restaurant was near empty and it was evident that this place gets the live entertainment and most of its clientèle in the evening hours, typically beginning 7PM. The establishment itself is in a cozy nook towards the near-West side of 8 Mile. It is a dark, cozy, and storied establishment. The worn out grand piano in the dining area stage looks very archaic and one can only imagine the Motown greats and local favorites that have played and performed here in the past several decades.Though we came at a time when it had just opened up, it was still such a pleasant experience. The wait staff was very on point and friendly. The soul-food here was plain and simply, AWESOME. My catfish fillets were crispy cornbread crumb fried on the outside, and flaky tender without being overly greasy on the inside! Both fillets were oversized and filling, though the quantity was expectedly less than in the fried or baked chicken meals. My 2 selected sides of collard greens and mac & cheese were VERY tasty, no complaints whatsoever. My girlfriend's fried chicken dinner was marvelous. Fried to perfection, big meaty pieces of big boneded chicken, not overly greasy, and tender meat on the inside - served piping hot. The house made sweet and tangy BBQ sauce we got to dip the food in was to die for! It really aroused the taste buds, went excellent with the soul-food to dip in, and made one wonder just how the chef of the day conjures such a wonderful sauce with intricate spices and homemade consistency!Overall, I left this place with one of the biggest smiles on my face. This is a diamond in the rough, a true Detroit gem. This is a historic Motown classic that has changed only enough to meet modern health codes and building codes - everything else about it is historic and pre-riot Detroit! Admittedly, I went during the lunch hours where the lack of live entertainment and earlier hours in the day leave the restaurant virtually empty, I can only imagine how lively and busy it gets in the evening hours during later suppers! The bar has a great selection of drinks, and makes drinks strong - though admittedly the prices are on the steep side for Detroit (approx $7-$10 for a cocktail). The food prices on the other hand were VERY fair at around $9-$13 for most hearty meals on the simple menu! There is a novelty shop with T-shirts and the like as well. My Floridian friend purchased one.I highly recommend dinner here! Go in the afternoon for a quiet and awesome meal, and go after 7PM for a lively jazzy culinary experience! Call ahead in the evenings to make sure the live act does not have a cover charge, as bigger events sometimes do."

If I could give them ZERO stars I would, worse experience I have ever had dealing with a business, this was like someone's ghetto basement party.  No class!"

3/26/2014,5 star rating,"I love Baker's.  Always have.I have been running senior outings and thought it might be nice to take them to Baker's, as they have told me they all used to hang out there back in the day.Tuesday afternoons (noon - 3pm), Bakers has lunchtime entertainment.  This happens to be perfect for a senior group.  They also have a great lunch special (cheap is REALLY good for seniors - and hell, anyone), it is only $8 for pork chop or whiting or turkey or wings + 2 sides.  Nice special!  I wasnt expecting much (but truthfully, my seniors don't eat a ton).  The portions were moderate, but absolutley perfect.  Side note, several asked abt preparation and I didn't know.....but I do now....Fried pork chop - deliciousWhiting - breaded, fried catfish (?) - everyone loved itTurkey - shredded with light chicken gravy (if desired) - yummyWings - people loved em.Some of the sides that were big hits:  mac & cheese, side salad (very generous portion), greens, mashed and baked potatoes,Dessert (not included in $8 price):  Brownie is delicious, but I especially LOVE the Peach Cobbler.  (Downside, if they sell out over the weekend, they don't always have Peach Cobbler on Tuesday).I don't drink coffee, but one of our guests said they thought it was instant.  That was the closest thing to a complaint I heard.Now to give you fair warning, they have one cook and a small kitchen. They did take 5 orders in at a time (and brought 5 orders out at a time).  To get thru 35 people took quite a long time, but honestly they were really patient (kudos to our group!), and I am sure the entertainment was a great diversion.  I considered dropping down to 4 stars because of the wait, but truthfully, for what they are doing - they do it very very well!Now on a side note, I get carry out at lunch time and it is pretty quick and SO YUMMY (I LOVE the meatloaf and of course the Peach Cobbler).  On my original review, I suggested BAKER'S as a great first date place, but I'd like to also suggest it would make an IDEAL place to take your parents."

I let them know that I'm coming from West Bloomfield and I don't have time to come back. So they made it so that I won't be back not even to dine in. Thanks BAKERS!
10/12/2018,1 star rating,"MICE!! Went to celebrate my mother's 70th birthday I arrived at 3:59 reservation was at 4. The worker looked where our table was supposed to be and said you have arrived early the other party is still here...early its one minute until but OK no problem. The rest of my party was running late so no biggie. Then we were  greeted with several mice running on the floor. The lady on the keyboard asked in the mic are you guys OK becuz we are screaming feet in chairs etc. she asked that management come to our area. The manager comes over he says what's the problem we say there are mice over here. He states ""one moment let me get the broom"" all calm like its the norm. Then he attempts to grab one with his hand. Nastiness at its best, I will be calling the Health dept first thing!!! Selecting one star becuz it made me but no stars from me"
10/16/2010,4 star rating,"I heard several rumors about Bakers closing due to our poor economy.    I would like to personally hug whoever is responsible for stopping that.From the minute I saw the huge sign outside, I knew this place was going to be cool.   This is exactly what a jazz club should look like.   Dimly lit, crowded, and littered with tiny tables and booths to accommodate cuddly couples out for the night.The hubs and I met some friends there last night and I started with a Captain and Diet.   I was warned that their drinks are strong but holy cow!!!   You definitely get your moneys worth here.   Hubs was driving so it was Miller Light for him. Boring.The music started and I was instantly carried back in time to a day that I wish still existed.   They were singing 'Unforgettable'   and as I was looking around at all of the photos of jazz greats on the wall, I imaged that every single person had probably played there.   Totally awesome.The night got even better as I saw couples stand up and dance from time to time.   Those are moments I find endearing and Bakers created such a perfect environment that I was tempted to stand up and sway myself.It was only $5 to get in which is a steal considering going to a bad Hollywood movie is twice that.    I didn't order any food but I kept seeing it and smelling it pass by.   Reading the previous reviews, it seems as if the fried chicken, mac'n cheese and collard greens are the way to go.   Therefore I will be headed back there to give it a shot and say with confidence the star rating will boost up to 5."
2/21/2016,2 star rating,"The only reason why I'm giving Baker's 2 stars at this point is because it's Baker's and they are a legend in the Detroit area.  Otherwise I would demote them to a 1 star. Husband and I visited there last night and was very disappointed in how this place has went down.  Paid 10$ cover charge each.  Man at the door collected the money and that was it.  He didn't bother to get off his behind and escort us to a seat, or assist us in finding a seat; he just took the money and continued his conversation with the person he was playing on his phone with when we walked in.  We found seating at the bar near the mirror where as when we approached the bar stools there was something gross laying on the floor next to one of the chairs.  Which I still can't get out of my mind.  After that I was totally ready to go but because our 20$ was in the door we decided to tough it out, stay and order drinks.  It took poor old Ms.Jackie almost 30 minutes to stroll over to us and take our drink order as she was more concerned and attentive to orders coming in from the dining area.  We placed our drink order and was told if we wanted to order food we needed to order right then because the kitchen was closing at 11pm.  We arrived at 10:15pm.  This woman had no will, drive, or motivation to move fast at all.  She looked as if she absolutely hated her job and did not want to be there.  Never once did I see her wipe down the bar counter after people left.  She would just remove the dirty glasses and that was it.  Poor sanitation at its finest!!!Food was nothing like it use to be.  The pork chops were barely seasoned, greens were bland, and the yams had way to much cinnamon.  The corn bread muffin and mac & cheese were good just like we remembered.The ladies bathroom surprisingly so was clean and well maintained.  I was shocked as I went in there prepared to see what I saw on the floor in the bar area.  But it was clean.  I was just disturbed after I washed my hands and there was no paper towel to dry them so of course I had to use toilet paper to dry my hands and use to reopen the door.Unfortunately, I want be going back to Baker's.  I heard they are relocating to a new location in the downtown Detroit area.  If this is true perhaps this is why they are not investing any money into this particular establishment.  Hopefully when they move things will be much better and the workers will be more professional."

1/16/2016,1 star rating,"It pains me to have to write this review, considering that Bakers Keyboard Lounge has been a favorite of my family's in the past.  Additionally, I've never written a bad review because I take my reviews and the impact that reviews can have on a business very seriously.  However, what happened last night was incredibly disappointing, so much so that my family will never go back to Bakers, and I feel like it's my duty to warn future potential customers of the perils of what may happen if you choose to dine at Bakers.As I said before, my family and I have gone to Bakers in the past, but only for drinks, and we've had a great time.  We couldn't wait to try dinner.  Little did we know it would be the worst dining experience of our lives...After paying $5 for parking and $10 each for cover, we were seated for our 8 o clock reservation.  It wasn't until about 9:45! that we were finally served our food.  It took an incredibly long time to get each drink, and by the time we got our food, we were starving.  My mom and brother ordered a T-bone steak (each medium rare).  My boyfriend ordered fried chicken, and I ordered fried catfish.Let me start by pointing out that my meal never came.  My mom, brother, and boyfriend were served, and we were told that the catfish would come.  About 15 minutes passed before the server returned to our table, and my meal was not with her.  In the meantime, my mom and brother attempted to cut into their steaks only to see that they were way cooked way past medium rare, all the way to well done.  Let me point out that I, along with my family, RARELY, if EVER, send food back.  I have eaten MANY incorrect or cold orders, simply because I prefer not to make someone's life harder by sending food back or making complaints.  Only if the food is basically inedible do we ever say anything.  That being said, the steak was basically inedible.  It was cooked all the way through, was an off-grey color, and was incredibly tough, and it cost $22 a piece.  So when the server finally returned with waters (but not with my food) they very politely pointed out that they ordered their steaks medium rare and asked if they could have steaks as they ordered them.  The server agreed that the steak wasn't cooked right and took it away.About 10 minutes later (let me remind you, I'm still sitting there with no food, and my boyfriend is waiting to eat his until everyone is served...), instead of getting new steaks, we were approached by a very defensive and rude cook. The cook emerged from the kitchen holding the two plates, the server trailing him looking very uncomfortable.  The visibly angry cook proceeded to slam the steaks back on the table in front of my mom and brother, and go on a rant, telling us that the steaks he cooked WERE in fact medium rare, and that we were wrong for requesting new ones.  I asked him to look at the steak and explain how it could be mistaken for anything but incredibly well done.  He went on to argue with me, saying that ""If a steak has juice coming out of it, it's medium rare...""  the juice he spoke of was the  small pool of brown grease that the steak sat in.... he proceeded to rant about how long he's been cooking and how he knows what medium rare is, and if we want another steak he is going to serve it to us ""BLOODY"" if that's what we want.  Looking back, I wish I would have taken a picture of it, because I literally could not BELIEVE what was happening.  The steak was undeniably well done, and even if it wasn't, when does a cook ever come out of the kitchen and yell at a customer in front of the entire restaurant?!  I've worked in the restaurant business for years, and this NEVER would have been acceptable in any of the establishments I've been in employed in.  If a customer has a request, unless it's totally unreasonable, you satisfy that request, no matter how annoyed it may make you.  And in this case, we made the most reasonable request in the most polite of ways.  Moving on.  My mom and brother decided that they had lost their appetites and we needed to go elsewhere.  I asked the server to speak with a manager.  The manager was very nice.  She agreed with us that what the cook did was unacceptable.  She didn't make us pay for the steaks, however, we WERE charged for the catfish (which we never got) and the fried chicken (which we didn't eat).  By the time we realized that we were charged for a meal we had never gotten, we were so exhausted and embarrassed by the incident that we just wanted to GET OUT.  And GET OUT we did.The disappointment I feel from this experience is hard to put into words. We spent a LOT of money on parking, the covers, and the food we never got, and left feeling insulted, appalled, and hungry.  Needless to say, we will never go back.  Additionally, we will tell anyone we know never to go, or go back.  And I advise you never to go, either.  Sorry, Bakers Keyboard Lounge, but you provided us with the worst dining experience of our lives."
2/29/2016,3 star rating,"I can completely understand why some people put up low star reviews, because they are trying to compare this place to some restaurant or some tourist trap. For anyone that rates Baker's less stars than bad#ss, they just don't get it! There are missing something in life and can't see past the flaws to enjoy this so special and unique soulful experience. All places should strive to be their best, and all places should have employees who strive to be their best. But you have to see places for what they are, and without knowing anything about the owners, I doubt they have any intention of being a ""drinking"" establishment or anything close to a highly rated restaurant. This is a jazz places that is about music, art, an era that has escaped us...so soak it all in and enjoy it for what it is. If you want prompt, perfect service where a waiter asks you 25 times how the food is, in some pristine but souless environment - head to suburbia and some national chain. Instead of worrying about it taking 15 minutes to get a drink (which happened to me), take in the history and voices within the walls of the place.FYI - don't forget to make reservations if you want to go!"

11/8/2013,5 star rating,"What a great place!I was really unsure about trying this place, I had drove by hundreds of times but I guess the exterior decor threw me off. Never judge a book by its cover!I went on a Friday night, paid $10.00 cover charge, which is reasonable because they have live JAZZ bands playing and your paying for the wonderful experience.I went with my best friend but next time I'd go with my hubby, they have cute little booths in front of the band to sit in or larger tables in other sections. It was a mixed crowd of people and the food we ordered was delicious (chicken, pork chops, macaroni & yams)The best part of the place was our waitress named 'Laura' if you ever eat here make sure you ask for her because she was excellent, very attentive and on time with everything... we heard she was good so we asked for her specifically and we are glad we did. Check Out Bakers... you wont be disappointed :)"
5/16/2014,4 star rating,Delicious food! Fried Chicken and Mac and Cheese were perfect! The greens were not bad. Cornbread was good! Drinks were delicious and strong. Burger and fries were phenomenal according to my bf. The music was amazing! Awesome band playing on a Saturday night. I had to dock a star because service was incredibly slow and the place is so cramped. No breathing room at all! Other than that this is a great place to spend with your significant other on date nights. I will definitely return soon!
9/14/2011,4 star rating,"I was privilege to go here during my last trip to Detroit. I always had the desire to come to the oldest Jazz club in America. This was a treat from the beginning with the bar counter mimicking that of a piano and the nice attendant at the door. My friend and I got a booth and it would have been perfect if my friend was a girl, a girl i was interested in, because it was a great setup for that. Small 2 person L shaped booths. However he wasn't a girl, and we were too close for comfort. Unfortunately we went during the week and there was only a DJ, no live performances which deterred from the experience, but thanks to the DJ, I now consider myself a Donny Hathaway fan :) The food was great and totally worth it. Anyway, the location is right off of 8 mile and if anyone listens to eminem, you will realize why i was scared even when only walking from my car to the place. You really don't want to walk around here by yourself."

12/31/2010,5 star rating,"Baker's is a Detroit landmark and one that should not be missed. We were lucky to have some friends introduce to the oldest Jazz club in the world a couple years ago, and its now one of my favorite Detroit spots. It's age shows, but that's part of the ambiance. The keyboard bar is the first thing you see when you walk in, and then you'll enter the teeny dining room where you're practically on stage with the band! It's always festive and full of a diverse crowd out to have a great night of music and drink.The drinks are priced right and always strong. The catfish dinner is all I've ever had to eat, but it's amazing! Soul food at it's best. Make sure you get the Mac 'n Cheese side too, one of my favorites - almost as good as my great grandma's!  The cobbler is great as well - if you have room for dessert.Don't let the slightly out of the way location throw you - this is a great spot. If you like live jazz and strong drinks, don't miss Baker's Keyboard Lounge."

I paid$3 to park however,  there was no cover.  My turkey chops were AWESOME complimented by 2 glasses of wine.  I was so impressed,  I took another dinner to go for a friend.   Total I spent approximately 50 dollars.  Not to mention the band rocked out.   Nice work team!!"
7/3/2015,1 star rating,"I have frequented Bakers since I was a kid. This place holds a special place in my heart as my grandparents, parents and once me and my family swore by this historic landmark . Read the details below to understand more about my 1 star review and how this saddens me.Pros: The food is great (when hot) and never disappoints.  The portion sizes are great and the entertainment is always awesome!Con: The cost to dine here is high and one of the reasons we stopped coming weekly. It's $2-5  to park. Sometimes a $5 cover per person all before you get in the door. Lately, the food has not been hot and we have had to request the server microwave it before bringing it out.  Recent Experience: on my recommendation, afew girlfriends came down on a Thursday  to meet for our weekly girls night out. The service was SLOW and the establishment  severely short staffed. When we did get our food it was cold (below room Temperature).  Our drinks were $10-15 for wine and cut drinks. Also, there are no soda refills. We were not  aware of the alacarte service for everything,  our bill was shocking. Like over $250 for 5 people is reasonable if we had great service.  After paying, we requested a manager/owner to provide feedback on our experience . Wrong choice! He told my friend this is not a ""McDonald's"". Not a good thing to tell a group of engineers and consultants.  He even said I will take $10 off but that's all. Hmmm He didn't realize we already paid and tipped our server (who was very apologetic and it was not her fault). That ended my Bakers journey.  Back to Troy, downtown and Royal Oak I  go :-("
5/26/2019,1 star rating,"Was there yesterday with a group of 8 to celebrate my coworkers birthday. We got there at 6pm.  The manager tells us that we would have to leave once the band starts since we did not make any reservations. We asked if we could stay if there were any cancellations. We said he'd have to see. Then our waiter comes over to inform us that their frier was down so certain foods wouldn't be available. We order drinks and food. In total, I had ordered a salad, one long island, 3 martini's the whole night. My bill came up to $72.00 with the gratuity already added. I saw that they had charged me an extra $2 per martini because I'd asked if they could make it with Tito's vodka which isn't a premium liquor but to them it is. Guess I see why they don't have drink menus. Had I known this, I wouldn't have order any drinks. It would've been nice if our waiter informed me of the extra charge before hand. This was my first time there and it will be my last!"

12/18/2011,5 star rating,"El Queso Grande: ""So where is this place Baker's anyways?""Fats: ""Looks like it's about 19 minutes outside of Detroit downtown""EQG: ""So is it by 8 Mile?""F: ""No, I doubt it...I'm pretty sure 8 Mile is much further away""15 minutes later, we were diving down Livernois Avenue, whizzing by shrimp shacks, check cashing joints and even a few combo fast food + check cashing stores...Then we passed 7 mile and El Queso Grande started laughing...Ok, yes, it's true!  Baker's is actually at the intersection of Livernois Ave & 8 Mile Rd.  Park your car in the private parking lot next to the building and a guy will approach you and ask for $2 for parking.  It's all perfectly legitimate, and more importantly, Baker's is completely worth the trip!Baker's is THE OLDEST JAZZ CLUB IN THE WORLD (not just the U.S.)!  It's a must-see for any jazz lover with fantastic musicians, friendly staff and excellent soul food!Awesome catfish, delightfully classic mac and cheese, good cabbage and hands down, the best collard greens I've ever had!  The prices are so low, they are practically giving the food away.  We got a catfish dinner (big enough for 2) for only $12.95 with 2 sides included.  By splitting the platter, we managed to leave enough room for Peach Cobbler with Vanilla Ice Cream ($5), which was splendid!PARTING THOUGHT: There are some very slick jazz clubs in Detroit with all new decor and not a hair out of place, but they don't hold a candle to Baker's when it comes to quality of music, true authenticity and real midwest hospitality.  Go and see for yourself!"
4/3/2017,3 star rating,"Went Friday night for a friend's birthday party to Baker's. Haven't been there in the evening for a couple of years as Cliff Bell's downtown had become our go to jazz-dining spot. We had t owait for the happy hour show to clear out and took us about 30 min .past reservation time to get seated. Place was packed and the pre-recorded music was too loud for any real conversation. We asked the DJ to turn it down until the band started and he begrudgingly said ok. Waitress did a yeoman's job getting us our food udner the conditions. I wasn't really expecting anything outstanding and I was correct. Good basic soul food with good sized protions. I had the salmon patties and black eyed peas and my wife had the short ribs with collard greens. Both were good but not great. Others at the table, there were 8 of us, felt the same way I believe. no one raved about their food.Mxed drinks were good and a limited selection of bottled beers represented by the standard mainstays of American beer. The band the L7 Latin Music Sound Machine were outstanding. We stayed for two sets and enjoyed them immensely. Unfortunately, there really is no dance floor in this venerable jazz club. A few folks got up and danced in the narrow isleway but most folks sat in their seats and bopped to the rhythms. Would highly recommend going their as an entertainment destination but would eat dinner somewhere else beforehand. One hint, on weekends make reservations evne for the music. Lots of folks got turned away."
2/28/2015,4 star rating,"We love this place .  Great Jazz and food in a classic setting.  This historic venue is really unlike any other in the city for the talent that comes through here and the homestyle cooking .  My wife and I both love this place and have been going here for years.  You have to try the catfish and candied yams, not necessarily  in that combination but you haven't lived until you had at least one.  I hear from my better half that the mac and cheese is pretty tasty too.  So if you're in the mood for classic jazz in cozy setting with great food to match , this is the place to be.   Great waitstaff with excellent service.  No matter how crowded it is we never have to wait long for our food."
1/31/2011,5 star rating,"Yummy food, good music, strong ass drinks and a cool relaxing vibe. It took me awhile to get here and longer to write it up (my visit was awhile back). I read online though it is going up for auction today :(.The night we went, we had a catfish and a fried chicken dinner and split them between us. It worked nicely for us. Both were delicious but I give a slight edge to the chicken. The sides of mac and cheese, yams and collard greens all worked well, nicely tasty.  Potato salad was just ok but I am super picky and should not order it anyway. Drinks are of the have-one-and-hello-I'm-drunk variety. I had two for good measure but I am a lush. The service was friendly and the place was so welcoming. Everyone seems to be in a congenial mood here, patrons and staff. You feel at home in the very small space. You are so close to everything that you feel as if you are really a part of the experience, a part of the music. You get kind of swept up here.I am sad if the reports are true."

12/26/2008,4 star rating,"Before I moved to LA, I lived right down the street from this place. I just so happen to want to try something different and based on some fellow yelpers and friend reviews, I went and was PLEASANTLY surprised! I even met a girl from LA there! What a small world!BUT (yes, there is a but and not my backside) I was NOT impressed by the food :( I had the baked chicken dinner and it was dryer than a damn desert. My friend had the fried chicken dinner and you could tell the oil needed to be changed. He didn't touch much of his double deep fried in old grease chicken so I have to take away a star for that.Overall, this is a nice place to chill, listen to some good music, play footsies under the table and have a geniunely good time.

3/7/2011,5 star rating,"I'm in L-O-V-E.Jazz and fried chicken...what's not to adore?  Hit up this Detroit gem and fall head-over-heels for every little detail about this place.  Why I fell in love?  I'm a geek for dim restaurants, small + cozy two-person booths, service where I feel like I'm in my mom's house and live music.  Top it all off with its rich history, and you have real marriage material on your hands.  Dinner.  Make sure you get it here.  I've tried the catfish, which is pretty good but if you know a good cardiologist, order the fried chicken dinner instead.  I only eat fried chicken once every few months and I save those times for trips to Baker's.  The fried chicken dinner comes with about a half a chicken, fried to a perfect crisp, and is served with two sides; get the collard greens (so so so freaking good).  There definitely will be enough to take home, but it does taste best fresh and hot.  The next day, the chicken breast can be a little bit dry (lesson learned).  There are tons of sides to choose from.  Skip the green beans and baked potato, opt for black eyed peas, mac and cheese or the greens.  Last time, the mac and cheese was perfect, but other visits, its been just alright.Oh, eat that corn muffin....that sucker is tasty.  I even asked for an extra one to go with my leftovers.  The waitress was sweet enough to pack two for me.  Imagine my huge smile when I saw two of those babes in my to-go container during my lunch the next day.  Drinks.  Yep...bottoms up to strong drinks!  Enjoying a cocktail or two or three is a must when taking in some Jazz at Bakers.  And drinks are extra delicious when served by an awesome waitress.  Service here is usually great; our server we kept on getting the past few times has the been the sweetest girl ever.  Music.  It's Baker's, 'nuff said.  Check the website for upcoming entertainment.  Sunday nights are cool because you get people signing up to perform all night.  Sometimes, you'll catch some awesome (and sometimes, super young) talent here.  It never fails to amaze.    So yea, Bakers....I'm in love.  Will you marry me?"
1/13/2008,5 star rating,"There are at least 50 reasons why Baker's Keyboard Lounge is one of   my FAVORITE places in Detroit. However, since we don't have that kind of time, here are three.1. The Music - Thats a given. As the oldest jazz club in North America, this place doesn't skip a beat. Regardless of who they've got scheduled on any given night, the talent never ceases to impress. 2. The Food - I recall first tasting their rumored to be amazing Mac n' Cheese. When I finally tasted that first bite, I was stunned. Straight up THE BEST soulfood Mac and Cheese I have EVER tasted! Try it with the fried White fish or Catfish and a side of greens. If you have any room left try the bread or banana pudding.  Hot damn!!!  3. The Drinks - With a two drink minimum, drinks are upwards of $10+. If your tolerance is low, there is a good chance that is all you need. The  alcohol to mixer ratio (if thats how you roll) is about 80/20. On a chilly winter's night or a nice humid summer, their drinks will warm you up quickly. If you ever find yourself in Detroit, there is no reason why you shouldn't stop by Baker's as this place embodies much of the Detroit that people search for."
10/4/2012,3 star rating,"Came here for the first time a few weeks ago. I think its pretty cool this place is the oldest jazz club in the world. The area is unfortunately sketchy, but I expected this. Inside was a little cramped but we were close to the stage which was nice. The staff was friendly when we arrived.  The food was ok...nothing to brag about. I am also pretty sure the waitress forgot to bring our dinner out because after 50 minutes of waiting they still had not reached our table. I got the attention of one of the staff and the dinner came out not even two minutes later after I said something...what a coincidence...The drinks were nice and strong but really pricey, geez! At the end of the night we somehow ended up with two waitresses and they both gave us a bill. It was a little frustrating that they allowed this to happen."
5/1/2015,1 star rating,"This is not a review of the entertainment, which would be 5 plus stars.  The food and service for dinner are the worst I have experienced.  2.2 hours for our food. 1 hour to tell me that they were out of what I ordered (ribs).  When the food came, they never brought my second side despite saying it ""was on its way.""  4 out of 5 people at my table got their food, and our server argued with us over whether the fifth person ordered anything - which he did. Go for drinks and entertainment.  Don't go for the dinner."
1/18/2010,5 star rating,"Baker's is awesome.Where else can you get 3+ hours of awesome jazz for 5 bucks?  This past friday was the Glenn Tucker quartet.  For as young as he is, he is an amazing pianist.  We had a great spot right in front of the stage so we could see everything.  Ralph Armstrong was playing bass.  He was amazing to watch and listen to.  For as busy as they were, service was pretty good.  Everyone was friendly.  We had fried chicken.  It was really tasty, but a couple bites were pretty salty.  Not quite as good as the fried chicken at beans and cornbread.  The greens and mac and cheese were good, but not great.  All and all, i thought the food was a great value considering that for my purposes, it's the sideshow at Baker's.My only real complaint is only Maker's Mark and Jim Beam for bourbon?  Come on, it's a jazz club.  The pours were tall, though, and the other drinks were pretty strong.  Not a bad deal at all.(private parking in the lot is only 3.00.  get there early (8ish), it's worth it for both parking and getting a good table near the stage)."
10/14/2009,1 star rating,"The positives of Baker's lounge is the fact that it is one of oldest and last standing venues from the jazz era.  I've been to Baker's several times and the food is among the best of the many Soul Food restaurants in the Detroit area.  My personal favorites are the mac & cheese, greens, and fried chicken (not good for my high cholesterol !!).  I recommend this during lunch time or after work.What I don't like, particularly as a jazz purist, is the level of performers.  This is not to say that I haven't caught a few good acts from time to time, but the essence of jazz standards, bebop, and more authentic sounds are unfortunately rare to experience at this venue.  The typical performer at Baker's can be found at any club with the 'jazz' title, which does not necessarily classify it as so.  This is a great disappointment for me being that Baker's is a gem, not just in Detroit but to the jazz community world-wide.  The level of customer service can be much better too.  I seriously doubt that the staff are trained to regard Baker's as the historically rich venue that it is.  Their staff is no different than any other Detroit restaurant.  As a customer, I never felt like I was in a 'special' place besides my own personal knowledge of Baker's history.  The management and staff should embrace that and provide several creative ways to make everyone who walks in the door to do the same.Baker's is nice if you are looking for good food and a few drinks.  As for the music, a jazz historian would be a bit disappointed in that the soul of the numerous legends that have blessed the stage are fading fast."
6/21/2010,5 star rating,"The menu consists of soul food; I had the fried catfish with mac & cheese and green beans, and a corn muffin.The food alone is worth the trip, but you really have to experience it when there's a live show going on.  It's an incredible atmosphere - all the jazz greats have played Baker's."
8/10/2008,5 star rating,"Truly an institution. Great atmosphere and performers second-to-none, I love taking people unfamiliar with Detroit here. Going here makes you cool. Can't say enough about Baker's: this place is the real deal. From the piano to the wrap around booths & Detroit decor, this place is sure to entertain.The jazz will get you in the door but the soul food will keep you coming back. The fried chicken was cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Homemade NC-style hot sauce is a great accent. Also, get the Mac-n-cheese as a side is great. Order a gin martini to up your cool ante."
5/2/2011,4 star rating,"4.5 stars. Fried chicken- what is there not to love.I stopped in Detroit on my most recent trip to east Michigan, and my friend suggested fried chicken. After talking about how we both love fried chicken like Church's and Popeye's, we decided to try something new and interesting. Off we went to yelp, for a consult.After reading the reviews, Baker's sounded pretty good. We both had no clue where it was, and quickly drove out there, on a late Sunday afternoon.When you walk in, you're greeted with a cozy environment. A guy sitting near the door told us to ""sit wherever you like!"" and off we were led to a small booth. Apparently, they play jazz here- when we went, a teacher was teaching little kids jazz (they even had all their instruments out and everything!)We split the 6 wing dinner- and chose the mac n cheese and potato salad as sides. The sides...were okay. I thought the mac n cheese could have been better...and my friend and I had different opinions about potato salad (my view is...how could you possibly mess that up?).The fried chicken was pretty good. Good breading, crunchy, hot, and meaty. I approve. Not amazingly out of your mind amazing, but pretty pretty good. We finished it (had even a small cornbread on the plate as well), and was stuffed as a result.I think this place would be definitely even cooler if live jazz was playing. Next time, I'll come back during that time....."
9/9/2008,5 star rating,"FANTASTIC!  Bakers is the oldest jazz restaurant/club in the country. The moment you step in, it feels like you are a part of history.This was one of my favorite date restaurants in Detroit.  It was pretty cheap, the entertainment/music was phenomenal, and the ambiance was really smooth/sexy.WHen you first walk into Bakers, it is impossible not to notice the bar which is fashioned after a piano.  Usually crowded on a Friday night, this is a tight little spot to grab a drink...fortunately, the drinks are well worth it.Typically you can get wait times (on weekends) that are up to an hour, but I was usually sat relatively quickly as pp are coming and going all through out the evening.The service leaves a lot to be desired for....I have had waits that you wouldnt imagine, but honestly, all well worth it once that plate of piping hot soul food reaches you...I have seen a number of incredible performers, and even some incredible folks that have come in out from the audience.The setting is intimate, and you will usually feel like you are right on top of the folks that you are next to...and it probably is because you are.Fried Porkchops/chicken/mac & cheese/collard greens/cabbage....ITS ALL GOOD...you cannot go wrong at this place...period."
10/10/2010,5 star rating,This is the kind of Club that you think only exists in the Past.Welcome to 1934.Soul Food is good.Booths are classicService is good.Music is outstanding and your as close to the stage as you can be.We are all fortunate to have Bakers in Detroit.A class act.
9/25/2015,1 star rating,The service at Bakers keyboard lounge is always slow and the prices of the food and drinks are too expensive the place needs a major remodeling job. The manager Ed has a bad attitude but the owner Eric is wonderful however I will never patronize this business again
12/10/2016,1 star rating,"I came all the way from Chicago with group of 25 people because I heard this was a great place.........BUT THE INSULT THAT MY GROUP RECEIVED WHEN THE MANAGER REFUSED TO SERVE US WAS BEYOND WORDS. The place was practically empty but because there was a performer scheduled for 2 1/2 after our groups arrival, we were refused service because the manager felt we would not leave the restaurant in rime. With the financials issues that we constantly here about in Detroit, how could anyone turn a group of 25 away at 5:30 in the evening with hardly anybody inside. I hate to say but this isn't worth a penny. THEY COULD CARE LESS ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS, ITS ALL ABOUT THE SHOW."
6/15/2008,5 star rating,"For Father's Day, I wanted to take my son and his father to Baker's because every Sunday they have Jazz for Kids, which is a jazz workshop for people up to the age of 18.  I thought it would be fun to eat some good soul food while being around other families.The free Workshop starts at 2pm on Sundays and goes until 4pm.  Kids bring in their instruments and are mentored by a teach who doesn't mess around.  There were a few sax players, a trumpet player, some piano players, and a drummer -- all jammin' together.  My 10 month old loved watching and listening!  The highlight:  listening to youth freestyle on their instruments.They accept donations to keep this program running.  I got to see some young talent improv together.  You can just come in and join the fun, he works with your child at their learning level.  All this happens during lunch time, when Baker's has special lunch prices."
6/11/2008,5 star rating,"Baker's Keyboard Lounge is hands-down AMAZING.  It's one of the best places I've been to in Detroit.  I only wish I was able to get here more often.Let me tell you, I love soul food.  If you could look in my heart, you would find a huge spot for it.  Baker's has amazing fried chicken, and the sides are so delicious that it makes me long for them like a long lost love.  Collard greens, yams, beans, ribs, catfish, mac 'n cheese -- they have all the basic favorites.I've just been here for their lunch (they have great specials), but I would love to come here for the nightlife.  The atmosphere is great -- the bar looks like a grand piano.  I'm not a huge jazz fan but I'd be willing to let this place help me get a vibe for it.  I know it is rich in history and is the ""oldest"" jazz club in the world.  Don't know where to go in Detroit?  Come here, nothing else beats it."
12/28/2016,5 star rating,"Always a good time! I love this place; the food, staff,  musicians, and other guests. Try it out, you'll love it!"
4/20/2017,5 star rating,"Haven't been here in many years because I no longer live in Detroit. But I always recommend this place to all my friends. The fried chicken is my favorite, so flavorful and juicy. The live music is also fantastic and there's really not much places like this anymore. It just feels very authentic and like the last of its kind. I look forward to going back when I visit I'm a few months!"
8/31/2010,4 star rating,"Not from Michigan but have been to jazz clubs from Wash DC to San Diego.  Bakers is the real deal.  The music was great. Its size allows for that intimate feeling that energizes musicians to produce their best work. The food and drinks are excellent.  I was even able to video the band for my blog as long as I did not get in the way. It's down off 8 Mile Road and the neighborhood is somewhat challenged, but DONT STAY AWAY!  This is a great spot if a grown up music experience is for you."
8/28/2015,5 star rating,"This is the 3rd soul food restaurant that I've tried in Detroit. Clearly I should have come here first. I ordered catfish nuggets, fried chicken wings, fried pork chops, greens, Mac-n-cheese and dressing. From past experience I learned to order more than one entree in case one sucks. Not in this case! Everything was delicious! This is the type of soul food that I'm accustomed to eating. I'm from Chicago with roots in Mississippi and Louisiana and this food tasted like my momma cooked it. I strongly recommend the food. They also have live jazz at this venue so I say come for the food and stay for the show. Enjoy!"
10/3/2008,4 star rating,"After living in Detroit most of my life I am ashamed to say that I had never made it to Bakers. One reason is that I'm not the biggest jazz fan so I didn't really see a need to go until I watched a movie titled ""Harlem Nights"". For some strange reason it made me think of Bakers so I called up the crew and we decided to roll out.I really enjoyed the evening at Bakers. I felt real grown up. The crowd was mature and you can really tell that the people here are all about the music. I of course took advantage of the soul food menu minus the meat. I loaded up on greens and stuffing. It is a tight fit with seating but well worth the experience.There were people of all age ranges in the house this particular Friday night. Couples, friends, first dates, and regulars. The music was timeless and my spirit was in much need of some ""real"" music. You know the kind that conjures up all sorts of feelings that allow you to just let go and be in spite of what may be happening in your life. I will definitely be making Bakers a habit!"
3/26/2014,4 star rating,"Me and my coworkers order takeout for lunch from Bakers every once in a while (Its at least a 15 minute drive from where i work). They have affordable and satisfying lunch options and portions. The food taste excellent. I am a big fan of the fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, and greens. I've never eaten on the inside but the place has a cool, jazz like ambiance."
7/18/2014,3 star rating,"So I decided to check this place out based on the great reviews I read right here on Yelp! The reviews were great and the pics of the food looked good as well. So I went to get the catfish lunch special. I had mac n cheese and yams as my sides. Plus I added the peach cobbler. The portions were more than enough for me. Service was also nice as well. My meal came to $13.Catfish: It was hot, crispy, and fried just right. I took a bite and wasn't exactly liking the seasoning that was used. It was just ok to me.Mac N Cheese: It looked great. I took a bite and it was good, but needed some pepper in it or something. It was ok.Yams: They were good.Corn bread muffin: Tasty!Peach Cobbler: It's ok as well. More cobbler than peaches. Doesn't taste like my moms but it passed.I'm good and full, but not sure if I will return. I'm thinking of giving them a second chance, but not anytime soon."
1/15/2017,4 star rating,"Best jazz lounge in Detroit and they have the best fried chicken. I had made a reservation on a Saturday night and was running behind. Called to let them know - they will hold you table for about 10 minutes. Well I was 15 minutes late and they gave our table away however they said as soon as one opened up near the stage they would seat us. Sure enough, no one forgot about us and they remembered my name! Very impressed."
4/10/2011,4 star rating,"Great music.  They really rocked out.Tight quarters.  You may end up sitting with strangers, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing.Good food.  I had fried catfish, black-eyed peas over rice, and cole slaw.There was a $5 cover this weekend.  Again, very reasonable.I will be returning to this awesome venue!"
8/2/2016,2 star rating,"Food was ok, drinks were good, service was iffy, band was amazing, the environment...... Terribly terribly hot, was the air conditioner broke or something!?!?!? They need to limit how many ppl come in or build a bigger venue. Also they need to invest in security, and a younger more perceptive parking attendant AND a bigger parking lot. My car and 3 others were broken into right outside of their establishment and nothing was done. I won't be back ."
1/11/2017,4 star rating,"I had lunch at Bakers today. I had no idea it was even open at lunch time. I had not been here in 30 years. When I did come in, it was never for the food. Great JAZZ, drinks and atmosphere. What I found today was a place that has been around forever, still looks about the same. I think the booths were the ones from 30 years ago but I cant remember.  The Piano style bar looks amazing. A small stage was set up in the dining room next to a very old and weathered grand piano. Some amazing artwork on the walls dated 1952 from Miami Beach, New Orleans, New York and London. Now for the food. This is classic ""Soul Food"". My waitress said they were known for their chicken. They had a chicken wing special with side dishes for $9.  I was leaning toward the Pickerel, but decided on the Catfish. I wanted two filets instead of one so opted for the dinner portion for just $2 more. I had collard greens and a baked potato as my two sides. While I was waiting for my meal, the table across from me  with 3 ladies was just being served. They each got the wings and it looked pretty good. I over heard them saying how creamy the mac and cheese was and it looked good too!. I was starting to feel I made the wrong selection when mine came out.  Two nice size deep fried catfish filets. Perfect color, nice crunch to the batter but not heavy. The fish was pretty good, a tiny bit mushy...but hey it's catfish. The greens were fresh made and you can tell. Very Good. Baked potato was ok...its just a baked potato...I should have got that mac and cheese. The meal came with a cornbread muffin which I lathered in real butter and devoured. All in all I was happy I stopped in and hope to be back in the evening for some entertainment and more good food. Thanks for keepin' it real."
3/6/2017,5 star rating,"After seeing reviews below about how busy this place is I called a few days before my intended visit and made a reservation for two. When we got there a few minutes before our reservation time we were told our reservation wasn't on file but that they would try to get us into a table and we were offered a discount on the cover charge for the inconvenience. Thankfully there were two seats available at the bar for us to sit at until a table became available. We were able to enjoy the music from the bar since it's close to the stage and true to their word, they got us in at a table only about an hour after our reservation time. Due to the small space, be prepared to share a table with other people. We had eaten ahead of time but couldn't resist ordering the catfish nuggets and mac 'n cheese, both of which were amazing, so good we almost ordered a 2nd helping! The servers and bar staff were friendly and prompt with their service and Jackie the bartenders drinks were so strong when we sat at the bar it was like getting 3 drinks in 1! I was disappointed when I heard our reservations weren't on file but they more than made up for that, enough that I am still giving this place 5 stars. The music was great, so different than any other live band I've ever seen as this was my first trip to a jazz/blues bar. The building/decor itself isn't fancy by any means, it has an underground, industrial look and there doesn't appear to be a dance floor but none of that bothered me. Will definitely go back again soon and not eat first and will make a reservation ahead of time again too after seeing how busy it really does get here BUT will get the person's name that takes my reservation just in case so I have that info should my original issue happen again. One more thing, parking is limited in the bar's lot, we had to park on the street across from the bar."
7/8/2011,5 star rating,"I went to Baker's Keyboard Lounge with my friend and her roommates on a Tuesday night. They told me the establishment had recently been turned over to new owners and they wanted to see if they changed anything. From what I understand, nothing has changed. It's the oldest jazz club in the world, so how could they?I ordered the friend chicken with a salad and mac n cheese. I was expecting just a breast and a leg but I was basically given a half a chicken! So much food and so delicious, especially the mac n cheese. The only problems were that they were training some new waitresses, so there was a little confusion there. If you want to park in the private lot, be prepared to shell out two bucks; I'm not sure why we had to pay for parking. If you don't want to pay, you can park on one of the side streets around the restaurant. Also, since we were there on a Tuesday night, arguably one of the slowest nights for all restaurants, the place was nearly empty. I wish I could have seen it in full weekend swing; even though it was empty, it still had a great vibe.You definitely get a lot for your money, plus some great live music. A must if you are visiting Detroit!"
4/15/2017,1 star rating,"Bakers wIll always have a place in my heart a jewel with great food and excellent bar tending by Jackie & Tae ...Stopped patronizing 10 years ago because of JC ( poor -rude customer service) recently returned because of new ownership...But over the past few months it would appear that the ""ghost of JC"" has been reincarnated in the form of ""John G "" who is so very ""unwelcoming "" at the door... ""if one has to pay money to sit at the bar and spend money"" then one should receive good customer service at the door and not feel like"" it's a stick up "" !"
1/29/2014,5 star rating,"This is the classic jazz joint I would recommend to anyone. Weekends are crowded, and sometimes have nationally known musicians. The food is decent (but not great). We don't come here for the food. At least the drinks are not watered down. It has the flavor of an old time ""speak"". This is truly one of Detroit's jewels. When I have guests from out of town I take them here - more enjoyable than the usual ""Greenfield Village"" routine."
9/5/2014,4 star rating,"In spite of sitting right under the speaker, I'm glad to have spent my Friday night there. After seeing the food brought out to another table, I wish I had saved my appetite to eat there."
9/27/2012,5 star rating,Still Fantastic.  Was fortunate to sit next to Jim Gallert (detroitmusichistory.com) who knew the whole band.  It was great hearing the history of Baker's.   No seat is more than 20 feet from the stage.  Folks come for birthday parties and the like.  Strangers share their cake with you and everyone is really in the same party at the same time.
7/15/2009,5 star rating,"Fantastic and Joyful. BKL is absolutely fantastic.  I took my clients there while i'm out here on business.  For you West coasters who want truly American experiences, they don't get any finer than Baker's Keyboard Lounge.  Some points:1) I never felt unsafe.  Sure, most western denizens, have heard of '8 mile' and they think it's a rough neighborhood that should be avoided.  Relax. You're fine here and you can bring a date and everything.2) Speaking of dates, the boothes in the back are built for two. 3) NOT smoky.  I don't know if BKL has a non-smoking policy now, but i would have expected a very smoky room.  I picture Bill Evans playing 'Waltz for Debby' and going thru 1/2 a pack during his set, but nope.  No one was smoking at BKL. 4) The food.  It's not that healthy for you physically, but very good for you spiritually.  The Mac&cheese is great, as is the cornbread.  My clients ordered smothered porkchops; anything with the adjective 'smothered' in the title is the bee's knees. In today's day & age, many in America dismiss DTW as a 'flyover' state, and they miss experiences like Baker's Keyboard Lounge.  I travel 100K+ miles for business a year; most trips I forget, but not this one.  Come visit DTW and support Baker's Keyboard Lounge."
11/11/2008,4 star rating,"Pretty cool place.  Good music and decent food.  It was pretty crowded, but it's still a cool atmosphere.  There is a bar and a loungey side - the bar was really smoky, but the other side didn't seem as bad.The waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed tonight and the food plates for our 10 person party came out about 5 minutes apart - a bit annoying.If you come prepared to be a bit squished at your table or booth and don't expect perfect service, you'll know what to expect and you'll have a good time."
10/2/2014,5 star rating,"Great music, great food and great drinks...what more could you ask for. Bakers definitely lives up to the reputation it has. A small intimate jazz spot, with great entertainers. They played hit after hit. I had the chicken wings with mac and cheese and corn and def wasn't disappointed. The waitresses were attentive and polite. Really glad I found my way to this gem."
9/27/2008,4 star rating,"Music makes the ambiance here. It is a classic nationally known spot for jazz. Talented young jazz players from Wayne State and other nearby colleges play here often, adding their own subtle twists on old jazz along with the seniors in the who play here as well. Ask the staff and some artists have been playing here 20+ years. The food is delicious, if its soul food they have it, from smothered to fried or vegetarian plates. My absolute favorite soul food side is dressing, and they do a version just like grandma would make, with plenty to 'stick to your ribs', oniony, chicken flavored and with sage and bell peppers...just great. The drinks are nice, enough strength to be labeled a 'detroit' serving and heavy enough to keep you laid back through the generous jazz sets. Come and enjoy Baker's! Get your own taste of history."
8/23/2008,4 star rating,"Live Jazz music while dining is always fun! Dim lighting and cozy booths, where you can cuddle with your significant or take a date.  There were larger parties too.Our waitress was great and attentive. I ordered a Sex on the Beach and wanted it stronger...she came back....boy was it stronger....with no extra charge! Average prices dishes. Enjoyed the chicken wings, yams are yummy!I was surprised we had to pay for parking, not much but preferred it free. Otherwise, I enjoyed the experience!"
9/27/2014,4 star rating,"This is a must go if you want to feel in the D. Music changes often, so can't comment on that. Food is pretty good and the service is excellent. The peach cobbler was the best ever!!! Really, it was that good. Very friendly and relaxed atmosphere."
11/9/2007,5 star rating,"Chicken and Jazz.  Couldn't agree more. A great place to take a date and impress with your urban sensitivities and hipster cool jazz knowledge  (or lack thereof).  The ""seating manager"" does an excellent job of finding you a table or even a cozy booth to sit where you can then whisk yourself away to a pre-iTunes time when people actually listened to wonderful, soul-stirring live music.Food: authentic fried chicken, crispy and good.  The fries are phenomenal too, and you can't go wrong with the peach cobbler for dessert."
8/28/2016,5 star rating,"Loved the atmosphere, the live music and the food.  The only bad thing that I can say is that it's really small but it gives you that intimacy feeling. Most definitely would go back."
6/1/2013,5 star rating,"* great fried chicken* would definitely recommend as the go to for detroit.I just came from buffalo and the chicken wings + hot sauce is better than the locals' favs in buffalo. And this place is supposed to be a Jazz+dinner joint. Mainly because they were making good fried chicken and the hot sauce was really just a condiment. I got the  $8 lunch special 6 chicken wings with corn bread and 2 sides. Corn bread came in a muffin shape, and was probably the best corn bread i've had at any fried chicken place. Collard greens were good, but i did wish they added bacon, and were a little less salty. green beans were good. The water did taste a little weird though. It was a huge lunch for me bc the six wings also came with that extra drum stick attached at the end of the wing. The atmosphere was really cool with the piano bar and the locals just chilling. The workers also know the history and try to introduce it to you. There's plenty of history around with pictures of artists who have played there. My friend got the half chicken with mac and cheese and rice+beans. he loved the rice and beans but though the mac cheese was ok. I would definitely come here over popeyes and church's on a regular basis. I heard the catfish was fresh and delicious from the table next to ours."
11/23/2013,2 star rating,"I have wanted to go here for YEARS!  Finally did tonight.  The big mistake was deciding to go for dinner.  We had to ask for menus.  Dinner took forever!  We had a party of 8 and meals were brought out over a period of 20-30 minutes.  20 minutes after my husband's dinner arrived (and mine hadn't), I cancelled mine, and just ate the rest of his.  Thankfully, the portions are HUGE!  The cornbread batter on the fish was good.  I'm sure it's great when it's warm :/  The entertainment was great!  Next time, I will go for the music and dessert.  The peach cobbler is phenomenal!"
3/12/2014,4 star rating,"Such a great place for a night out on the town, relaxing to some jazz. Very busy place. $5 to park in the lot, $10 cover to get in, able to pay with a credit card. We waited about ten minutes to be seated at a very small table, very close to others. The service is a bit spotty. After 15 minutes of waiting, we were about to go to the bar ourselves when she arrived to take our drink order which took another 15 minutes to arrive. We just got some fries which were cold and almost done by the time I had to get up to find the waitress to ask for ketchup for the second time. We decided to take the peach cobbler to go which had some French vanilla ice cream! Very sweet, very good."
1/2/2013,1 star rating,"My boyfriend and I both really like jazz so when we were thinking of what to do for New Year's Eve he suggested Baker's.  I hopped online to check the reviews, almost all of which were glowing.  It seemed like such a bargain.  Two tickets for a show with three different acts, two dinners, and a bottle of champagne for $175.  We would have happily spent twice as much for such a fantastic night out.  I called to find out what was on the menu and to book reservations.  When the man I spoke with on the phone was arranging the seating he gave me options of a booth or a table.  I let him know that we would be fine with either and that it was our first trip to their establishment and that we were very excited to have found such a ""gem.""  He chose the seats for us and told me that we would be in a booth facing the stage.       The big night comes, we get to Baker's and park in the lot.  It was $6 to park (WOW, so Cheap!) and the lot attendant was very pleasant.  We get into the place and it really is a dive bar.  Thankfully I was prepared from the other reviews.  We give the hostess our name and we are led through the lounge where it is obvious they have squeezed in as many tables as possible to maximize cover revenues.  We are led to a small table that is pushed up to another table in a T shape.  There were two other couples seated there already and we were given the remaining seats.  All six of us look uncomfortable with the situation.  These seats face the wall and we are seated with our BACKS to the stage.  I let the young man who was seating us know that this was not the seating arrangement that had been discussed when I booked the reservation.  He seemed uncomfortable and replied that he couldn't really do anything that these were the seats we were assigned.     We waited almost 30 minutes for someone to take our drink order.  It's an ackward 30 minutes.  The music was too loud for any sort of conversation and the tables were too close to allow us to turn our seats 180 degrees to watch the performance.  After the server brought our drinks (at seperate times) it was another 10 minutes before the food arrived.  Ahhh.. the food.  With so many fantastic reviews I was surely in for a treat.  It's New Year's Eve!  I bet they've gone over the top, right?  Wrong.  We were brought plates of food which had obviously been kept in chaffing dishes.  Roast beef, baked chicken, roasted potatoes, green beans and a roll.  I had previously been told that we would also have a piece of their ""famous fried chicken"" but it was not on the plate.  I dig in and was disappointed.  The chicken had a nice flavor but wasn't anything to write home about.  The roast beef was so tough I had trouble cutting it with my steak knife.  The green beans were soggy and over cooked.  I did like the potatoes, though, I'm not sure if it was the potatoes themselves or the sopping mess of roast beef gravy and butter from the beans that had accumlated on my plate.   Our champagne was Korbel (better quality than I had expected).  It arrived during dinner.  When my boyfriend order it he asked for champagne with the ice bucket.  The waitress brought the champagne sans bucket.  This was really the final straw for us.  I will generally stick it out but the thought of warm, flat sparkling wine swayed me when my boyfriend suggested we just leave.  We had given them $190 of our money and were not about to give them the rest of our New Year's Eve.   As we left we were met with the most insincere offer from the management.  (I assume he was the manager)  He never actually introduced himself just said that if we wanted to come back he would comp our dinner and drinks.  He didn't, however take our names, offer his, give us a card or any other way of redeeming his offer."

I love the open jam on Sundays and we finally got to check out the big band which is always the last Sunday of the month (thanks to one of our favorite bartender's , Jackie, advice.) come for the history and stay for the food, music, and friendly folks.

5/14/2011,5 star rating,"I was visiting from NJ and heard about Baker's from a local. It was easy to find for a newbie to Detroit, which is always a plus. The food was great and very reasonably priced - loved the catfish. I stayed for the first set of music on a Saturday night - I'm not knowledgeable about jazz, but I thought the band sounded very good.The biggest plus for me, and the reason I would gladly go back, is the atmosphere. The staff is friendly and I wasn't rushed while eating or listening to the band afterward. Its a very low-key, comfortable ""vibe"".  The bar resembling a keyboard is cool - you can feel the history there."

I ordered the lunch special ($8). Whiting fish, Mac and Cheese and collard greens. The portions were overwhelming for lunch. The fish was seasoned very well. Mac and cheese was cheesy, and the real test was the greens...fantastic! To top off our lunch there was an amazing singer there performing. This place is now on my list and I recommend you try it! My next will be at dinner."

I was told that there is no lunch on Saturdays. When I tried to explain that it's not clear here on yelp I was LIED to and told that they can't control anything that is put on yelp.. That yelp decides what goes on here... As a business owner with my business listed here on yelp that is an out and out right LIE... I tried to inform him of the truth and was told WE REALLY DONT CARE.... Really?! People take the time to review your establishment, people like me and MANY others find you on yelp and when someone tries to help you your response is WE REALLY DONT CARE?!!!! The ONLY reason I gave two stars was because of the food.... The customer service is HORRIBLE & RUDE! I hope everyone calls and floods them with questions about their yelp page!!!!"

1/18/2010,5 star rating,"Baker's is awesome.Where else can you get 3+ hours of awesome jazz for 5 bucks?  This past friday was the Glenn Tucker quartet.  For as young as he is, he is an amazing pianist.  We had a great spot right in front of the stage so we could see everything.  Ralph Armstrong was playing bass.  He was amazing to watch and listen to.  For as busy as they were, service was pretty good.  Everyone was friendly.  We had fried chicken.  It was really tasty, but a couple bites were pretty salty.  Not quite as good as the fried chicken at beans and cornbread.  The greens and mac and cheese were good, but not great.  All and all, i thought the food was a great value considering that for my purposes, it's the sideshow at Baker's.My only real complaint is only Maker's Mark and Jim Beam for bourbon?  Come on, it's a jazz club.  The pours were tall, though, and the other drinks were pretty strong.  Not a bad deal at all.(private parking in the lot is only 3.00.  get there early (8ish), it's worth it for both parking and getting a good table near the stage)."
1/8/2010,5 star rating,"Yes it IS the oldest Jazz club in the world- and you can feel it when you're there. My first time to Bakers was a night I will never forget. This Singer named Renee Jackson (where ever did she go?!) was one of the most brilliant entertainers. She kept us all laughing and engaged the whole night. She took the time to interact with the crowd and really make us all feel at home and a part of it. And then, she opened her mouth to sing and I could have sworn she was some hybrid of Aretha Franklin and Etta James. I was in Jazz heaven. Her band was really something too. Stand up bass, drums and a man on the piano that got into it like he was Stevie Wonder. Just phenomenal!!! If I could relive that night I would. In addition, the fried chicken, collard greens and mac n' cheese are really delicious. Maybe not the best in Detroit, but certainly what you'd expect of some good soul food. They don't skimp on the portions and every table is armed with hot sauce. Places like this aren't just a cool feature in Detroit they ARE what makes this city."
1/1/2010,5 star rating,"what a great way to ring in the new year!bakers keyboard lounge was so much laid back fun.  we helped them celebrate their 75th new year's celebration.the christopher wilson quartet kept the night going with three sets each about 1 hour long.  the members of the band were all younger than me and so talented.  i even got the chance to see my first asian drummer!the bar itself is phenomenal!  shaped like a piano and curvy like me.the food was delicious and i never expected a club to have such good soul food.i had smothered pork chops with mac and cheese, black eyed peas (good luck and fortune for the new year) and collard greens.  the pork chops were everything i wanted.  hot and covered in gravy.  the collard greens were not bitter at all and had a very nice taste.  the mac and cheese was remarkable and the pinto beans had definitely spent some time simmering on the stove.james' fried chicken dinner was actually a half chicken and the hot sauce had some of the best spices ever.  not just going for hot, they were going fo flavor too!.  don't pass up the peach cobbler either.  just the right amount of sweetness.we all enjoyed the experience! the owner was nice enough to announce his appreciation for his customers and helping him through a difficult year right before the new year.it was great to support a detroit institution and have a truly enjoyable evening.  btw, its at 8 and livernois.  ferndale is right across the street.  there is nothing scary about its location at all.love, juston"

10/14/2009,1 star rating,"The positives of Baker's lounge is the fact that it is one of oldest and last standing venues from the jazz era.  I've been to Baker's several times and the food is among the best of the many Soul Food restaurants in the Detroit area.  My personal favorites are the mac & cheese, greens, and fried chicken (not good for my high cholesterol !!).  I recommend this during lunch time or after work.What I don't like, particularly as a jazz purist, is the level of performers.  This is not to say that I haven't caught a few good acts from time to time, but the essence of jazz standards, bebop, and more authentic sounds are unfortunately rare to experience at this venue.  The typical performer at Baker's can be found at any club with the 'jazz' title, which does not necessarily classify it as so.  This is a great disappointment for me being that Baker's is a gem, not just in Detroit but to the jazz community world-wide.  The level of customer service can be much better too.  I seriously doubt that the staff are trained to regard Baker's as the historically rich venue that it is.  Their staff is no different than any other Detroit restaurant.  As a customer, I never felt like I was in a 'special' place besides my own personal knowledge of Baker's history.  The management and staff should embrace that and provide several creative ways to make everyone who walks in the door to do the same.Baker's is nice if you are looking for good food and a few drinks.  As for the music, a jazz historian would be a bit disappointed in that the soul of the numerous legends that have blessed the stage are fading fast."
9/30/2009,4 star rating,"They have the BEST Fried Chicken and Mac & Cheese you can find. Eating in is nice and the jazz music is good, even if you don't care for Jazz. Very Busy on the weekend,  maybe a short wait as the Restaurant is small. They have been around at least 20 + years."

12/26/2008,4 star rating,"Before I moved to LA, I lived right down the street from this place. I just so happen to want to try something different and based on some fellow yelpers and friend reviews, I went and was PLEASANTLY surprised! I even met a girl from LA there! What a small world!BUT (yes, there is a but and not my backside) I was NOT impressed by the food :( I had the baked chicken dinner and it was dryer than a damn desert. My friend had the fried chicken dinner and you could tell the oil needed to be changed. He didn't touch much of his double deep fried in old grease chicken so I have to take away a star for that.Overall, this is a nice place to chill, listen to some good music, play footsies under the table and have a geniunely good time. Another plus side: Strong drinks ;)Glad I finally made it there!!"

11/11/2008,4 star rating,"Pretty cool place.  Good music and decent food.  It was pretty crowded, but it's still a cool atmosphere.  There is a bar and a loungey side - the bar was really smoky, but the other side didn't seem as bad.The waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed tonight and the food plates for our 10 person party came out about 5 minutes apart - a bit annoying.If you come prepared to be a bit squished at your table or booth and don't expect perfect service, you'll know what to expect and you'll have a good time."
10/3/2008,4 star rating,"After living in Detroit most of my life I am ashamed to say that I had never made it to Bakers. One reason is that I'm not the biggest jazz fan so I didn't really see a need to go until I watched a movie titled ""Harlem Nights"". For some strange reason it made me think of Bakers so I called up the crew and we decided to roll out.I really enjoyed the evening at Bakers. I felt real grown up. The crowd was mature and you can really tell that the people here are all about the music. I of course took advantage of the soul food menu minus the meat. I loaded up on greens and stuffing. It is a tight fit with seating but well worth the experience.There were people of all age ranges in the house this particular Friday night. Couples, friends, first dates, and regulars. The music was timeless and my spirit was in much need of some ""real"" music. You know the kind that conjures up all sorts of feelings that allow you to just let go and be in spite of what may be happening in your life. I will definitely be making Bakers a habit!"
9/27/2008,4 star rating,"Music makes the ambiance here. It is a classic nationally known spot for jazz. Talented young jazz players from Wayne State and other nearby colleges play here often, adding their own subtle twists on old jazz along with the seniors in the who play here as well. Ask the staff and some artists have been playing here 20+ years. The food is delicious, if its soul food they have it, from smothered to fried or vegetarian plates. My absolute favorite soul food side is dressing, and they do a version just like grandma would make, with plenty to 'stick to your ribs', oniony, chicken flavored and with sage and bell peppers...just great. The drinks are nice, enough strength to be labeled a 'detroit' serving and heavy enough to keep you laid back through the generous jazz sets. Come and enjoy Baker's! Get your own taste of history."
9/9/2008,5 star rating,"FANTASTIC!  Bakers is the oldest jazz restaurant/club in the country. The moment you step in, it feels like you are a part of history.This was one of my favorite date restaurants in Detroit.  It was pretty cheap, the entertainment/music was phenomenal, and the ambiance was really smooth/sexy.WHen you first walk into Bakers, it is impossible not to notice the bar which is fashioned after a piano.  Usually crowded on a Friday night, this is a tight little spot to grab a drink...fortunately, the drinks are well worth it.Typically you can get wait times (on weekends) that are up to an hour, but I was usually sat relatively quickly as pp are coming and going all through out the evening.The service leaves a lot to be desired for....I have had waits that you wouldnt imagine, but honestly, all well worth it once that plate of piping hot soul food reaches you...I have seen a number of incredible performers, and even some incredible folks that have come in out from the audience.The setting is intimate, and you will usually feel like you are right on top of the folks that you are next to...and it probably is because you are.Fried Porkchops/chicken/mac & cheese/collard greens/cabbage....ITS ALL GOOD...you cannot go wrong at this place...period."
8/23/2008,4 star rating,"Live Jazz music while dining is always fun! Dim lighting and cozy booths, where you can cuddle with your significant or take a date.  There were larger parties too.Our waitress was great and attentive. I ordered a Sex on the Beach and wanted it stronger...she came back....boy was it stronger....with no extra charge! Average prices dishes. Enjoyed the chicken wings, yams are yummy!I was surprised we had to pay for parking, not much but preferred it free. Otherwise, I enjoyed the experience!"
8/10/2008,5 star rating,"Truly an institution. Great atmosphere and performers second-to-none, I love taking people unfamiliar with Detroit here. Going here makes you cool. Can't say enough about Baker's: this place is the real deal. From the piano to the wrap around booths & Detroit decor, this place is sure to entertain.The jazz will get you in the door but the soul food will keep you coming back. The fried chicken was cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Homemade NC-style hot sauce is a great accent. Also, get the Mac-n-cheese as a side is great. Order a gin martini to up your cool ante."
7/12/2008,4 star rating,"Wow, I literally have lived within a mile of Baker's for most of my life, and have never even thought about going in. I guess because I am more of a hip hop fan than anything. However, my guy friend suggested we meet up there last week and much to my surprise, I had a good time. Although the outside is pretty shabby (as are most buildings in Detroit), the inside was still booming.  Around 8pm is when the show begins, so it gets really packed around this time. I couldn't really tell you who was performing, but the music was very excellent and created a homely vibe. Oh, I didn't even mention how great the food was. Of course, I am a soul food type of girl so I enjoyed my entree. If you go, definitely try the sweet potatoes, coleslaw, and the pork chops. The prices are roughly $10-12 dollars for a meal, which isn't too bad. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place for large groups, because it is super tight."
1/1/2012,2 star rating,"NYE 2011 Rematch...Not so good this time. The menu was cut down to 4 entree options, the sides..where's the stinking mac and cheese?! Really! My drink was watered down, the opening comedian, drunk and not funny. The band was good but the singer, can you say light jazz muzak, all covers. I wanted some dirty jazz, a stiff drink, and some mac and cheese. The catfish was good, my potatoes not seasoned, the mixed veggies, out of the frozen food aisle, the hot sauce not hot or spicy, and my peach cobbler was cold. The only redeeming factor was the waitress Krystal. She did her job and did it well. For a $30 ticket that covered nothing but a cramped seat, I will not be back for NYE."

The music speaks for itself. This is an awesome date place and if you love soul food, you will leave satisfied. I'm still having dreams about the peach cobbler. Enjoy!"

We started off with drinks, and the drinks are great.  The food service was a little slow so don't go hungry, but definatley work the wait.  The Catfish and Mac&Cheese was just like Grandma makes it.  The Band was really Good, but we got and added bonus when a Guy named Michael who use to sing with the Dramatics got up to do a few songs with the Band.  He turned a Good Night into a Fabulous Night!  He was a true Performer and Entertainer,  He Sang His Butt off.  All I can say is if you haven't been to Bakers, you haven't been to a Real Jazz Club, can't wait to go back.  Thanks Bakers!"
