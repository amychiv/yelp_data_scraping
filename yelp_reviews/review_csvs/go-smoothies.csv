4 star rating,"I needed a quick healthy breakfast after eating horribly the past week. The guy working was friendly and helpful. I ordered a shot and a smoothie. The shot, I can't remember the name but it has wheatgrass, apple, lemon and ginger, was intense but good. My smoothie, AB&J, was very good and the 12 oz filled me up.Overall, I recommend!"
4 star rating,"Popped in here for a ""meal"" smoothie...Yelp offered 2 free add-ins (saved $2!) for checking in.Met an Aussie lady Kelly right when I walked in (anyone who knows me knows that's my favorite country in the world!) who was grinding up fresh wheat grass ... wow!Was immediately offered Samples of 4 smoothies and the Zing Juice. All delicious. I ordered from the Something Green menu. 12z $8, 16z $9 Incredible Hulk + 2 (free) add-ins:Spinach, lemon, mango, avocado, basil, banana, honey + Van Protein Powder & Kale.It is SO fantastic!! All fresh ingredients, not too much powder and just the right ""thickness"" (not too much watery ice). I would absolutely come here again.Keep in mind: no real parking, but 15mins out front allowed."
5 star rating,"First had a juice from my coach and then my mom once she purchased the D-tox pack. My mother and i went in today and purchased the Wednesday cleanse special; 6 juices for $29. A smoothie was calling me. I knew I wanted one of the ""fill up"" smoothies. It was between the ""Ab&J and ""Vanilla Paradise"" , the young man behind the counter (Vontae*) combined the two. The outcome was DEE-LICIOUS. Will most definitely be back. Parking was no hassle."
4 star rating,"Wonderful place with friendly service, legit juice and vegan food and smoothies that even your hamburger loving BF or husband will love."
5 star rating,"The smoothie maker was so helpful. I ordered the smoothie with kale, banana, Maca, and honey (I can't remember the exact name) and it was So good! I usually don't order smoothies with kale, but the banana, honey was refreshing when the kale taste would come in. I would order again! Such a better alternative than a huge meal, and it was filling at the small cup I ordered."
5 star rating,"Awesome owners. The smoothies were FANTASTIC, maybe the best I've ever had in michigan. We asked for a custom smoothie and they named it after our friend. All fresh fruit, no dairy. And open til 7 which is great for me because I work past 5. I would have given it five stars. But the shop is still really new, so they are going through some growing pains: we had a large group when we came so it took awhile for them to make the smoothies. But if you are rolling through grand circuits with a friend and want a great smoothie for the summer, stop by this place.Ask for the ""Cassie"" :)"
4 star rating,Incredible Hulk was super yummy! I don't like banana so I had them make it without! I drank most of mines before I got back to my desk. The staff is really nice too. I will be back!
5 star rating,"My daughter's a smoothie fanatic, so we tried this place on a Sunday after shopping for glasses at Warby Parker just around the corner. The sign on the door says it's closed Sunday's, but it's not; the sign is just expensive to replace. The owner? saw us loitering outside and opened the door for us (thank you!). My daughter chose the incredible hulk and loved it. My husband had something green and bottled, which was also good. There's something on the menu every health interest, the ingredients look just picked, and it's in a killer location. I would just caution that it's not jamba juice or smoothie king if you're taking more dessert-loving smoothie people here. More the gym-spa-nutritionist smoothie variety."
5 star rating,Visiting from NY. Always looking for delicious nice places. Super yummy. Tons of flavors. Lovely staff.
5 star rating,"The fresh made smoothies are great. I usually run in and grab the cold press juice. I'm a little disappointed in the change in the ""Beet It"" formation. Seems to be thinner and the earthy taste is changed to sugary/sweeter. Bring back the raw flavor-- that's the good stuff."
4 star rating,"Walked in yesterday to find there was only ONE person doing everything! Taking orders, then making the smoothie/juice, then rinsing the blender, then repeating. There was a line to the door and no music playing or anything and was just a big fail. Whoever owns this place, get more staff!!!!"
1 star rating,"I have supported this business for several years, but I just can't justify the cost (that has gone up several times as quality has gone down!). The juices and smoothies are just o-k in taste and overpriced! I paid $10 for a smoothie that was made with conventional strawberries from Gordon Food Services. If I am going to pay $10 for a smoothie, the strawberries should at least be organic! I'll stick with Beyond Juice in Eastern Market where the smoothies are half the price and taste better..."
2 star rating,"These ladies are awesome! If I lived here then I would come here on a regular basis. Their juices are good and it's important to support local businesses over chain stores / restaurants.Cheers to good health, great juices, and a fantastic juice and smoothie bar in Detroit!"
5 star rating,Terrible customer service. First girl took our order then answered a phone call and walked away. Second Girl was on her phone instead of taking our order. She did not even acknowledge us. So we stood there until third worker came to take our order. The entire experience was bad. Smoothie was just alright but not bc of the people who work there.
1 star rating,My wife and I stopped by this morning for the first time and I must say the three gentlemen that greeted us was very informative very nice and most of all makes some great smoothies plus their ingredients aren't frozen like Whole Foods so yep you got my business for now on
5 star rating,The staff are extremely helpful in finding what you'll like and the smoothies are to die for! They have tons of extras you can add as well as great juices and wheatgrass shots (Oh Baby is my fave). Love this place!
5 star rating,Very friendly owners. The juices are great and they will be offering well training soon.
4 star rating,I usually go to tropical smoothie cafe but there wasn't one close so I stopped here instead. I paid $9 for a smoothie half the size of what I normally get. So that's twice the price for half the serving. Then the person at the counter spilled a good portion of my drink and still charged the $9. I Wouldn't go here again.
1 star rating,"This place has really good, but pricy smoothies. Granted the ingredients are fresh and organic, but if you can't get yourself to pay the $7-9 for a smoothie, then take advantage of the $10 for $20 groupon/yelp offer. I bought my offer through yelp and when I went to redeem the yelp offer, they had a problem processing it. 5 minutes later, the owner stepped in and processed the coupon. My beau usually gets the lemon dream. This time he tried the very berry, which was tart, but good. I got the peachy greens, which was really good. After a while it tasted a bit grassy, but still good. I still like the lemon dream the best."
4 star rating,Delicious and fresh.  A little slow first thing in the morning but definitely would return.
4 star rating,"Pros: Awesome menu of smoothies and juices with organic ingredients, they were nice and gave us two samples as we waitedCons: Took FOREVER to make one smoothie--about 10 minutes (I came on a weekend), extremely expensive ($8), and the one I ordered--Incredible Hulk--was supposed to have avocado and honey. They didn't put those in and put dates in instead. I think they should put in the smoothie exactly what the menu says."

5 star rating,"Wife and Daughter recommended Go Smoothie.  Got there just past closing Saturday, but they still let us in and we had good conversation and a great Mango Smoothie.  Will be going back to experience other Smoothies and will recommend to friends."
5 star rating,"Stopped in while visiting Detroit, smoothie was all natural and tasted fantastic and top of the line service/ownership- definitely recommend for a healthy and delicious experience!"
5 star rating,"i am an LA native (read: land of green juice) and arrived in downtown detroit last night for a week of work. my first trip to michigan or the midwest!  a quick google search brought up this place and a quick 5 minute walk from my hotel later i was sipping on one of the most delicious green smoothies i have had in a long time!! i LOVE that Go! does not use processed milks, and that they add healthy fat in the form of avocado (as a Southern California girl i love my avo!) also, nothing is overly sweet, its all natural and nutritious. i loved their clean combos, and that they use lots of ginger, lemon and mint in their drinks. it seems like they have options for everyone from juice novice to die hard green juicer : )great, friendy, fast service, and i also took two juices back to the hotel with me and will be ordering more to get through some very early call times! thanks to this great place for starting my 1st ever trip to detroit off right!"
