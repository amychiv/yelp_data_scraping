4 star rating,The best Jamaican food EVER!!!! The food tasted better than the food I tasted in Jamaica for vacation. Definitely a hidden gem
5 star rating,I called myself going to another Jamaican spot in the area. Never again! This place is great. As of now; don't go look for others.
5 star rating,Very good authentic Jamaican food I love this place and will forever be a happy customer
5 star rating,Absolutely excellent food!! No other Caribbean restaurant compares to this place...hands down. I want married in Jamaica but I'm a Detroit native. Only Jamaican Pot's food reminds me of the best fondest cuisine I had in Jamaica. 1000000 stars    yes million stars
5 star rating,"So I have not been a a long time, so I'm order of making sure that I keep my review up to date I am going to go in the next few weeks and grab some food so that I can give a thorough review.What I do remember is that I do like the Oxtails, but I wasn't so well pleased with the cabbage cause it was a little more crunchy than I enjoy. However I'll be back with an updated review and pics!"
3 star rating,"Delicious food. I had the 3 chicken delight (jerk, bbq and curry) and plantains and was not disappointed."
5 star rating,One of the Detroit's westside finest Jamaica restaurant. From the jerk season to the beef patties this is the bomb.
5 star rating,I can't count how many times I've been here exactly lol but that should tell you how good the food has been in the past. Recently when I've ordered the oxtails they have been very tough and the cabbage slightly undercooked. I hope they can get back to things being more consistent.
3 star rating,"The food is always great! Most of the time I ordered from doordash and I wasn't ever disappointed. It's always hot and absolutely delicious! Next time I go I'll take pictures. The beans and rice is always flavorful, the jerk and bbq chicken are both amazing, spicy and flavorful, and the cabbage is good too!"
5 star rating,Overall amazing food and I had great customer service. We're drove from about 3 hours away and this is the best oxtail I've had since being in Jamaica!! Brown stew chicken was also fire - I inhaled the food before I could get a picture but 10/10 would recommend. I docked 1 star because the large portion of oxtail had the same amount of meat as the small oxtail we ordered

5 star rating,"It's a small carry out spot. A rather high counter top where you order and cash out. Makes for signing the credit card fun. Looks less than appealing on the outside and the inside too. My husband wanted to run for the hills upon getting a sight of the inside. We ordered the triple chicken: jerk, BBQ and curry chicken. It comes with side of rice and peas, plaintains and cabbage. I got an extra side of cabbage. It's not fast food and takes a bit of time, food is prepared fresh to order. Takes about 15-20 minutes.Better and more efficient to have an idea of what you want since it can get crowded in here and there's not a lot of room if the lines long at all. It's been 16 minutes, only order 11 is out. We are order 17. No pagers here, you just have to wait. 22 minutes, no more orders out yet. The woman that has order 14 has been here for almost 30 minutes now. 35 minutes later and order 14 and 15 are out. It's all out of order, it seems. A few minutes later and finally our order was called. We were never told how long our food order might take. Had no inclination it would take so long. My husband was very reluctant to order food from here at all, after seeing the inside store upon entry. He wanted to leave as soon as we crossed the threshold. He said he sensed the kitchen wasn't the cleanest and wasn't certain if he would be eating the food even. The curry chicken wasn't bad, the jerk chicken and the BBQ chicken are better.  They don't give big portions of any of the 3 items. Mostly beans and rice on the bottom, below the meats. The jerk chicken has a bit of kick, it's not bad. It was the better of the three. The cabbage is really bland, regretting the added side of it now. Added Tabasco to give it a bit of flavor. The plaintains are sweet, as expected. The wait here was much longer than expected, even for a nice sit down restaurant, which, this clearly is not. The food overall wasn't bad, the jerk chicken was the best of the triple chicken. The cabbage wasn't worth the money. As long as you are prepared to wait at least an half hour or longer for your food, it's not half bad then."
3 star rating,Overall amazing food and I had great customer service. We're drove from about 3 hours away and this is the best oxtail I've had since being in Jamaica!! Brown stew chicken was also fire - I inhaled the food before I could get a picture but 10/10 would recommend. I docked 1 star because the large portion of oxtail had the same amount of meat as the small oxtail we ordered
4 star rating,"First of all it took well over 30 mins to make a jerk salmon. I initially thought it would be worth the wait based on previous reviews from people who obviously have no clue about Jamaican cuisine.  I should've gotten my clue when the person at the register didn't know anything about a rundown snapper or stew peas. My dish was basically a piece of salmon with jerk sauce from those gallons poured over it. It should've taken them no more than 1 min to create this mess. I've told the young man at the register, NO SWEET PLANTAINS"" There they were at the corner of my plate. I'm all to support small businesses, but I'm not gonna promote nor support mediocre food.  Just call your restaurant ""The Pot"" remove the Jamaican part, it's a disgrace."
1 star rating,"Loved it! I got a small jerk chicken lunch special and had leftovers.  It was perfectly spicy, the plantains were perfectly soft and sweet with some crispy bits and the cabbage was also amazing. Cabbage being amazing says a lot... and they have patties! There was a constant line but we didn't wait long. We sat in the car for maybe 10 minutes (the waiting area is small) then went back in to check and it was ready a few minutes later."
5 star rating,Hole in the wall but omg the food is amazing I can't wait to go back and try a little bit of everything!
5 star rating,"I would highly recommend this restaurant for Jamaican food! I ordered the triple chicken delight in a size medium and pepper steak in a size medium. In the triple chicken delight, I ordered the jerk chicken, brown stew chicken, and bbq chicken. The brown stew chicken was so tender it almost fell apart on my fork (in a good way)! I really liked the flavors of the bbq and jerk chicken but the jerk chicken was my favorite. All the chicken is boneless. The meat is served on top of a bed of rice and beans. It also comes w a side of veggies and plantains. Portion sizes were really large and could be shared by 3 people. Takeout was served hot and it was still warm by the time I got home 30 min later.I would recommend ordering 30min before you intend to pick it up if you order through their website. Plenty of parking in the parking lot to wait for pickup. It gets crowded even for takeout!"
5 star rating,Went there today and the food was perfect.   I got curry chicken and curry goat.   It taste just like I wanted it to.   It was so good I ate the curry chicken driving back east on 8 mile.   Definitely won't be my last time.   Ticket 48.  Lol
5 star rating,"I've been trying different Jamaican restaurants in the past year, and I have to say that The Jamaican Pot ranks one of the top to me so far!  I was thinking to try this place last year.So the other day I was in the area, and decided to place an order:  Small Jerk Chicken dinner.  Everything was really good in my opinion, the chicken had just the right amount of spice, the cabbage was seasoned, and the plantains were also really good!  I also let my friend try the chicken, and he enjoyed it as well.  I will definitely order again from this place whenever  back in the area."
4 star rating,"Ugh this place is so good!!! I still have lots to try but I always, ALWAYS get the beef patty. I want to try the chicken ones but they never have it when I walk in. Maybe if I order takeout ahead of time?Their oxtail is super delicious and I enjoy the rice that comes with it and the slaw and plantain. So delicious! Oxtail is super tender ugh. I think they usually have it done around 3 pm? I call in advance for a later pick up time just in case they run out. I wish I was closer to this place. I need to check when they have curry goat available. They haven't lately"
4 star rating,"Yes ma'am and yassss Sir!!! This food was right on time. My hubby and I only eat seafood and the rest of our food choices are Vegan. When we're out and about checking on our rental properties, the pickings are slim or gross, ya' hear me?So I was elated that there was salmon on the menu. I didn't go inside (my hubby did) so I can't speak to the service. But, Baby, the food was ""goodt""! Portions were small compared to similar servings I'm used to getting in Chicago (miss my other city). But we're going to adjust and be thankful that my city has some decent food options."
5 star rating,"My family and I have been going here for quite some time now & it always hits the spot!! The portions are huge and always leave you with some leftover, and also is well worth it for the great prices they have. Last night I tried the ""Triple Chicken Delight"" which comes with your choice of 3 types of chicken, served over rice & beans, with a side of steamed cabbage and plantains. For my order I picked the Jerk chicken, Curry chicken, & BBQ- All of which were amazing!! I couldn't even pick which one I liked more! Their chickens have a great spice to it too which I'm a huge fan of!! If you like Jamaican or are interested in trying something new I HIGHLY recommend The Jamaican Pot!(Photo was taken after We had already started picking through it)"
5 star rating,"I definitely got transported back in time while trying their food! Every bite brought back so many memories from my childhood in Southern Florida, my dads friend just moving there from Jamaica, his wife cooking us authentic appetizers and dishes. There spices are on a level all their own and they know just how to use them here. As you walk in, it doesn't look like much, and if it's your first time, you might be so inclined to try and sneak out and leave, as I was. You can barely find it hidden in a strip mall. It's extremely small, tight, and sardine packed with people ordering and picking up orders. The smell and my excitement of hopefully finding the real deal kept my feet glued to the floor. And the music. (I REALLY miss the tropical life) My order came up within a reasonable 8 mins. I ordered the triple chicken- opting for the brown stew, curry, and grilled. The others are fantastic also (I believe bbq'd and jerk), and made it almost impossible to pick 3. They let me taste a bite of each one to help me decide. All of their chicken is tender, juicy, and deliciously fresh, no matter which way it's prepared.The brown stew is smooth, comforting, and delicious. Not too spicy. The curry is full of flavor but not too overbearing or too spicy. Just right. And the grilled chicken isn't as simple as it sounds! It's definitely full of special flavors and spices.Underneath the chicken, is a delicious dirty red beans and rice. Simple and delicious, again with its own appropriate seasonings. But the stars of the dish are definitely the plantains and cabbage. I. LOVE. PLANTAINS. AND CABBAGE! (If it's made properly!) My mom loved to fry up some cabbage with some leftover frying oil. It's where all the flavor is! Just a drizzle! And they nailed it! The cabbage still had a nice crunch and was perfectly cooked.And the star... the plantains. Look, heed my advice, order a decent size of plantains if you like them. These are simply ah-mayyyyyy-zingggggggg. I could eat them every day. (Matter of fact, I think I will! I'm gonna have to make them myself though, at home.) Hopefully I can duplicate their flavor. My picky children absolutely loved it as well and begged for more!For $17, you cannot beat the value of this experience. They definitely need to expand to a much larger location, possibly downtown, and have a large seating capacity because they will need it. Customer service was A1 also! Somehow keeping their cool during the mad dinner rush before they closed. I tried to go back in and order more chicken and sides ala carte but they ran out of what I wanted.Way to go guys, you've got a gem here! Keep up the great work! I definitely cannot wait to return! Anyone who knows me KNOWS I don't hand out 5 stars easily, but this was a no brainer for me:)"
5 star rating,"Traditionally this was my go-to spot when I wanted my Jamaican or Caribbean fix. However, with the emergence of other similar restaurants in the area I've had to do a lot of comparing with places I've eaten at recently. Now don't get me wrong I still love this restaurant, but I'm beginning to realize that it's not the same quality I remember. Not sure if there's been a change in ownership or recipes, but the food just doesn't taste the same, and items that I used to get are either not on the menu anymore or limited in availability (the festival and saltfish, respectively). One item worth noting is the jerk chicken, which is okay but its far from the best you'll have in the metro Detroit area. Increased competition is definitely a factor, but that's not a bad thing for the average consumer."
4 star rating,"I used to live in St. Kitts while attending school there. In those 3 years I learned to love Caribbean food. When I finally returned home, I was amazed to discover that Detroit has a handful of Jamaican restaurants that serve the kind of food I would end up missing so dearly. I have tried as many of them as I could and multiple times at that. But in conclusion I have to say Jamaican Pot is by far the best you're gonna find. Their menu includes all the traditional Caribbean staples and the portion sizes are tremendous. But what keeps me coming here and not other places similar to them is consistency. If there is only one thing negative I have to say its that they don't do fried dumplings (or Johnnycakes as the Kittitians would call it). Some of my fondest memories were of eating saltfish and Johnnycakes with a nice cold Ting :)"
5 star rating,"This place is the absolute TRUTH!! GREAT FOOD all around as in you cannot get anything bad here. Ox tail is fire! Think hearty beef stew like short ribs. The goat is awesome it falls apart off the fork. The jerk chicken is TRUTH, such flavor. Oh yeah rice and peas, cabbage and bomb ass plantains. GET EXTRAS"
5 star rating,"Sooo good.  I ordered a beef patty, plantains, coco bread, and fruit punch, and absolutely loved every single thing I had!  My friend got the jerk chicken, which I grabbed a bite of and was also good.  I'm so bummed I didn't know about this place when I lived nearby, but I will definitely be back when I'm in the area!"
5 star rating,My food was pretty good. I really enjoyed all of it. The cabbage is a little crunch and has great flavor. I got curry and jerk chicken. The service was good as well. The wait was shorter than expected.I've had them several times before and the food is always good. This was my 1st time to their store front location.
5 star rating,"I was skeptical at first but after trying the fried plantains I was hooked. I like the jerk chicken. I also tried the curry chicken. It was ok, but wouldn't get it again a little to bland for me. I've tried several time to order the meat pies but they are always sold out. I will continue to seek them out. One thing I know is when a restaurant can't keep a item on the menu - that's the thing to try. Wish me luck ."
4 star rating,While Caribbean food is not my first choice I enjoy trying other cuisines.  The food was hot decent spice but the rice was over cooked and just didn't do it for me my wife and little guy.  Sad because I have been to Jamaica and the Caribbean islands and this taste nothing like those countries.  Will say the jerk chicken was ok but the oxtail. OMG. Thank you for the 4 broken bone with a sliver of meat.  Combo for $18. Ahh no thanks.  There were actually people inside waiting for their food smoking weed.  F in unbelievable.
4 star rating,"First impression, but quite good.  I tried the sauce for the curry goat first, and while it was good, it wasn't what I was wanting last night...I had a taste for jerk chicken.Very not bad.  It's not the best I've ever had, but it was a very respectable version of jerk chicken, and the cabbage and plantains were terrific!  The peas and rice was good, too, and was served underneath the very plentiful amount of chicken.The sauce on the chicken was a bit sweeter of a jerk sauce than I've had in the past, but still good, and the spice level was a spot-on medium like I'd asked for.  The medium container size was *plenty* for one person for one meal, and if I hadn't arrived absolutely famished, I would have had some left over.  Portion size was certainly fair, and quality was nice.If there's one thing I would complain about, it's the estimated time for food preparation:  while they do ask you to be patient (which is very fair), I was told 15 minutes for my food to be ready.  25 minutes later, the food still wasn't ready, and I was getting grouchy about it.  Better to tell me 30 minutes and deliver on time than to tell me 15 minutes and have me wondering what's going on for the last 15 minutes.The only other complaint would be that the bottled water wasn't cold enough.  Other than that?  Good experience all around.  I ate at one of the tables inside (6 whole seats!), and that was fine for me.Nice to have this place at arm's length for the future."
4 star rating,"I made my order online and selected the time that I wanted to pick up my order. I was pleasantly surprised that the order was ready and waiting for me when I arrived at the restaurant. It was easy and seamless. The reason for the three stars is because I didn't love the food. I've had jerk chicken from many different places and it just didn't meet the usual standards. The chicken wasn't jerked, it was more in a sauce and lacked the flavor I was expecting."
3 star rating,"Came here with some friends as a recommendation for jamaican food. After viewing the tiny menu underneath the counter to order, we ordered some ox tails and shrimp entrees,  beef patties, and jerk chicken. We did have to wait for some time for our food, but that was expected for the food is MADE TO ORDER. The beef patties are okay. I prefer spicey beef patties. The oxtails, red beans and rice, and cabbage were delicious. The jerk chicken was great!!!! Best dish of them all ! The Cons: The shrimp on the skewer were over cooked. And the oxtails were smaller than I'm used to. Overall, I'll be back for the jerk chicken FOR SURE!"
4 star rating,"First stopping by was yesterday.  DoorDash is not working on the website or on the app so I ended up just taking the drive. When I walked in establishment was very small inside, all the patties in the warmer were sold and the ones being cooked were sold. The jerk chicken was actually little pieces of boneless chicken breast not grilled at all more like bbq chicken with spice. Little to no stew cabbage and it was watery just okay, (I did read a sign while waiting that said check your food before leaving).  It was just okay for me didn't enjoy the jerk chicken"
3 star rating,Omg I'm stuffed they food is so good this large triple chicken will get you together I'm not go hold you.
5 star rating,"First timer!! The food was delicious!!! The chicken was seasoned well & cooked to perfection. It's served on top of rice and beans which were very good. The cabbage still had a crunch to it. It was a refreshing side to the meal. (I wish it would have been a little bit more for the price). The plantains weren't too sweet, but just right. I chose the option where you pick two meats. It was around $18 or so. We ordered online. However, my cousin ordered as well. Unfortunately, they cancelled her order and we were none the wiser. She never received a message or anything. We sent my niece to pick it up & after her wait, she found out that they cancelled HER ENTIRE ORDER. That was my only issue. I wish something would have been in place for them to have her choose another option or, the shrimp not be an option at all. They ended up allowing my niece to order food there, so that was a plus. I'll order from them again, just not online."
4 star rating,Very nasty the chicken is covered in this ver spicy nasty sauce not Authentic at all .
1 star rating,"Just recently enjoyed a lunch special of the Jerk Chicken, ohh boy it was alright! Driven by this place a thousand times and finally decided to give it a try on a coworkers recommendation. Everything was up to par. I really enjoyed it. I will have to be a little brave and try something different next time!"
4 star rating,"Nice friendly, family vibe on first visit.Other jamaican/jerk spots could learn from the excellent boneless option.Great gravy/sauce."
5 star rating,"Call ahead! All food made to order, so if you don't be prepared to wait.  I waited 20 minutes, but didn't mind that day.I ordered the Jerk Chicken Large Lunch deal, spicy, and it came with a plantains, beans & rice (they call beans, peas!),  and a hot cabbage salad.  I also ordered a beef patty, a chicken curry patty, 2 Coco breads, and a  small rum cake.  This was more than enough to fill 2 people.  The Jerk Chicken was to die for!  It was spicy, and I usually like Thai food at a medium + level, and that is what I equate the spicy Jerk chicken to.  Very flavorful, and delicious.The plantains were good, not too sweet, starchy, or greasy.  The cabbage side was warm cabbage salad with a touche of acidity to it, and it went perfect with the Jerk chicken.The Patties I ordered just had meat in them, no vegetables, but were quite tasty.  I think I liked the beef over the chicken curry better.The Coco bread was a huge, soft, yeasty bun, that was a pleasure to eat.  A tad sweet, but I really dug how soft & spongy the bread was.The only item I didn't much care for was the rum cake.  It literally tasted like you were chewing dark rum.  There wasn't any sweetness to it at all, and after having spicy food, I love washing it down with something sweet.  Good thing the rest of the food was phe-nom!"
4 star rating,get the oxtails and change your life for the good !!! the flavor is amazing and i felt safe going in during this pandemic!!!
5 star rating,Omg I'm stuffed they food is so good this large triple chicken will get you together I'm not go hold you.
5 star rating,"I used to like this place but, the last time I ordered and today I was very disappointed! Doordash and their system connected to them sucks! Doordash had my order in their system but The Jamaican Pot did not! I'm done with both of them!"
1 star rating,"Very small potions for the money, use to be worth the ride not so much anymore. They put the chicken over the rice and peas to mask the amount."
3 star rating,"I would have given them 4 stars because the food was decent but the service wasn't that great. I ordered online which ended up being through something called Chow Now (which I did not know initially). When I arrived at 1:10pm to pickup my food, that should have been ready per my email at 12:58pm, I was told 'about 8 more minutes.' I waited in my car and in 8 min it was ready. The bag was double tied and the young lady was pleasant. I get home (10 min drive) and my Rum Cake (I was longing for) was not in the bag instead they gave me black cake (something I didn't order). I attempted to call them from 1:45pm until present (2:55pm) and no one has answered. So there's no way to get a replacement or get a refund. Don't order through these apps it's very hard to get your money back. Disappointing because I am trying to support BLACK-OWNED."
2 star rating,"Wow such horrible service. Ordered and paid online @3:36 said meal would be ready in 30 mins.  I went inside at 4:05 and waited in line.  By time I got up my order was not ready and lady at counter didn't know how long and couldn't find order name.  20 mins later again I asked about it and she said yes the order is being made.  Many other people were upset and requested refunds bc taking forever and the lady is rude.  At least 2 other people who put in their order after I arrived to pick it up got their order completed before me and I ordered 30 minutes before I arrived. My order 2 jerk chicken dishes, a couple of side and a dessert.  All from their main popular items.  Other people were realizing it too that they were walk in orders long after immune and they got their meals.  At 4:40 I asked them to give my meal to the elderly (probably homeless) man who asked for some money for food and I left. I won't give them a 2nd chance."

1 star rating,"Loved the jerk chicken and plantains, big fan of Jamaican food! This location is close to my house and service was fast and the people working their were very friendly."
4 star rating,"I have tried mostly everything on their menu and have not encountered a bad meal at all. My favorite is the jerk salmon and jerk chicken. The spices that are used to marinate the proteins are one of a kind. The rice and beans are good with a touch of heat and pairs well with the crispy cool amount of cabbage.  Also, the Jamaican patties are good. I recommend calling in your order as they are busy and don't be disappointed if they may run out of the protein you want because it's happened to me before.One of my favorite places in Detroit!"
4 star rating,This food is so good and so seasoned I could cry. Exactly what I would be expecting from Jamaican food!!!!!! I will definitely be back. The jerk chicken is so perfectly seasoned and ouch. I am in complete heaven! I can not wait to go out my way to frequent this place. Who needs Jamaica when you you've got this place!!!! Literally going back in the morning :)
5 star rating,"While out of town on a work trip, I wanted to order some delivery to avoid venturing out into a city I was unfamiliar with. Of course, I looked to yelp for some decent suggestions and stumbled across the Jamaican Pot. I ordered the medium jerk chicken and a beef patty. not sure if medium referred to spice or size, both were decent though. While waiting for my order to be delivered I read more reviews on the food - more on that in a bit. My order arrived promptly and I was impressed by how the food looked. I did notice my beef patty was missing which was unfortunate. I quickly called the restaurant to inquire about it and no one answered. I called again and was put on hold. When I did speak with someone and told them of the issue, they mentioned that they thought they put one in the bag. The young woman offered my beef patty and another item on the house if I chose to come to the restaurant but understood that would be counterintuitive seeing as though I ordered delivery in the first place. I was also from out of town so I wouldn't have the opportunity to redeem that offer anytime soon. She informed me that I could request a refund through grub hub but the restaurant couldn't provide one since the order was completed. I opted to try and get a refund through grub hub but found that to be a difficult process so I guess I just have to eat the cost of not receiving my beef patty.The food I did receive was good. Not the best Jamaican food I've ever had, but not the worst either. It was decent. In the reviews I read, many people think the jerk chicken tastes like Barbeque chicken and I can see where they get that. I've had jerk chicken that tastes similar to this with the Barbeque flavor and I've come to the realization that I'm not a fan of this type of jerk. There are different ways to do jerk and this just isn't my favorite. The plantains, rice and cabbage were all good though. Overall, this was okay food and I don't think my money wasted terribly wasted, aside from the missing beef patty."
2 star rating,"I'm so upset about my food. I ordered Pepper steak and they gave me shredded steak that looks like dog food and I'm not kidding !!! I'm so upset because my boyfriend went 30 mins to get my food for it to come back looking like this. If I was there I would have not paid for this !!! I'm so upset if your looking for GOOD, Jamaican food go to Caribbean Citchen on 7 mile this place is a NO GO. Coming straight from a real Jamaican this place is not it ! Very disappointed."
1 star rating,"Great food here! We got the jerk chicken and curried goat. Both were very flavorful and had rice and beans, sweet plantains, and cabbage included. Lots of food for a good deal."
5 star rating,Food was great! I order and paid ahead but they didn't check and started my order 30 later when i arrived. Lol
5 star rating,The food here reminds me of the food at the wild boar in Chicago. It's authentic and exceptionally delicious! I'd honestly eat it everyday if my waistline allowed it! Decently priced and good portions. I love the fried plantains!
4 star rating,"I really enjoy this place. The flavor of the jerk chicken taste beautiful with just the right and a spice. All of the flavors of everything on the plate mend together really well. We were really upset when we got home to find out that are plates didn't have the plantains in them, but there's not many options for Jamaican food in the area so I'm not going to bash them because I want to see local businesses in the community thrive. We also had the peach cobbler which was kind of unique had a little hint of something I couldn't quite put my finger on but was a mid-level meh, but I would ordered again if that makes any sense. All in all I really enjoy the combination of flavors, and this is one of my wife's favorite places so we'll be back. It would have been a five-star review if the plantains were included in our plate but, four star review."
4 star rating,So much flavour ! Longer waits but worth it. Awesome portion sizes and they have lunch specials during the week.
5 star rating,"The food was amazing but they forgot our party's and gave us the incorrect order size. Because of the mix up , they gave us a new dish because of the mix up. Highly recommend this place."
5 star rating,The food was amazing but they forgot our party's and gave us the incorrect order size. If everything was in order I would have given them a 5.
4 star rating,"Me and my husband used to eat here often. My husband used to swear by this place. Today, I called to place an order for pickup. The woman answered only said ""Jamaican Pot"" and LITERALLY waited for me to continue and/or place my order without any assistance from a person who answers the phone (ie, ""would that complete your order?"", other courteous banter, etc.) . I then asked about patties and she was very vague saying that ""some should ready in 30-40 mins"" and I had to ask which kind would be ready and she begrudgingly answered, ""beef"". They almost never have chicken patties, btw (which are divine when fresh and hot). One time long ago, my husband mentioned they had veggie patties but I've never seen any.When we get there, I immediately wondered why the phone order taker DID NOT communicate to me that they were only taking CASH. For the past two days (21st-23rd per the printed sign), they had been taking cash due to some irrelevant reason explained and the person I placed my order with somehow.....FORGOT?!!!The closest ATM was almost 10 mins and only 2 miles away however, we were there 10 minutes before we realized that we could get money from The Federal Reserve faster.Not only has the quality of the food have steadily declined (cabbage is highly inconsistent; sometimes tender, sometimes crunchy; they've failed to fulfill my husband's request for spicy jerk before; portion size has been skimp for at least two of our meals before, etc.) and I've had issues with their customer service before but NOW, I am totally done. My time was wasted for the last time. My appetite was played with for the last time."
4 star rating,"Ok,, so if you haven't had proper Jamaican food before, this spot is probably the best place for you to get your feet wet. Yummy, spicy and savory all in the same time. Jamaican food is probably the best type of Caribbean food as far as I'm concerned. This place right here, is definitely the best place to get it.Growing up in New Jersey, my mother would come home from work at the hospital with some good home cooked Jamaican food from her other nurse friends. This is when I had my first taste of Jamaican patties. Ever since I became a transplant here in Michigan, I have been searching for that certain beef patty. The one that at first bite, will take me back in time when I had my first ever authentic Jamaican beef patties. If you're not used to spicy food, these guys will burn the crap out of your mouth, but trust me, you'll keep eating them because they are that good. The ones that are sold here are by far the best I've had in Michigan.But don't just stop at the patties,, that's just appetizer my friend. Get yourself a some jerk chicken meal my friend. The whole set comes with beans and rice, cabbage and fried bananas. A full ensemble of pure Jamaican goodness all in one styro platter. They make their jerk chicken here extremely good. The meat is juicy, tender and packed with that Jamaican jerk seasoning. You would probably laugh at all other American jerk flavored chicken after you've had whatever that's being served here.Yes it's around the 8mile and Southfield area, there is no denying that this particular spot is in the hood. We still showed up, we came out of our car, entered the establishment, ordered food, waited, took our food, walked back to our car and left. Not even for one single second did we feel like we were in danger. No bullet holes, no gun shots, no drive-by shootings..... You know what?? I'm just glad there's no snooty suburbanites around to ruin my day,,, and for that, I thank you.Life is so much better when you have some real good delicious Jamaican food. And trust me,,, I shall return. Specially for that curry goat and them ox tails."
5 star rating,"Oxtails all fatty. Nice customer service but did a absolutely  poor job in resolving the issue. Literally left the food with them, and I paid. Driving an hour to get, total waste.In regards to hygiene there's a sign saying masks are required but the employees themselves aren't even wearing masks... while making the food! I've been here multiple times over the past two weeks trying out the food, this will be my last."
1 star rating,"Wasn't expecting much after reading the recent reviews. But my BF placed an order early lunch time on his way home around 11. The wait for the food took a while longer than expected as they had just opened. If you want oxtail, it takes a while. So either place the order way ahead of time or be prepared to wait. But good food takes time ;) The food made the 45 min drive to Ann Arbor & it was totally worth it! We ended up getting the goat curry, jerk chicken, and beef patties. The entrees came with fried plantains, rice & peas, and cabbage. The goat was super tender and well flavored -- could've used a bit more heat imo. The jerk chicken was amazing - great flavor, heat, smoke, and tender...this was my favorite. I do wish they gave a little more plantains but I'll get extra next time. The beef patties were nice and flaky but a little bland. I'd definitely recommend this spot when you're in the mood for some Jamaican food. Just wish it wasn't so far from me!"
4 star rating,"After reading reviews, decided to give this place a try. Was totally unsatisfied with the food.  The rice taste parboiled, the ox tails were cut really thin and spread out to appear as a generous portion. Not much flavor to the beans and rice or ox tails. Have had much better Jamaican food."
2 star rating,As much as I wanna support black businesses these guys NEVER answer the phone.  They are NEVER open from the hours they say they are.  They missed out on so much money from me including a Xmas holiday party all because they aren't consistent and don't answer the phone.
1 star rating,"Came here at the recommendation of a friend i met last week who thought I'd find the curry here was better than my favorite spot. They were wrong lol! Food was good here, I mean I ate it all in one sitting (not that i got a whole lot anyway), but i think I'm gonna stick with my usual jamaican spot a couple miles down the road though. Prices are a little bit higher and the food here wasnt as good. I know they have a lunch special for 8 or 9 bucks but i got there right after and ended up paying over 16 dollars for some goat curry. Had a little spice, well seasoned with some earthy flavors going on, but i had to take it home and add some red pepper and hot sauce to get some heat and flavor jumping. If I drove right by it for some reason and was hungry i might stop by again, not going out of my way though. They are cleaner inside than my normal spot but as i always say, the dirtiest places always have the best food!!"
3 star rating,"I am a happier man this morning.  I did not know that Jamaican Pot relocated from Applegate Plaza to Eight Mile.  I mistakenly assumed that the business had closed.I ordered the large, spicy Jerk Chicken.  The portion of chicken is generous enough for two and includes rice & beans (for two), a very small side of plantains (skimpy for one) and sliced cabbage (portion for one).  In a word:  HeavenI ordered a (extra) side of plantains - Yum.  It is a reasonable portion.  I also ordered a side of cornbread - one 3""x3"" square.  It has a faint tease of sweetness - very good tasting, but for $1, not an especially good value.The new location is essentially a carry-out storefront located in a new-ish strip mall on the eastbound lanes of Eight Mile Road.  There are three 2-top tables, generally occupied by folks waiting for their carrThe counter is insanely high ... and I'm 6'1"".  It is chin level on me.No WiFi.CC accepted.CCW allowed."
5 star rating,"For my birthday week my husband and I tried out restaurants that we've never been to. Yesterday was The Jamaican Pot on 8 Mile. So so so good! We had curried , oxtail, rice and peas, cabbage, and plantains. And to drank, a cold Ting. Highly recommend!!! We went straight after work, and there were a lot of people who also had the same idea. We just missed the meat patties, which means we have to go back! The oxtail was nice and spicy, The goat curry was really great, and a slight crunch of the cabbage went beautifully with both.#puremichigan #tastingtable #eeeeeats #detroit #localeats #nomnomnom #ilovefood #jamaicanfood #bareaders"
5 star rating,"Very small potions for the money, use to be worth the ride not so much anymore. They put the chicken over the rice and peas to mask the amount."
3 star rating,Food is always delicious. Love the Beef Patty. Enjoyed curry chicken with rice. Just wish the portions sizes were a somewhat larger.
4 star rating,I stopped to see if they had oxtails(this is not my first time there). They never cook enough oxtails. The staff said they would be ready in an hour. It was 7:10 pm at the time. So I placed an order. An hour & 10 minutes went by. Someone came out and said the oxtails weren't done yet and needed 20 more minutes. I figured I had already waited over an hour.They were finally ready about 8:45 pm. I got home and my medium order had 4 little oxtails that were bland as hell! The cabbage wasn't done. I'll never come back to Jamaican Pot. Looking for a new Jamaican restaurant!
3 star rating,I came to get the oxtails at 4:45 pm and they were out! No Coco bread either! The cabbage wasn't done either. Someone's not taking care of business. This looks bad since it's my first time here. Maybe my last!!
3 star rating,"Awesome little carry out.  The jerk chicken is great.  Nice smoky BBQ taste with that Jamaican heat.  I had mild,  but would probably kick it up next time...  The cabbage side and plantains were delicious.  I had the small serving and though I'm full...  I will be getting the medium or large.. Lol.. Very good!"
4 star rating,First time trying Jamaican food and I think I picked the right place! Food was delicious and fresh. The chicken was juicy and tender. Not really a fan of plantines but I ate them anyway. Small plate is more then enough for a good lunch portion and it's a reasonable price. It's even good cold lol
5 star rating,"This restaurant sits on the edge of Southfield (but is considered Detroit). Carryout type of place - just chairs and 1 table is you really want to sit here though.Paying for my food was a little tricky. I'm just under 5ft, and the counter is at 5ft haha. The lady behind the counter was sweet too; called me Bite-sized ;)Got the Curry chicken and jerk/bbq? chicken (I actually ordered a jerk shrimp and didn't check till I got home, -1 star). Tasted good regardless, but not what I ordered. They wrap the Togo boxes and give you silverware too. Paid ~$23.You pick your spicy level. (Got hot and it wasn't that spicy for reference). My favorites were the plantains and cabbage sides that come for free with the entree. The plantains were not dripping in grease (THANK YOU!). I'm willing to try them again, but I'll open and check my order before walking out.P.S. check out the song on their website. It's pretty sick ;)"
4 star rating,"We went as a group to this place, I didn't know, but it's HALAL!! How awesome is that! Ordered Jerk Chicken, well worth it! Spicy and friend banana lol loved it"
5 star rating,Very good food. Staff is very polite and professional. Will offer samples for you to try. Prices are very reasonable.
5 star rating,"Decided to check out ""The Jamaican Pot"" and it was amazing! Had the Jerk Chicken (medium), Rice & Peas, Plantains, Cabbage and a Beef Patty. The Jerk Chicken was marinated and cooked to perfection and I'm not a huge fan of Cabbage but theirs was delicious! The Beef Patty could have had a little more flavor/kick to it but was still very good! Overall great Jamaican food!"
4 star rating,"I used to like this place but, the last time I ordered and today I was very disappointed! Doordash and their system connected to them sucks! Doordash had my order in their system but The Jamaican Pot did not! I'm done with both of them!"
1 star rating,"I would have given them 4 stars because the food was decent but the service wasn't that great. I ordered online which ended up being through something called Chow Now (which I did not know initially). When I arrived at 1:10pm to pickup my food, that should have been ready per my email at 12:58pm, I was told 'about 8 more minutes.' I waited in my car and in 8 min it was ready. The bag was double tied and the young lady was pleasant. I get home (10 min drive) and my Rum Cake (I was longing for) was not in the bag instead they gave me black cake (something I didn't order). I attempted to call them from 1:45pm until present (2:55pm) and no one has answered. So there's no way to get a replacement or get a refund. Don't order through these apps it's very hard to get your money back. Disappointing because I am trying to support BLACK-OWNED."
2 star rating,"Well....it hurts me to post only a 3 star review, but out of the 3 meat combo plate I ordered, only 1 was good. I could've passed on the browned stewed and curry chicken, both were very bland. My favorite of the 3 was the jerk chicken. I personally appreciated how they cut up the chicken and its ready to eat, vs having it on the bone and you having to take it off. The veggies, rice and beef patty were good though, but because Ive had better, only 3 from me."
4 star rating,Different twist on the jerk chicken. It's chopped  chicken over rice. It's absolutely delicious. Be careful. Medium is hot. Hot is stupid hot imho!
5 star rating,"Loved the jerk chicken and plantains, big fan of Jamaican food! This location is close to my house and service was fast and the people working their were very friendly."
5 star rating,"So glad I can get this delivered now since I don't drive home on 8 mile anymore.  Great Jamaican food, note of caution is that the mild jerk chicken is almost too hot for me and I usually go Medium at Indian and Thai places, so beware of the spice, but the fixin's are fab."
4 star rating,Ordered the Jamaican Pot and it was okay.... I think I should of got mild spice on the jerk chicken. It was super spicy for me. I would try it again with mild spice. The plantains were really good and also the cabbage was excellent.
3 star rating,"By far, the best Jamaican spot in town! Fresh oxtail, red snapper, they have it all. Fast. Family owned. Well priced. The jerk chicken is simply AMAZING, seasoned perfect. The meal is the way to go- comes with rice & peas, plantain, and cabbage. I found medium spice to be quite spicy but perfect for me. Their meat is halal too. They have a pretty small dine-in, best to go with carry-out. I need to go back and try their curry chicken!"
5 star rating,"They have gotten much better with customer service over the past year. I had multiple bad experiences and swore off going back to The Jamaican Pot, but after trying several other places I came back. It is something about their diced chicken that I enjoy over traditional Jamaican jerk chicken spots. BBQ chicken is a family favorite and thankfully they removed the employee that was horrible with service and replaced her with more pleasant, attentive staff."
4 star rating,"Food was okay, not as good as I expected, rice was dente and oxtail didn't have enough seasoning, I was disappointed"
2 star rating,"My mom and I Placed a catering order about 10 days ago. Paid 90% of the balance thinking we were being proactive (LESSON LEARNED)  Went in yesterday to pick it up and not only was it not ready... the staff appeared to not even be familiar with a catering order having even been placed. After going back and forth for however long, and realizing that the order had been printed out and posted on the bulletin board  and that they had just not bothered to look at it / ""nobody told them about it""..........  they were able to readily provide the order of sides, but the chicken order had to be cooked fresh. My mom ended up spending 40+ minutes at this place, from start to finish, causing her to be late to my bridal shower trying to pick up the order that should have been waiting on her arrival. Their means of compensation was 6 small containers of desserts and her not having to pay the $20 balance left on the bill.................. Completely unsatisfied with that. And because she was late to my bridal shower she decided to not go back and forth about  refunds or any better compensation. Understandable but that kind of business (not ENTIRELY the mishap but their lack of making up for it) is unacceptable as an establishment. Of course accidents happen, but when they do, its their responsibility as a business to make it right in the end for their customers, ESPECIALLY when the issue is 100%, without a doubt and did I mention completely THEIR FAULT!The food was enjoyable but that experience completely ruined it for me. I  wont be back. But I will continue sharing with my guests what the issue was with the food."
1 star rating,"I woke up this morning late and lazy, wanting to eat something spicy and delicious: something that would go well with a glass of chill coconut water/ beer and with house of cards. I did a medium jerk chicken take out. The preparation time is around 20-25 mins ( I got there in 15 mins but had to wait for my food to come). Food is top notch. Authentic, well cooked and delicious. I have eaten off the lunch boxes of my colleagues with a truly jamaican background and this is as close as it gets. The ambience and music add to the aroma manifolds. The side of plaintains is to die for!! Jerk chicken 5star. Next on list is goat curry :)- can't wait to try and review."
5 star rating,"Being from the islands I'm a tough critic when it comes to Jerk Chicken. This being called jerk chicken is a joke. It's a sweet BBQ at best, not at all what jerk chicken should be. The chicken is cut diced, not how I like to enjoy jerk. You want the meat to have the juices cooked inside you need full pieces man, this needs to change. The spice is not a Caribbean spice either much work needed with this dish. The oxtails are the complete opposite of the jerk chicken, absolutely AMAZING! The meat was tender falling off the bone. Nice strong flavors especially being compared to the jerk. I wish there were betters portions of meat when ordering the combo especially since the flavor is just sub par. There's more rice in this dish than anything for the price. The red pea soup seemed to have chicken and less red peas. This was very confusing. Too much water in the soup needs to be thicker. Disappointed nothing on the menu for desserts or beverages were available. Especially being on a Saturday at 1pm.  All in all I'm not sure if actual Jamaicans run this place or Americans with a lot of hope.  I would try other restaurants when it comes to Caribbean unless you want a beef pattie or oxtails. Hope this review helps!"
4 star rating,Great food just gotta get a better ordering system sometimes u call won't get and answer or get the answering machine then hung up on..... Jerk chicken is the King
4 star rating,First time trying Jamaican food and I think I picked the right place! Food was delicious and fresh. The chicken was juicy and tender. Not really a fan of plantines but I ate them anyway. Small plate is more then enough for a good lunch portion and it's a reasonable price. It's even good cold lol
5 star rating,"Usually when I want some jerk chicken, I go to Jamaican Fenton's. Didn't feel like making that commute today so I tried out the Jamaican Pot. I got the extra spicy jerk chicken, and man when I say the spice hit me hard, I am not exaggerating. The chicken was very moist, rice was flavorful, and then plantains were sweet and soft. 5 stars hands down. Prior to going, I checked other reviews and it was advised to order at least 30 minutes in advance which worked perfectly."
5 star rating,Great food i love the bbq chicken with double cabbage sooo good! Always good food and good service i would call in a head of time to pick up food the wait could be a little long but it's worth it!
5 star rating,"We went as a group to this place, I didn't know, but it's HALAL!! How awesome is that! Ordered Jerk Chicken, well worth it! Spicy and friend banana lol loved it"
5 star rating,This is my favorite Caribbean spot! Order anything on the menu and you will love it! I have never been disappointed with anything I've ordered!
5 star rating,"I've been here twice and both times they have shown love. The food is amazing and packed with flavor, the 3 things I've had over my 2 trips are Oxtails, jerk chicken, jerk shrimp, and I was completely satisfied with the different proteins they offered. This is one of the most legit Jamaican restaurants I've been too and I will continue to come when I come back to Detroit."
5 star rating,"Just recently enjoyed a lunch special of the Jerk Chicken, ohh boy it was alright! Driven by this place a thousand times and finally decided to give it a try on a coworkers recommendation. Everything was up to par. I really enjoyed it. I will have to be a little brave and try something different next time!"
4 star rating,"I've been trying different Jamaican restaurants in the past year, and I have to say that The Jamaican Pot ranks one of the top to me so far!  I was thinking to try this place last year.So the other day I was in the area, and decided to place an order:  Small Jerk Chicken dinner.  Everything was really good in my opinion, the chicken had just the right amount of spice, the cabbage was seasoned, and the plantains were also really good!  I also let my friend try the chicken, and he enjoyed it as well.  I will definitely order again from this place whenever  back in the area."
5 star rating,The Jamaican Pot has THEE BEST food. Most authentic Jamaican food in Detroit. I just wish they would get more than one phone line. It's so hard to get through to even make an order. Hope they consider it
4 star rating,I loved this place and the owners are genuinely kind.  I've never had any bad experience going there and it's good every time
5 star rating,"Wow such horrible service. Ordered and paid online @3:36 said meal would be ready in 30 mins.  I went inside at 4:05 and waited in line.  By time I got up my order was not ready and lady at counter didn't know how long and couldn't find order name.  20 mins later again I asked about it and she said yes the order is being made.  Many other people were upset and requested refunds bc taking forever and the lady is rude.  At least 2 other people who put in their order after I arrived to pick it up got their order completed before me and I ordered 30 minutes before I arrived. My order 2 jerk chicken dishes, a couple of side and a dessert.  All from their main popular items.  Other people were realizing it too that they were walk in orders long after immune and they got their meals.  At 4:40 I asked them to give my meal to the elderly (probably homeless) man who asked for some money for food and I left. I won't give them a 2nd chance."
1 star rating,I only got plantains but they were good. Place was crowded when I arrived but didn't take long to get order. I'd go back.
5 star rating,"Best Jerk chicken I've ever had and the patties are out of this world! Oh, and don't forget the carrot cake! Mmmmmm! The staff was friendly and helpful too!"
5 star rating,"I have never had Jamaican food apart from this once at Bahama Breeze which did not feel or taste authentic (it was very ""chain""y)I decided to go local this time, searched in yelp and found this place Jamaican Pot. Got an Ox-Tail Stew, Large, Spicy.Quantity: you need to be very hungry to finish it.Quality: DIVINE. Great texture, perfectly cooked and spiced.The side of plaintains itself was worth the 25min drive. I just wish they had  more plantains in the side serving especially when the dish is almost $15. The plantains are so good, its annoying that they are so less.The cabbage salad it comes with it was decent and spicy.Great, friendly, smiling staff.I'll be back for the Bob Marley Stew (yes you read that right!) and the Cow Foot Stew. I'll order an extra side of plantains though."
5 star rating,The Patties are the best!! Make sure to order more than one!! The triple chicken is the best way to go!! The cobbler is soooo good too!! Thank you!!
5 star rating,First time eating here and I'm so glad I ordered small portion of jerk chicken. The chicken was tender and moist. The rice and cabbage was cooked perfect for it to still taste great by the time I got back on east side of Detroit. The beef patty were also good. I will return again
4 star rating,"Try the jerk chicken very tasty and just the right amount of spice. Don't try to eat in your car, this requires a seat at the table with a cold ginger beer. Fast service with friendly staff.  stop here for taste of Jamaica"
4 star rating,"I've eaten here twice.   Both times I ordered medium ox tails and it comes with rice and peas, cabbage and plantains.  During my first experience,  I thought my food was seasoned a s cooked well (although the ox tails weren't meaty). So naturally I wanted to try this place again.  The second time, I ordered a medium ox tail dinner again with the same sides. The oxtails were still small but this time around my  cabbage and plantains were really undercooked. I mean they may as well have served them raw. My friend ordered the jerk chicken but requested the jerk sauce on side (he's Jamaican and doesn't prefer a wet jerk sauce). The jerk chicken without the sauce (per the chef has jerk seasoning) just tasted like bbq chicken."
3 star rating,"Coworkers recommend this place to us. Wow. We had the Jerk and BBQ chicken. I was apprehensive on the BBQ but was very happy that there wasn't gobs of sauce. The Jerk is pretty spicy, even mild. The cabbage was surprisingly good. Oh, and the plantains were AMAZING! I could eat a plate of those alone.They were slammed so we waited a while. We learned nothing is canned or processed, it's all fresh. The desserts and waters are supplied by local entrepreneur vendors.They even gave us a free dessert for the long wait. It's a kind and gracious family run business."
4 star rating,Tasty Jamaican food with a relatively short wait time.  Go ahead and call it in so you can grab and go- if you've been to Jamaica you already know the menu.   Jerk is the sweeter kind.  Patties are less greasy than most.  Plantains are delish.
4 star rating,"Had a mini lunch size jerk chicken, when I tell u I wish I had order a large! The regret is real! So tasty I nearly liked the carry out box clean lol. I asked for a sample of the bean soup.... bomb. Com I will be back for a full portion as soon as my next work day. Trust and believe in this quality food"
4 star rating,"The good:  the food is very delicious, seasoned well, cooked right, not overly expensive.  I had oxtail stew with cabbage and plantains. With a side of jerk chicken and a ginger beer.  The ginger beer was the only weak spot but that may just be my preference, everything else was very tasty.The bad:  the location and the lack of seating.  With food that good it would be nice to eat there.Do yourself a favor a try them out."
3 star rating,This place is great! I ordered the curry and jerk chicken mix. The portion size blew me away. The tenderness was fantastic. You will definitely be full upon leaving. I have had the opportunity to taste authentic Caribbean and Jamaican jerk and this place truly delivers. Plantain was sweet but not to my liking. A little too sweet. Prices are decent.
5 star rating,"Wow! I mean, WOW!!!I was along the 8 Mile corridor in Southfield and decided to see what was available for take-out on my way home east. This place is right on 8 Miles, and I thought, ""Hey, I haven't had Caribbean food in a while!""  I didn't look too closely at the reviews, or even how many people had rated it; no reason not to try it. And I am glad I did!First off, even though the counter is really high and I'm really short, the staff acknowledged me and offered assistance. I perused the extensive menu and noticed the vegetarian options. I'd be flipping out if I found this place while I was still veg. The rest of the menu was divided by poultry, red meat and seafood. The lady behind the counter asked if I needed any help. I said ""I've never had Jerk oxtail but I'm thinking of getting that."" She said, ""do you want to try it?"" Uh... YES! She brought out a little tasting cup and spoon for me, and YUM! The flavors were so robust, the meat so tender, with a balanced amount of gelatin. I decided to go with the combo where I get 2 meats with cabbage, plantains and beans&rice. I got the jerk oxtail and the curried chicken. I'm gonna try the goat next time.My vocabulary is lacking in how to explain the food. I've had Jamaican food but I don't remember it being this delicious. Even if you don't like cabbage, I'm sure you'd love this. The beans & rice were so flavorful, especially after soaking in the rich spices from the jerk and curry sauces. The meats were still tender and I loved sucking the flavored marrow and gelatin out of the oxtail bones .I'll definitely be stopping by this place again.(PS - Pineapple Upside Down Brownie. WHAAAAT???? Soooooo gooood!)"
5 star rating,"This is as authentic as it gets around here!First as someone noted before their number has changed. Use phone number 313.659.6033 to place a pick up order.Inside is small, I would suggest carry-out over dining in.  I had ordered two spicy jerk chicken dinners. These include the chopped jerk chicken over a bed of rice and peas. Also it comes with a small side on plantain and cabbage. The sizes range from small-large. I had ordered a large for my father (which he had enough to take for lunch the next day) and a medium for myself (I also had leftovers). Two larges would definitely feed three people generously. I thought everything was delicious! So flavorful, chicken was tender! The closest thing I have tasted to Jamaican cooking besides Jamaica, of course. The real test was my father. He was born and raised in Jamaica and he was impressed! He raved about it. Even if you do not have an appreciation of island cuisine I would still say you have to try this place!Unfortunately, her patty cooker was down, so I am unable to critique the patties, but if they're anything like the chicken, they have to be out-of-this-world scrumptious! Probably beat the frozen pattys from Sam's Club that we are currently settling for."
5 star rating,Holy crap this place is the best!My husband and I went to Jamaica for our honeymoon and so badly have missed this food. I'm so glad this is by my house and I can hit it up all the time.Get the jerk chicken and curry chicken. Gotta get a beef patty!Warning: their spicy is SPICY!Great food. Great prices. Great portions. Great hours!
5 star rating,The jerk chicken entree is worth trying. Never disappointed when i come here. Seasoned perfectly and the right amount of spice!
5 star rating,This was my first time here and the diced chicken surprised me but it was actually delicious I got medium spice and it was PERFECT  it burned my mouth then disappeared and i got to enjoy the taste. The cabbage is also good too which surprised me
5 star rating,"Are you looking for authentic Jamaican Food?You are! Let me get right to it. I've been raised eating Jamaican food (Dad Is Jamaican). And I can tell you this place is legit. As you walk in you'll notice the place is small with the menu on the wall. But make sure you call ahead to place your order. I made the mistake of not doing so and my wait was longer than what I was told. The UPSIDE is that you know your food is being made fresh.Also, the staff is friendly and are very attentive to you. You won't have a bad experience here. Food is great!"
4 star rating,"First time having authentic Jamaican food.  The Jerk Chicken was absolutely delicious!  I tend to shy away from very spicy food but they ask what you prefer.... I got it ""mild"" and it was just the right amount of heat and was not too overwhelming.  It was a great pair with the rice and beans and cabbage.  I could eat the plantain's as a dish all by itself!  So good.  And if you like ginger...the Jamaican Ginger Beer (a non-alcoholic beverage) was worth trying.  I definitely recommend calling ahead if your doing takeout.  It is a fairly small place with little seating, so probably not a good place for a large group or dining in.  Will definitely be returning."
4 star rating,"I CANNOT get enough of the brown chicken stew. It's so, so, so delicious. The quality is consistent and it's such a good value for the price."
5 star rating,"My friends at work and I get carryout from the JP pretty regularly, and I only recently discovered it. Lemme tell you, the brown chicken stew is the best thing in the world. And the beef patties are pretty good, too. Listen. The brown chicken stew is incredible. It's tender chicken in a deep, savory sauce, over rice & beans with cabbage. The chicken is like butter, it's so tender. There's no hint of fat or rubbery nastiness, just soft, savory chicken. I could go on & on. I didn't much care for the BBQ chicken as the sauce was just too smokey for my preference, and I prefer the stewed chicken. But that's just me. I've never been inside the place as my friend usually picks up, but the food is delicious. The small $5 lunch portion is a lot of food for the price. Highly recommend."
5 star rating,"I love this place! I have never had a bad meal here.. the only reason I'm taking a star away is because they are usually out of cornbread!! Consistently!! & it breaks my heart.. no matter what time of day you go, cornbread is never in stock. I think they're just not making it, but idk why. Cornbread is the perfect accessory for these types of meals. Other than than, I have no complaints. The meat is always fresh, and seasoned well. The cabbage always has just the right amount of crunch. The servings are more than enough. This place is a hidden gem in the Motor City, and a must to go to!"
4 star rating,Had a taste for some spicy beef patties...and I was not disappointed! They were perfect. Delicious with some Jamaican Kola Champagne to wash it down. I'll definitely be back.
5 star rating,"I have just recently returned from Jamaica and came upon The Jamaica Pot back here in Detroit, Michigan. OMG, the jerk chicken was better then what I had in Jamaica. Hands down this is the best Jamaican good I've had in the States so far."
5 star rating,"I've been to this restaurant a few times and they come to my job once a month to sell food. Honestly I've never been truly impressed by the food. I always order the jerk chicken, which more-so resembles bbq chicken in my opinion...FYI it is chopped boneless skinless chicken breast I would much rather prefer chicken with skin and bone.Today my boyfriend and I popped in for lunch just to grab 2 beef patties. Both patties were cooked to cremation! The crust was burnt and the filling was dried out. How could they mess up a beef patty I thought, but they did... I will post pics. What bothered me the most was the person who bagged these up and sold them to me, they knew they were inedible. Quality control needs to be better."
1 star rating,"Try the jerk chicken very tasty and just the right amount of spice. Don't try to eat in your car, this requires a seat at the table with a cold ginger beer. Fast service with friendly staff.  stop here for taste of Jamaica"
4 star rating,This food is so good and so seasoned I could cry. Exactly what I would be expecting from Jamaican food!!!!!! I will definitely be back. The jerk chicken is so perfectly seasoned and ouch. I am in complete heaven! I can not wait to go out my way to frequent this place. Who needs Jamaica when you you've got this place!!!! Literally going back in the morning :)
5 star rating,"When your tongue calls for something carribean and fun, you can't settle for carribean jerk at Buffalo Wild Wings, you got to come to The Jamaican Pot. I ordered jerk chicken combo the regular size which was $13. Also got a beef patty, just to try it from this place. This is a tiny restaurant, only 3 tables to dine in and no bathrooms, so eat at your discretion.The place is simple, easy picture menus, a couple of desserts displayed behind the glass along with their almost finished patties. The workers were extremely nice and welcoming. The jerk chicken was such a huge quantity for a regular and for it's price. It comes with a side of cabbage, plantains and rice. The plantains were extremely sweet and delicious to mix up the taste palate party. The jerk chicken had such a kick to it, delicious flavor, such homestyle cooking you could taste the love put in to it. I'm salivating as I write jibberish but it was amazing. Also got a jamaican passion drink to wash it all down and it was locally made and so refreshing. Great pairing with the jerk chicken. You can adjust the spice level to everything you order by the way which is nice!"
5 star rating,"I am Jamaican-American. I rarely eat at Jamaican restaurants. I ordered curry goat w/rice & peas, cabbage, fried plantain, and 2 beef patties. The patties were good. The rice & peas were ok. The plantain had a horrible taste like rancid oil. The cabbage was good. The curry goat was not what I expected. In Jamaica, the goat is served in large braised hunks of tender meat. This was served chopped fine, like canned tuna. Very little actual goat meat. It was mostly bones, fat, cartilage, and tiny shreds of goat meat. When I eat curry goat, I want hunks, not splinters. Please change the frying oil. The horrible aftertaste is bad!"
3 star rating,"Small mom and pop type restaurant with great food located in a strip mall. AMAZING spicy jerk chicken! The ackee and saltfish was good, but I think I might had gotten too much saltfish since it was a little on the salty side... sad they were out of beef patties. Plantains were sweet and delicious. Definitely check this place out!"
4 star rating,"I was kind of disappointed with my experience here. We ordered the ox tails and it was mostly heavy sauce and bone, with hardly any meat. I liked the ginger and passion fruit drink and the plantains (although it was a pretty small side). I'd give them another try."
2 star rating,"As someone that lived in St. Thomas for 4 years for work, I am a tough critic when it comes to quality Caribbean cuisine.  There aren't many options in the Metro Detroit area and they often leave much to be desired.  I was delighted when I took a chance and tried Jamaican Pot.All of the food is made to order, so call ahead if you don't want to wait 15-20 minutes for your carryout.  I have going here several times and strongly recommend the Jerk Chicken (though it's sweeter than what I'm used to), Oxtails, and the beef patties for when I want something filling yet not too heavy.  For anyone trying this Caribbean for the first time, get the Jerk and Curry chicken combo so you can get a true sense of your preference.  You won't regret it!"
5 star rating,"My husband has been begging for curry goat since he returned from NYC. I did a quick search and found this place about 15 minutes from home, so we thought we'd try it. So glad we did! The jerk chicken was good but a little sweeter  than what I'm used to and the pepper steak was awesome. However, the curry goat was phenomenal, as well as the cabbage and plantains. All I can say is WOW! And next time I'm getting the curry goat!"
5 star rating,Amazing food at a very nominal prize ! Jerk chicken and the curry chicken were really tasty and the fried plantain and cabbage as sides were excellent too !
5 star rating,"I've been here twice and both times they have shown love. The food is amazing and packed with flavor, the 3 things I've had over my 2 trips are Oxtails, jerk chicken, jerk shrimp, and I was completely satisfied with the different proteins they offered. This is one of the most legit Jamaican restaurants I've been too and I will continue to come when I come back to Detroit."
5 star rating,"Really good service, and great food. I got the jerk chicken and the oxtail and my gf got the goat curry. The chicken was amazing. It was spicy, even for mild, and I really enjoyed that. The goat was a little rough, but it wasn't that bad. It tasted legit though. The oxtail wasn't fall of the bone delicious, but it was seasoned well enough. All in all, i would definitely go back here."
4 star rating,Decided to stop in because I had a taste for Jamaican food! I was not disappointed. The Jamaican Pot is strictly carry out. To avoid a wait order ahead! The jerk shrimp was very tasty (I ordered mild) by more sweet than spicy and served with a load of sautéed peppers. The oxtails were quite good and the curry goat was NOT just a bunch of bones. And the beef patties were nice and flaky!
4 star rating,My daughter found this place ! She was  in the mood for some ox tails She ordered two dinners when we got there only one was ready they forgot the other dinner. When we got home it was maybe 4 little bones I felt like a dog on treat night ! Sorry Jamaican Pot
2 star rating,This is my favorite Caribbean spot! Order anything on the menu and you will love it! I have never been disappointed with anything I've ordered!
5 star rating,"Great Jamaican food every time.  Very quick and efficient service.  I would suggest checking out the menu and placing your order online.  It will be ready by the time you get there.  This is definitely a take out joint, with the requisite ""bullet-proof"" plexi-glass security infrastructure common in many Detroit neighborhood eateries. The food is excellent.  They have a wide variety of Jamaican foods, ad combination plates available to your liking.  Definitely worth the visit if you are into Jamaican."
4 star rating,It was pretty good. This was my first time at the location. I had the small jerk chicken plate and it was a nice size. The lunch special was only 6.95 it came with the cabbage and fried plantains. The plantains where amazing!!! The cabbage was ok and I got my jerk chicken spicy. The chicken and a good smokey flavor and a good taste of jerk sauce. I would love to try this location again just to see if it is truly a good Jamaican spot.
4 star rating,The Jamaican Pot has THEE BEST food. Most authentic Jamaican food in Detroit. I just wish they would get more than one phone line. It's so hard to get through to even make an order. Hope they consider it
4 star rating,This is the best jerk I've had in a long time!!! The place is simply amazing. All their meat is halal too so that should draw in more people. A small size dish is sufficient for most. A medium could feed almost 3 people.
5 star rating,"I have to give this place a low rating because it literally gave me the runs right after, portion wise was kind of small and pretty expensive considering the neighborhood...I've had much better of oxtail in other cities like Toronto and Houston"
2 star rating,Had a taste for some spicy beef patties...and I was not disappointed! They were perfect. Delicious with some Jamaican Kola Champagne to wash it down. I'll definitely be back.
5 star rating,"Even though they have a small dine in area, I've never seen anyone eat inside. Most people usually order to go. So if you're ordering to go, I would recommend calling ahead of time. Sometimes it's difficult to get through but keep trying, it'll save you time from having to wait if you order when you get to the restaurant. By the way they're not open on Sundays. So you'll have to make sure to stop by Monday through Saturday. I usually order a large portion. It's a lot of food for one person but it's only about a couple of bucks extra and I can save the rest for later. They have a small parking lot, so parking is tight. Now that I have that out of the way, My favorites items that I usually order are the jerk chicken and curry goat. You may want to order the mild jerk chicken as the spicy is a little too hot. The food here is amazing I can't wait to try everything else on the menu!"
4 star rating,"I can't believe I discovered this place so late in my life! I am only dramatic after eating Jerk chicken / Curry chicken with hot sauce! Filled with flavor and emotions . This is place is a Gem!Mi nuh have nutten fi complain bout, mi life irie."
5 star rating,Some of the best Jamaican food I had in a long time and I eat it many spots jerk chicken was great boneless like no other everything came together very great flavor was great the line was long but it was worth the wait if you want to eat here just called it in earlier.
5 star rating,This place is Amazing! If you're ever in the area and craving Jamaican food I highly recommend this place! I'm a sucker for plantains cooked the right way and they do! I normally pay a picture with my reviews but I was hungry and ate it all before I remembered. Sorry
4 star rating,I didn't know this place was so close to me so I checked it out. I ordered the oxtails and the Jerk Chicken dinners and 4 beef pies. I enjoyed the dinners but sent my beef pies home with my godmother by mistake. So will have to get them again the next time I'm there.I will try the pepper steaks because my husband may like those. He doesn't care for exotic foods if you can believe that.
4 star rating,Found this little gem while doing my Clinical fieldwork in Southfield.  Small place that is just carry out but man their jerk chicken packs some intense delicious flavor.  So good.  Can't wait to go back.
5 star rating,"I haven't been here in a few years and I went today and I am more than dissatisfied. I ordered the medium oxtails with rice, peas and plantains. The food was AWFUL! The oxtails were small pieces of fat NO meat and it's understandable the oxtails are sliced thin but this was almost nonexistent. The rice was over cooked and there was about five peas. I didn't eat anything else. I will NEVER return to this restaurant as the restaurant workers were unorganized and borderline rude plus when I returned to get my food one young lady didn't have on a hair net. Please do better I won't know if anything changes as I won't return and to add insult to injury this awful plate was $14. Not too high if the food was good but for bad oxtails and over cooked rice 14 is Wow! Instead of taking ANY responsibility for the experience there's an insult. The reply to my review was just as bad if not worst than the food and service. I'm happy I'd decided to not return to this establishment and I will make sure I tell everyone far and wide about my experience, also to advise them not to patronize this establishment. Good day!"

The 1st time I experienced their food was due to me following the scent... the staff was great.. the facility was clean and my meal was absolutely Great! Stop in for a taste!! Its worth the short wait and very affordable!"
5 star rating,Our first visit to order the jerk chicken and bbq chicken meals were not flavorful as we expected. When bitten into the chicken it tasted like the chicken was not cooked all the way through. I didn't eat much but ate the red beans and rice. Could be more flavorful but that's just my preference. The plantains was ok. I'd try it again if the food was more flavorful than today. Better luck next time.
2 star rating,Very slow and do not follow the 5 person rule in the lobby!  I will never eat here again!
1 star rating,"Everyone was super nice and friendly. Very small waiting area, but I met a nice gentleman who had just come back from an annual trip to Jamaica, and wanted a try out a new Caribbean spot. I came here starving after a challenging day at work. Normally, I am a patient person, but I was hangry and saw the sign on the wall say that they don't serve fast food, but fresh to order. (The wait was only 15 min, but you know) Luckily, they have those flaky, beef patties ready to go at the counter and I wolfed one down while waiting for my goat curry.So worth the wait. That goat curry was tender and delicious. Pieces are cut small, with some bone in. I don't mind it at all, but good to know for people not used to eating goat. (I recently warned friends about the goat curry at another local ethnic restaurant, which includes skin and considerable fat. Not everyone wants THAT authentic of an experience:)I did not grow up eating this kind of food, but I can't wait to go back and get some more of that spicy curry. I love having leftovers, which I add extra vegetables and rice to, because the gravy is that good."
4 star rating,"This was my first time at Jamaican Pot! I walked in and immediately heard Bob Marley playing so I knew that I was in for a treat. I ordered the small portion of oxtails which includes rice, cabbage and plantains. The smaller portion was the perfect size for myself, I also grabbed an Jamaican Pineapple soda as well. The cashier advised me that it would be about 15 minutes for my order to come up. I used that time to visit the store next door for a bottle of water as well. The Jamaican Pot is essential a carry-out restaurant. Once making it home I dove into the food and was pleasantly surprised, the food was amazing and I will definitely be returning!"
4 star rating,"I was excited to try this place out as I have been craving jerk chicken for a while. We ordered pick up from here and it was pretty good. I have to say I never had jerk chicken prepared like this where it was cut up and boneless. I appreciated not getting my hands dirty, but missed eating it off the bone and took away from the authenticity. The rice was a bit wetter than I expected as well. The plantains were solid as was the cabbage. The rum cake was tasty as well. It was disappointing that they ran out of 3 desserts already when we called to place our order. The oxtail was ok as was the curry chicken. I would probably check out other Jamaican restaurants for comparison in the area to see what they are up against."
3 star rating,"My new authentic discovery in Detroit. Not much room to eat inside so basically a carry out place. I tried the jerk chicken, an all day $3.99 mini lunch combo made spicy and a $2 beef patty to put me over the $5 credit card minimum. I was very pleased. The chicken chunks were tender and blackened with earthy, bold Jamaican spices. Ordered spicy this time which packed a lot of heat. Will go for ""Jamaican hot"" next time where they put raw peppers in it. The pricing is all fair and most entrees come in a ""small"" size which is like a large lunch and a large size which is hungry man sized for dinner or shareable for 2 regular people appetites. On my lunch special the meat sat atop the starch, which was peas and rice (akin to Cajun style dirty rice). The vegetable was a handful of cabbage and a single slice of fried plantain (wish there were a few but the mini lunch sort of small samples all the meal components).So don't be afraid of 8 Mile! This place makes spicy, bold & authentic Jamaican food. Two thumbs up. Next on my list to try here is the beef oxtail meal and curry goat. Yum!!!"
5 star rating,"I was disappointed. The person taking our order was nice and food came out in a timely manner. I ordered small Ox tails, small Jerk The Jerk tasted like it had a slightly spicy BBQ sauce on the chicken. It's not chicken parts, it's chopped chicken which was very lacking, tasted nothing like jerk. I asked for Spicy, it was no where near spicy. The rice and peas were oily. The cabbage bland. The Ox tails were mediocre. But I don't need to return to the Jamaican Pot.  Caribbean Citchen is a much better option for Caribbean food, and I've only been there twice. So disappointed"
4 star rating,"Keep it going Jamaica pot. This is the only place I go to for jerk ckin, today I'm trying the stewed beef. I'm sure it's gonna be on point."
5 star rating,"This place never dissappoints,  i fet the jerk and curry ckn and of course cabbage. I love when its a lil crunchy;) yum,yum,yum.this is my go to place when im starving.im from ny and this is the closet to curry, goat, and jerk as you get.take it from me its good.i eat here at least 4 times or more amonth. and sometimes i want it twice a week.oh btw do u you brown stewed beef or chicken?"
5 star rating,Please bring The Jamaican Pot to the Eastside!!!  I had the Curry Goat and the Jerk Chicken Combo Plate and it was superb!!!  Very well worth the drive!!!  I can't say enough about this place!!
5 star rating,"Mannnnnnnnnn the jerk and curry chicken was amazing and got the hibiscus drink that's Michigan made. If you thought Detroit couldn't have a Jamaican restaurant, think again. Come here for your Jamaican food fix for sure!"
5 star rating,Food wasn't that good at all. There has to be atleast one good Jamaican spot in Detroit I just have yet to locate it...
1 star rating,"Place is so good. Spicy as hell, but damn the shrimp is delicious. Cost is def $$ though, worth every penny."
5 star rating,Ok so this was my first time here...and the Ashley..the girl who takes the order..was really nice and kind..she gave me a free sample of the meat. Which was very nice and I believe all restaurants  should do. She explained the food and origin and taste..she convinced me to try the ACKEE and salt fish..doesnt sound appealing but it turned out to be really good. I also ordered the jerk chicken..also the Plantas was the Best!!!! Omg the caramelized was on point...i definitely will be back....just like Ashley said I will be
5 star rating,Excellent jerk chicken jerk shrimp beef patties just don't order the curry goat unless you like bones cartilage and fat very disappointed and it took 45 minutes to complete my order!
3 star rating,"Came here basically on a Yelp recommendation and also the fact that my wife is half Jamaican and therefore a lover of Jamaican food. The menu is a good size (although bigger than most Jamaican places) and from the menu I went with the beef patty and the triple chicken dinner. The beef patty was really good and to me one of the better one I had (it's good, flaky, a nice spice to it as well). The triple chicken dinner was curry, jerk, and brown stew chicken over rice/beans with cabbage and plantain. The brown stew and jerk chicken was very good, curry was good but could of been spicer. Overall a very good shop if you ask me (this is a takeout place with about 2 tables) and I will be back for more."

Definitely check this place out!"
4 star rating,Bob Marley stew looks like slush( not appealing) and tastes below average. Jerk chicken is not good either - too salty and charred. But the chicken is tender actually.Cashier was pleasant. Juice had too much sugar in it. Seems authentic Jamaican though.
2 star rating,"Update- This is not fake news and I would have thought my review would help you to improve. While I was waiting for my order the young lady taking the order was so ghetto that a couple who was there for the first time decided to leave. I wouldn't give your a second try after your response to my review. Additionally, whoever eats at your establishment doesn't know real Jamaican food because the taste of my rice and peas was clearly not Jamaican cuisine. This is my first time leaving a review on yelp but I thought this location was very unprofessional and the rice and peas were over cooked and unseasoned. I would not recommend this restaurant."

5 star rating,"I can appreciate this kind of small business but for me, this place just didn't work out. I understand that the food is made to order but 45 mins is just too long to wait imo for OK Jerk & BBQ chicken. I just felt like the Jerk Chicken was missing that kick of spice I'm used to. The plantains were bomb, but other than that I think I'll skip this place in the future. Glad others like it and hope it sticks around because we need more small businesses in the neighborhood.Forgot to add, the beef patty was really good and if I came back it would be for a few of those! No wait and piping hot, A+."
3 star rating,"Great place, authentic Jamaican food is hard to find. Right here in the green mile easily accessible for north of 8 Mile and south.

3 star rating,"Some coworkers and I stopped in the Jamaican Pot for lunch. I ordered a beef patty, and the jerk chicken mini lunch (only $3.99!) and it included jerk chicken, rice and peas, and cabbage. Unfortunately, they didn't have the plantains ready, but gave extra cabbage to make up for it.I have to say, this is the best Jamaican food I've ever had. Even without the plantains, which I was kind of disappointed about not being able to try, the chicken is moist and spicy, perfectly flavored (not over-seasoned), the cabbage and rice pair fantastically with the chicken. I highly recommend it. Caribbean comfort food at its best. The beef patty was good to the last bite as well. I gobbled it up so fast, I could have probably eaten another! Delicious!The lady behind the counter is super friendly. There are signs posted that say they are NOT a fast food restaurant, that everything is cooked to order, so please be patient. I believe it. The quality of the food really shows in how everything is prepared, but we really didn't have to wait long. Totally worth the 7-10 minute wait. I'd give this place five stars if it wasn't for the unavailable plantains. Other than that I loved it!"
4 star rating,"One of my favorite spots, being Cuban I don't get a lot of island food when I'm Michigan, I used to eat here like every other day when they first opened and I lived in Michigan on Mark Twain. But I live in Toronto and am never really in the area however, today I was and everything was DELICIOUS AND FRESH AS USUAL, and just as I remember. The rice and peas and cabbage as well as the pea soup and coco bread (always fresh) was divine. I always enjoy these delightful meals. If you're wondering about the sizes, the small veggie is more than enough, they give heaping portions and it's not expensive at all. The Ginger Passion is my favorite and I would literally move in with this family, because next to my own family in Cuba this is the best food I have ever eaten!! Sorry I didn't take pics I ate it too fast..."
5 star rating,I've been to Jamaica and the jerk chicken is very similar to what they had in Jamaica. The potions are fairly balanced and the cake is delicious. My next mission is to try the red snapper
5 star rating,"I grew up around Puerto Rican cuisine which shares many similarities with Jamaican. One of the major ones is our love of plantains. The plantains here were some of the best I have had outside of a restaurant specializing in Puerto Rican food. I got the curry chicken lunch special which came with a hefty portion of rice, meat, plantains, and cabbage. I would recommend going for whatever dish you want. Nothing is bad here. I also got a beef patty which was amazing. Ate it too quickly for pics."
5 star rating,"So delicious. I had the BBQ chicken special. It comes with rice, fried plantains, and cabbage. The bbq sauce is spicy ( just the way I like it). The cabbage is lightly cooked but full of flavor, the plantains are yummmy and the rice has some beans in it. I recommend trying this spot out but call first because they are always busy and the wait is 15 to 20 mins."
5 star rating,"Yelp wants me to write a long review about this place but it's plain and simple: this place is top notch. Fast, friendly service and delicious food. I've tried a few things from here and was never disappointed."
5 star rating,"This place has some of the tastiest food I have ever had.  Their Triple Delight Chicken Combo meal is the best way to get a sample of several things at once.  Jerk Chicken, Brown Stew, BBQ, Curry Chicken are all excellent, so flavorful and all boneless to boot.  Pepper Steak, Oxtail, Curry Goat and their Beef Meat Pies too are all excellent. The rice, cabbage and plantains you get with each meal....oh my....I'm getting so fired up talking about all their wonderful items I gonna have to stop on the way home from work tonight and get a couple of Triple Delights to go.  I have been stopping here for three years now and There are only two problems with The Jamaican Pot, one is that it is really not a sit down restaurant but mostly a take out as there are only two tables inside, and the biggest problem is that they are not located Closer to my house near Roseville.  Thank God they are kinda sorta on my way home, in a round about way, that I don't mind going to when the cravings hit."
5 star rating,"Awesome, this is some of the most flavorful food in all of Metro Detroit ! The Jerk Chicken is fantastic.  They use boneless chicken and it comes in varying degrees of hotness from Mild to satisfy 1st timer's all the way to to Jamaican Hot for the Home-lander's.  The Triple Chicken Delight is a great way to try three different dishes all in one meal.  It's amazing how different each dish taste and yet all are absolutely delicious.  The rice & peas, plantains and cabbage that come with each meal are equally as good.  The Beef Patty's are simply the Best anywhere.  We have tried most everything and have never been disappointed.  Super Friendly staff and owners make you feel so welcome.  Pretty much just a carry-out place...Can't wait for them to someday open a second place over on the East Side of Town...maybe even a nice sit down restaurant...hopefully...But, until then, I will be back again and again...."

Jamaican food was on the July, 2015 itinerary...Eight of us showed up on a Wednesday at noon to try Jamaican cuisine. I had only called ahead a half hour beforehand to give them a heads up. I needn't have bothered, because they didn't change a thing and that's okay for the most part. Nearly all other customers had Jamaican accents so it was obvious we were in the right place. There were only three tiny tables with 2 chairs each in their small lobby area and certainly not a place you would stay intentionally to eat. But the food itself is absolutely delicious. I couldn't decide on the menu, so I ordered lunch portions of both jerk chicken and curried goat. Both came with a side of plantains and cabbage. I asked for spicy and although it was quite mild, the flavors were out of this world!!The medium jerk chicken order was $8.99 and the curried goat was $12.99. Considering the cost of goat, I don't think this was unreasonable. My coworkers tried various things and some were more creative than others. Everyone, and I mean everyone, enjoyed their lunch and would come back. The jerk chicken was a favorite and the Jamaican pepper steak was reportedly ""ok"" in comparison.I knocked them down from 5 stars due to the wait. It was about 20 mins or so. We'll try to call ahead next time. They take credit cards.I believe it was the owner who told us they have purchased the place next door and will be adding a dining area soon. If they get decent staff and make people feel comfortable, they're bound to do an awesome business.If you're looking for an authentic little restaurant or ""diamond in the rough"", this is it! It's a taste of authentic Jamaica right in Detroit. Try it! And watch for the new dining area coming soon. I'd come back just to try the plantains fresh...oh and for more jerk chicken!!"
4 star rating,"This is my first experience with Jamaican food.... and all i can say is shame one me! The food was delicious! The shrimp was tender and flavorful and the rice was amazing as well. I usually can't do spicy food, no spice at all I'm a pansy that gets heart burn really easily and i usually don't like the taste anyway, but this shrimp dish was so well prepared and flavorful that i found myself enjoying every morsel despite the heart burn thay i had to endure a little later, next time I'll make sure to tell them no spice,  hope it doesn't affect the flavor.The service was good, he took our orders with a huge smile on his face and took the time to explain the food to a novice like myself.The only reason this was not a five star experience was the atmosphere. It could use a good interior decorator and a good scrubbing. Overall, I was highly impressed with this place and they made a lover of Jamaican food out of me."
4 star rating,"I really hate leaving poor reviews but I'm really disappointed. The only reason that I'm giving this restaurant one star is because of the decent customer service. This is by far the worst Jamaican food I've had in my life. I'm from south Florida and we have ample Caribbean restaurants, unlike Detroit. I've tried this restaurant on two occasions. The first time I had oxtail, it was tough and bland. Since this place has such great reviews, I thought that maybe I just had a bad experience. Therefore, I decided to give this place a second try. This time, I got the jerk chicken, which was not jerk at all. Sides were also terrible. Sorry. This is not a good Jamaican food."
4 star rating,Amazing food at a very nominal prize ! Jerk chicken and the curry chicken were really tasty and the fried plantain and cabbage as sides were excellent too !
5 star rating,"The food is so good! Period. Beef Patty, Jerk Chicken, and Curry Chicken are a few of my favorites."
5 star rating,"The food is so good! Period. They have changed and no longer accepts debit cards which usually would push me away from a business. However, I will gladly come prepared to pay cash!!I have had the Jerk Chicken, Curry Chicken, Oxtails, and the curry goat!"

5 star rating,Best made Jamaican food hands down! Always fresh made so expect a likkle wait.large  Spicy Jerk is my go to. And I get that side of my jerk. Chicken & Veggie Patties when available are Grrreat. Customer service is improving so I do not have any stress.
5 star rating,Friendly fast service and deliciously authentic food in a clean environment. It's mostly a take our place but they're also a couple places to sit and eat. They also sell alkalized water.
4 star rating,I've been using yelp for a while now but I just decided to make an account for the sole purpose of rating The Jamaican Pot. This place is incredible. I got a med jerk chicken for carry out and it was absolutely delicious. The cashier was a really nice guy and made a ton of great recommendations. I'll prob be here at least 3 times a week. Amazing.
5 star rating,"This is my very first review on Yelp, (although I've been a user for a couple of years ) I went to a Caribbean themed event last night at a cigar bar, that advertised that there would be a ""tasting of Jamaican food..."" My first thought was that it was going to be catered ""Jamaican inspired"" foolishness lol, so I didn't head straight to the buffet. Wrong move on my part. I finally headed over after overhearing that the food was ""So good!"" The first plate (yup 1st) was a small sampler of jerk chicken, plantains, cabbage & rice/beans, which was devoured in minutes. I waited a good & agonizing 15mins before I made my way back to the buffet for a more substantial tasting (#2), I didn't want to be viewed as the ""greedy one"" in this small gathering of people. By the third plate (YES 3rd! Don't judge me, judge ya mutha! ) I didn't GIVE A DAMN what they thought!! This food gave me LIFE! When the organizer announced that there was ""plenty of food"" and to ""eat up"", I swear I wanted to go another round, but sadly there was no way I could do it. It was in that moment I really wished I had ziploc bags in my purse smh Needless to say, I HIGHLY recommend The Jamaican Pot! And will be enjoying their food again very soon...like in the next hour, soon. Right after I hit ""Post"", I'm calling in my order!"
5 star rating,"Sweet god almighty, if you love Jamaican food, go here. If it's your first time trying Jamaican food, go here. If you are someone trying to convince someone how good Jamaican food is, go here. JUST GO HERE. The lady who helped us out at the register (it was our first time coming to this establishment) was so patient with us while we were ordering (we were crazy indecisive but we ended up getting a crazy amount of food any because WHY NOT), and everything was absolutely delicious. Their oxtail is great, their goat is G.O.A.T. and don't even get me started on their desserts. If you can't make up your mind, let me do it for you and just go here. Just go."
5 star rating,"First time having authentic Jamaican food.  The Jerk Chicken was absolutely delicious!  I tend to shy away from very spicy food but they ask what you prefer.... I got it ""mild"" and it was just the right amount of heat and was not too overwhelming.  It was a great pair with the rice and beans and cabbage.  I could eat the plantain's as a dish all by itself!  So good.  And if you like ginger...the Jamaican Ginger Beer (a non-alcoholic beverage) was worth trying.  I definitely recommend calling ahead if your doing takeout.  It is a fairly small place with little seating, so probably not a good place for a large group or dining in.  Will definitely be returning."
4 star rating,"This hole in the wall Jamaican spot is so satisfying with their homemade Caribbean comfort food. Their jerk chicken with rice/beans is out of this world, the fried plantains they serve alongside take away the zing of the spice with their sweetness. They make amazing beef patties too - the crust has some spice and the flavor of the tender beef inside is phenomenal - 2 will fill you up or have one as a snack/appetizer! My husband enjoys the beef oxtail meal, and he likes their cabbage. Their portions are also very generous which keeps us coming back for more!"
5 star rating,Good food good service good location. Was the first time I ate Jamaican cuisine. I was impressed.
5 star rating,"This is my first time at The Jamaican Pot.The girls working there were polite and friendly, the place was clean, and Jigsy King was playing.  I left good going in.The jerk chicken was very mild and did not taste authentic.  But you would probably have to have had jerk chicken from a vendor in the streets of Jamaica to realize this or spend most of your life in Jamaica and had a uncle that loved to cook.  Ahhhhh, the good ol' days!The curry chicken was mediocre, not authentic either.  Very disappointed.I shoulda just went to Rono's Caribbean Family Dining.Now they know how to jerk some chicken.So I noticed after I posted this review, that the receipt said ""mild"".  I didn't know I was getting mild, and wish they had mentioned that I had an option.Anyways, the jerk sauce DID NOT taste authentic even for mild."
3 star rating,"Awesome experience. Jerk chicken, bbq chicken, curry goat, curry chicken were all amazing! Try the bean soup!!! Ill definitely be coming back here"
5 star rating,"Usually when I want some jerk chicken, I go to Jamaican Fenton's. Didn't feel like making that commute today so I tried out the Jamaican Pot. I got the extra spicy jerk chicken, and man when I say the spice hit me hard, I am not exaggerating. The chicken was very moist, rice was flavorful, and then plantains were sweet and soft. 5 stars hands down. Prior to going, I checked other reviews and it was advised to order at least 30 minutes in advance which worked perfectly."
5 star rating,"At least I know the management here is legit. After writing my previous review, a member of management contacted me to let him know when I'll be in next. Just so they can be sure they have the chicken patties that I come there for. I gotta say, customer service like that is few and far between. It's service like that that drums up repeat business, which is key to a small business succeeding."
4 star rating,"I haven't had any of the entrees but the curry chicken patty and coco bread was spot on, just the right amount of spice. It made me feel like I was back home, I was getting nervous that Michigan didn't have any good Jamaican food places.Update: The food was good, but they never have any curry chicken patties. I've showed up a few times and they never have them, so I just started to save myself the gas and call ahead. They said that there's not really a demand for curry chicken patties, which I can understand. But I feel like they never have them when I visit/call, and they couldn't tell me when they would have them. I'm really happy I found a Jamaican place I love, but bummed that they never have the product I want to order."

5 star rating,My first time eating Jamaican food and it was delicious!!!Also the staff was very nice!
5 star rating,"The food is delicious however they seem to always be slow and out of items in the beginning of the day. This is a definite sign of poor management and preparation in the restaurant business. I am guessing that the owners were told that they make delicious food and should open a restaurant without knowing how to run one efficiently/. Maybe they need to know that when you run a food business, it is impossible to make each order to order. Maybe they need to arrive earlier in the morning, cook large quantities, hold the food properly and serve it quickly. Business would triple if people knew you could get in and out in less than 10 minutes. Even when you call in an order and get a pickup time, it's never ready. They also need to make sure, regardless of how many pieces they sell of an item, to either have it or take it off the menu.  If you have time to wait and are willing to change your order because what you want isn't available, then I suggest to give it a try."
3 star rating,Delicious!! Oxtails were on point and the curry chicken was so good! Worth the 30 minute drive.
4 star rating,"Very impressed with my experience here. Small hole in the wall place. Very friendly staff. Had the jerk chicken lunch special and it hit the spot. Good portion, well balanced, not overpriced. I would come here again and recommend it to all. Very flavorful food!"
5 star rating,"Great service and quick if you call ahead. The mild bbq and jerk are good, but I think it would be more flavorful if you choose spicy. I will next time. Plantains, cabbage and beef patties are all excellent."
5 star rating,"Great Jamaican food every time.  Very quick and efficient service.  I would suggest checking out the menu and placing your order online.  It will be ready by the time you get there.  This is definitely a take out joint, with the requisite ""bullet-proof"" plexi-glass security infrastructure common in many Detroit neighborhood eateries. The food is excellent.  They have a wide variety of Jamaican foods, ad combination plates available to your liking.  Definitely worth the visit if you are into Jamaican."
4 star rating,"Well....it hurts me to post only a 3 star review, but out of the 3 meat combo plate I ordered, only 1 was good. I could've passed on the browned stewed and curry chicken, both were very bland. My favorite of the 3 was the jerk chicken. I personally appreciated how they cut up the chicken and its ready to eat, vs having it on the bone and you having to take it off. The veggies, rice and beef patty were good though, but because Ive had better, only 3 from me."
3 star rating,"Had been meaning to try this place for quite a while and am glad I did... as other reviews have said, there are two small tables but it is effectively carry out only and the food does take a while to be prepared... but well worth the wait... I tried the Jerk Shrimp at medium spice... serving size was easily enough for two... the rice, beans and pepper mixture was very tasty... the cabbage salad and plantains are sides included with the meal and also were good... give it a shot...you shouldn't be disappointed"
5 star rating,"So admittedly I have never had Jamaican food. My boyfriend and I were feeling adventurous so we decided to give this place a try after seeing good things about it online. We split a large meal with 3 different types of chicken, jerk, brown and barbecue. It also came with cabbage and plantains. I am sooo glad we gave this place shot, the food was excellent. Normally I'm not a fan of the flavor of cabbage but it was not as strong as I'm used to (and I mean that in a good way). I'm glad they have the option to choose different types of meat in a single dinner because we got to try different things without having to order too much. The whole point was to figure out which type of chicken would be our favorite...problem is it's all so good! We also decided to get some apple cobbler for dessert. Normally the crust is the worst part of the cobbler but even that was divine. Overall the meal was affordable, a large was enough to split between 2 people with leftovers. I would definitely recommend this place to others. So delicious!"
5 star rating,This place is Amazing! If you're ever in the area and craving Jamaican food I highly recommend this place! I'm a sucker for plantains cooked the right way and they do! I normally pay a picture with my reviews but I was hungry and ate it all before I remembered. Sorry
4 star rating,Decided to stop in because I had a taste for Jamaican food! I was not disappointed. The Jamaican Pot is strictly carry out. To avoid a wait order ahead! The jerk shrimp was very tasty (I ordered mild) by more sweet than spicy and served with a load of sautéed peppers. The oxtails were quite good and the curry goat was NOT just a bunch of bones. And the beef patties were nice and flaky!
4 star rating,"Call ahead! All food made to order, so if you don't be prepared to wait.  I waited 20 minutes, but didn't mind that day.I ordered the Jerk Chicken Large Lunch deal, spicy, and it came with a plantains, beans & rice (they call beans, peas!),  and a hot cabbage salad.  I also ordered a beef patty, a chicken curry patty, 2 Coco breads, and a  small rum cake.  This was more than enough to fill 2 people.  The Jerk Chicken was to die for!  It was spicy, and I usually like Thai food at a medium + level, and that is what I equate the spicy Jerk chicken to.  Very flavorful, and delicious.The plantains were good, not too sweet, starchy, or greasy.  The cabbage side was warm cabbage salad with a touche of acidity to it, and it went perfect with the Jerk chicken.The Patties I ordered just had meat in them, no vegetables, but were quite tasty.  I think I liked the beef over the chicken curry better.The Coco bread was a huge, soft, yeasty bun, that was a pleasure to eat.  A tad sweet, but I really dug how soft & spongy the bread was.The only item I didn't much care for was the rum cake.  It literally tasted like you were chewing dark rum.  There wasn't any sweetness to it at all, and after having spicy food, I love washing it down with something sweet.  Good thing the rest of the food was phe-nom!"
5 star rating,"This restaurant sits on the edge of Southfield (but is considered Detroit). Carryout type of place - just chairs and 1 table is you really want to sit here though.Paying for my food was a little tricky. I'm just under 5ft, and the counter is at 5ft haha. The lady behind the counter was sweet too; called me Bite-sized ;)Got the Curry chicken and jerk/bbq? chicken (I actually ordered a jerk shrimp and didn't check till I got home, -1 star). Tasted good regardless, but not what I ordered. They wrap the Togo boxes and give you silverware too. Paid ~$23.You pick your spicy level. (Got hot and it wasn't that spicy for reference). My favorites were the plantains and cabbage sides that come for free with the entree. The plantains were not dripping in grease (THANK YOU!). I'm willing to try them again, but I'll open and check my order before walking out.P.S. check out the song on their website. It's pretty sick ;)"
4 star rating,"Amazing food, and inexpensive. Be sure to call ahead if you don't want to wait about 15 minutes. It is definitely a carry-out place, all food is packaged to-go and there are just a couple tables. The staff was pretty friendly, though the table we sat at was a bit sticky, and some of the sodas we got weren't cold. Really tiny issues that won't keep me from coming back here again."
4 star rating,"Well Yelpers, this saga continues. This is the owner's latest chilling private response to my review:""Why don't you just move on, as no one but you cares about your ignorant comments.

1 star rating,"So, the owner is a little scary my fellow Yelpers. This is the message he sent to me privately: 6/28/18 @12:08pm""Your not worth another comment publicly, as it is obvious you are a hater and a liar to boot. As for that bless day I wish you, it would appear you enjoy to be a curse instead.""Then he posted this message the same day:6/28/2018  ""You say you can tell i am not in the restaurant that often. Seems to me, your review is suspect at best. Point out my F word, copy and paste it in another low IQ comment.I suspect you are most likely some flunky we just terminated, which is why you stated facts not in evidence to anyone but you.(how much time i spend in the restaurant).Now then, we can both have our own opinion..... but only one of us has the facts.""Wow. I saw a review he posted about Office Depot that was really disturbing. But he seems particularly nice to female Yelpers (with photos). I didn't think my review should have elicited such a hostile retort from an owner. There seems to be something amiss with this guy, he is taking this one bad review personally. I would hate to think of what would have occurred had I complained in person. What business owner can't take criticism? Do some quality control and move on, or don't. I can only tell what my experiences in his restaurant were. He seems like a bully."
1 star rating,"I can tell you are not actually in the restaurant that often and if you are, then the bad service happened on your watch. You can take that L and make corrections or stay in your feelings about my comment. You, and people like you, make it hard to ""shop my block"". BAD SERVICE it's almost always BAD SERVICE. If it's not BAD SERVICE then it's BAD ATTITUDE. Your employees managed to give BAD SERVICE but not BAD ATTITUDE, I guess they were saving that for you. Do better.  ""You have a blessed day"" as well, in the same way you meant it for me. P.S. What is the difference between me writing ""WTF"" and you writing ""the f word""? There are some semantics I'm missing here."
1 star rating,"Can you tell me why the food is never ready when you call it in? Today I called in 2 orders Jerk Chicken and Curried Goat. Came to pickup it up, all the way from Downtown mind you, and it still was not ready. The goat wasn't ready and they forgot to put in the other order. WTF? I'm voting them off the island the food is good but I don't have time for bad service anymore this has happened too many times with them. I mean literally something goes wrong with our order every time. We are DONE with them."
1 star rating,"Well my mom is from Jamaica born and raised.. I have eaten Jamaican food all my life. I tried the Jamaican pot when it first opened about maybe 5 years ago give or take.. and I didn't care for the food then. But I decided to give it another shot.. it's been a while. I ordered Jerk chicken, curry chicken and oxtails for my family. My opinion is that the food is unauthentic, has little to no flavor and after trying it again today it hasn't changed. I believe it's catering more to the American flavor vs. Authentic Jamaican. However I will say that the beef patty was tasty! If your looking for authentic Jamaican food.. this would not be it. It's Americanized...Jamaicans have bones in there food... not diced up chicken.. but hey I'm just one person. Try it for yourself."
1 star rating,"We have been coming here for years. They were one of the most decent Jamaican eatery's you can find in Detroit but honestly they've fallen off. I ordered the jerk chicken dinner extra spicy and this is the THIRD time they gave me barbecue chicken. I called back but of course no one answered. I never write poor reviews but this place is so inconsistent, I just couldn't help myself. Especially after the third time they messed up my order. Mind you I'm not even mad about the patty and koko bread that was missing from my order. So needless to say I will be looking for a new Jamaican spot."
3 star rating,"Usually don't give negative reviews, but I have to say coming from home West Indian, (Grenada )know what it supposed to taste like, real authentic Jamaican food, go to Caribbean Kitchen, that's some good food"
1 star rating,This place is absolutely wonderful. When you walk in it's so bright and upbeat and the staff is very friendly. The jerk chicken is to die for and the peach cobbler is one of the best I've had. They really do a great job. We will be back many times! Can't wait to try everything else!
5 star rating,"Moved back to Detroit from Chicago a few months ago, where I frequented Mr Brown's Lounge for their authentic Jamaican jerk wings. Thought I'd have a hard time finding something as good here in Detroit, but MAN was this stuff good. We ordered a large jerk chicken entree and it was more than enough for 2 people to share, plus it was the perfect amount of spice. Will definitely be coming back in the future."

5 star rating,This is the real deal. Just stopped by for my first time. The owners and staff were very friendly. The prices were very reasonable and they offered me samples.I just finished eating and I must say that I am content. This is the real Jamaican restaurant in Oakland County that you must visit.

4 star rating,"Best jerk chicken I've had from a restaurant for sure. I like that they are sauced unlike Fenton's which is a dry jrub The oxtails were good but a small portion size and mostly bone. I hate rice but the red beans and rice went well with the oxtail and jerk chicken. The cabbage was just ok. I wish they had more choices of sides other than automatically getting rice, cabbage and plantains. Ordered via doordash which didn't give options to change sides. Curry chicken is fire too"

Beef patties, oxtail and rice and peas was so tender and juicy. My husband couldn't get enough of it. The cabbage and fried plantain was cook to perfection. The jerk chicken was seasoned and right off the grill. Taste like I was eating in my mom's kitchen in Kingston Jamaica. The chicken soup was so good a meal by itself with bites of corn on the cob, dumplings and yam a authentic Jamaican soup. Go visit The Jamaican Pot. The food is cooked with love and Rose is the nicest, sweetest host you could talk. Good luck. I will be back"

I used to work right around the corner years ago and it wasn't there then, but it is now and I have to say that Detroit is long overdue for some friendly neighborhood restaurants with good food and service at reasonable prices. Thank God for the Jamaican Pot! I drive from northwestern Oakland county to come here. I always get the jerk chicken plate (large) and that comes with the rice and beans mix, and fried plantain (which I had never had-yummy) and the cabbage (though I prefer my cabbage to be cooked a little more tender) and cornbread. I have yet to be disappointed!  The peach cobbler and the lemon pound cake are great as well! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK JAMAICAN POT!!!!!! I will definitely keep coming back!!!!!!!!"
5 star rating,"I had to log into my husband's account to write my review. I do not write reviews on restaurants, but this restaurant deserves rave reviews. This was my first time visiting this place today, I was not sure what I should get, but I knew I wanted bread with my food. I looked over the menu and saw cornbread; I was okay. I ordered the jerk chicken lunch special. The lunch specials are inexpensive (11-2pm) and you can try a mini size portion. The boxes are big, and you get more than you pay for, which is always a plus. When I placed my order, they did not have cornbread, but the young women recommended the coco bread. I am so glad I tried it because it is fantastic. Do you here me! Fantastic! It was hot, good and so very yummy. The bread had just come out the oven, and it was EXCELLENT. I would definitely recommend this place. If you have never tried Jamaican food stop here, you will not be disappointed. The cocoa bread is a must!"
5 star rating,"Food is very tasty. The best Jamaican food I've had in Detroit, and I've tried several. My daughter and I order a beef patty and the Curry chicken/Jerk Chicken plate.

5 star rating,"OMG the food is so delicious!! I was looking for something different to eat and saw the had good reviews. So glad I went there, is was worth it. The guy at the front taking my order was very nice and the owner was very down to earth and friendly!!"
5 star rating,Authentic Jamaican food. My maternal side is Jamaican. I know good Jamaican food. I've been looking for good authentic Jamaican restaurant. And found this place! Food is fresh and flavorful. The patties are amazing! No more frozen in the box patties anymore. The customer service is excellent! I'm all about great customer service!
5 star rating,"Really great, friendly and delicious. A few odd things: the order counter is so high I could barely see the employee, and I'm 5'6"", so that was awkward, and there's no real menu available. The employee basically had to walk me (and every other person in line) through all the different meal options, which makes it a long process. But, the food was terrific, and I will definitely go back. I just hope by then they will have some menus printed so I know how to order."
4 star rating,"Had the Chicken Curry and it was really good. Not too spicy, just the right amount. Decent price for a good meal that feels home made."
4 star rating,"Love it.... first time yesterday and it was amazing, will be going back there very soon. they are very friendly as well and the wait time is very quick. was truly surprise."
5 star rating,My new favorite Jamaican place. I get the curry chicken and jerk chicken with cabbage and plantains and it's sooo good. It's cut up boneless/skinless chicken thighs so you don't have to worry about dealing with a bone. Service is pretty good and I'm glad I finally tried them out.
5 star rating,"As much as I love Jamaican food I am totally shocked that this was my first time hearing about this place. For years I have only patronized one place because I simply didn't know others existed.  I would like to start with the customer service which was awesome, the lady that answered the phone was very professional, very kind and very patient. I would go back just because of her, as customer service is hard to come by nowadays! I ordered the small oxtail entree which was delicious the gravy was very hearty and flavorful and went perfect with the rice. I expected more from the cabbage, I guess I was looking for more flavor and spice. I also tried a beef patty for the first time which was pretty good, especially since I'm not the one to try new foods, every once in a while. Overall this place was great! Friendly, fast and delicious, which is more than enough for me! :-)"
4 star rating,"The food was delicious!! I ordered the oxtail (all entrées come with sweet plantains, rice and beans, and tasty cabbage) which was very tender and well-seasoned. The chef/owner also gave me a sample of her scrumptious jerk chicken and a taste of one of their intensely ginger-y drinks (made with real ginger root and honey, no sugar).I actually spoke with the chef for awhile about her life's journeys (she's originally from Jamaica) and talked a bit with her very friendly son.The food, service, and friendly atmosphere made for a delightful experience.  Highly recommended."
5 star rating,"I had the oxtails, rice and peas with plantains. The oxtails were delicious, moist and tender. I should have gotten some dumplings too. I also had a very delicious red pea soup."
4 star rating,"Food is delicious, I order the jerk chicken dinner it was great, love the plantains I would get extra of them next time. Not a big fan of cabbage but I really like how theirs is done. Service was really good I got in and out pretty fast for it Being a Friday. Definitely will be back again!"
5 star rating,"I got a beef patty, jerk chicken, curry goat, and oxtail. All were delicious but I found the curry goat somewhat bland."
4 star rating,Excelent. Feel Jamaica. Yea mon!I am european and I had the hot jerk chicken. Really enjoyed it. My friends had the curry chicken and they were great.Try their drinks they are great!
5 star rating,"I cant say enough good thongs avout this place! Ive been craving Jamaican food for some time now, and i finally convinced my bf to try it...we walk in and were warmly greeted. After looking at the menu for a miment we both got the jerk chicken (medium spice), and i got the ackee and saltfish ive been craving and he got the curry chicken. All the meals came with fried plaintains which i loved, peas and rice, and cabbage.  All of it was amazing! A woman who i believe to be the owner gave us some samples of soup while we were waiting that was amazing- perfect for a cpld day like today. We will be going back soon and will be adding the bean soup to our next order!"
5 star rating,This company catered to my workplace today in Washington Township. I can not say enough good things about the delicious jerk chicken and plantains . The meal also include rice and a side of cabbage . Do yourself a favor and try their food . Also met the lady that owns the business and she was very helpful and courteous. Doug
5 star rating,This place is very tasty and addictive.  I love how they prepare there Jerk chicken.  Plantains are the bomb.  Good portions.   Best Jamaican in the area.
5 star rating,"I had high expectations that simply were not met.  I think it's a stretch to call this authentic Caribbean food.  If you think salt=flavor then this place is for you. The only enjoyable component of my meal was the 3 small slices of plantains that accompanied my meal.  The curry chicken looked and tasted like canned chicken-bland as can be.  I also tried the ""jerk"" chicken.  It was better than the curry, but ""jerk,"" it was not.  It was barely spiced and lacked the complex flavors that a traditional jerk seasoning should have.  There's definitely a theme in all of the negative reviews; Inconsistent, poor quality, and poor service.  While it's admirable that the owner takes the time to read and reply to reviews, it seems that all he can offer is excuses like blaming issues on the quality of employees.  For business owners, the reality is that you are responsible for your employees and it's up to you to hire and train the right people.  If you can't change the people, change the people."
1 star rating,I can't tell you if the food is small or salty. I can tell you that there's no reasonable explanation for the lack of selection available at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I was told for multiple dish choices that the meat wouldn't be delivered until 4 o'clock and available at an unknown time thereafter. Waste of time. The unprofessionalism is profound.
1 star rating,The first time I went it was absolutely delicious I got the Jerk Oxtails and they were fallen of the bone delicious..Last time it was not right oxtails tough as if not been cooked long enough the jerk sauce was not good rice was mushy ... Fried Plantains were delicious still though probably won't return again because of the inconsistency..
3 star rating,"The food was not good, nor authentic tasting. It was very salty. I was looking for a good jerk chicken and oxtails and I was highly disappointed."

3 star rating,"Everyone was super nice and friendly. Very small waiting area, but I met a nice gentleman who had just come back from an annual trip to Jamaica, and wanted a try out a new Caribbean spot. I came here starving after a challenging day at work. Normally, I am a patient person, but I was hangry and saw the sign on the wall say that they don't serve fast food, but fresh to order. (The wait was only 15 min, but you know) Luckily, they have those flaky, beef patties ready to go at the counter and I wolfed one down while waiting for my goat curry.So worth the wait. That goat curry was tender and delicious. Pieces are cut small, with some bone in. I don't mind it at all, but good to know for people not used to eating goat. (I recently warned friends about the goat curry at another local ethnic restaurant, which includes skin and considerable fat. Not everyone wants THAT authentic of an experience:)I did not grow up eating this kind of food, but I can't wait to go back and get some more of that spicy curry. I love having leftovers, which I add extra vegetables and rice to, because the gravy is that good."
4 star rating,"Delicious. Had the bbq chicken and jerk chicken plate. Plantains were delicious, cabbage was tasty, the ginger passion fruit juice was amazing. The lady working the counter was SUPER nice...when I told her that I hadn't been to the restaurant before she brought me samples of a few different dishes I wanted to try plus a few others that I hadn't considered(how I found the bbq chicken YASSSSS!) They sell bottles of the jerk chicken sauce and have deserts that I want to try. Be warned its not a fast food spot be prepared to wait 15 minutes or so for your food, while not technically a take out spot they only have 2 small tables. Good reggae music playing. Definitely going back!"
5 star rating,"Came here basically on a Yelp recommendation and also the fact that my wife is half Jamaican and therefore a lover of Jamaican food. The menu is a good size (although bigger than most Jamaican places) and from the menu I went with the beef patty and the triple chicken dinner. The beef patty was really good and to me one of the better one I had (it's good, flaky, a nice spice to it as well). The triple chicken dinner was curry, jerk, and brown stew chicken over rice/beans with cabbage and plantain. The brown stew and jerk chicken was very good, curry was good but could of been spicer. Overall a very good shop if you ask me (this is a takeout place with about 2 tables) and I will be back for more."
4 star rating,My wife's Jamaican and she said it's the real deal. We got spicy  Jerk Chicken. The spice is perfect and the rice and peas were great.
5 star rating,"Some coworkers and I stopped in the Jamaican Pot for lunch. I ordered a beef patty, and the jerk chicken mini lunch (only $3.99!) and it included jerk chicken, rice and peas, and cabbage. Unfortunately, they didn't have the plantains ready, but gave extra cabbage to make up for it.I have to say, this is the best Jamaican food I've ever had. Even without the plantains, which I was kind of disappointed about not being able to try, the chicken is moist and spicy, perfectly flavored (not over-seasoned), the cabbage and rice pair fantastically with the chicken. I highly recommend it. Caribbean comfort food at its best. The beef patty was good to the last bite as well. I gobbled it up so fast, I could have probably eaten another! Delicious!The lady behind the counter is super friendly. There are signs posted that say they are NOT a fast food restaurant, that everything is cooked to order, so please be patient. I believe it. The quality of the food really shows in how everything is prepared, but we really didn't have to wait long. Totally worth the 7-10 minute wait. I'd give this place five stars if it wasn't for the unavailable plantains. Other than that I loved it!"
4 star rating,"I am so happy we made the drive it was so worth it. We ordered ox tails,bbq chicken,jerk chicken and curried goat dinners.  Every thing was top notch. I can't wait to come here again!"
5 star rating,"Moved back to Detroit from Chicago a few months ago, where I frequented Mr Brown's Lounge for their authentic Jamaican jerk wings. Thought I'd have a hard time finding something as good here in Detroit, but MAN was this stuff good. We ordered a large jerk chicken entree and it was more than enough for 2 people to share, plus it was the perfect amount of spice. Will definitely be coming back in the future."
5 star rating,"Awesome experience. Jerk chicken, bbq chicken, curry goat, curry chicken were all amazing! Try the bean soup!!! Ill definitely be coming back here"
4 star rating,"At least I know the management here is legit. After writing my previous review, a member of management contacted me to let him know when I'll be in next. Just so they can be sure they have the chicken patties that I come there for. I gotta say, customer service like that is few and far between. It's service like that that drums up repeat business, which is key to a small business succeeding."
4 star rating,"I haven't had any of the entrees but the curry chicken patty and coco bread was spot on, just the right amount of spice. It made me feel like I was back home, I was getting nervous that Michigan didn't have any good Jamaican food places.Update: The food was good, but they never have any curry chicken patties. I've showed up a few times and they never have them, so I just started to save myself the gas and call ahead. They said that there's not really a demand for curry chicken patties, which I can understand. But I feel like they never have them when I visit/call, and they couldn't tell me when they would have them. I'm really happy I found a Jamaican place I love, but bummed that they never have the product I want to order."

5 star rating,"Delicious Jamaican inspired food. I ate it so fast!Although they have tables, I wouldn't recommend eating inside. Best for carry out. Expect large servings, if you aren't a big eater, or not sharing, definitely go with the small."
4 star rating,"Coworkers recommend this place to us. Wow. We had the Jerk and BBQ chicken. I was apprehensive on the BBQ but was very happy that there wasn't gobs of sauce. The Jerk is pretty spicy, even mild. The cabbage was surprisingly good. Oh, and the plantains were AMAZING! I could eat a plate of those alone.They were slammed so we waited a while. We learned nothing is canned or processed, it's all fresh. The desserts and waters are supplied by local entrepreneur vendors.They even gave us a free dessert for the long wait. It's a kind and gracious family run business."
5 star rating,Really good Jamaican. I'm no expert but this was pretty good. Spicy Jerk Chicken and the Goat Curry are my favorite dishes. Their meals come with rice/beans and cabbage.
5 star rating,However the lunch special is deceiving they say that there is only a large or a small size dish during lunch but the large is really a medium. When I first went to this restaurant the portions were a nice size but lately they seem to be smaller today I waited for over an hour for their cornbread and was not even offered an extra napkin for the inconvenience.  I would strongly recommend calling ahead to make sure they have everything before you arrive
3 star rating,"My food was straight fire ! Medium jerk chicken, red beans and rice with cabbage . I smashed my food. My ginger beer was too spicy but I loved the food."
5 star rating,"I love the food at The Jamaican Pot, but I wish there were a dining area and I also wish they would not use styrofoam packaging because it alters the taste of the food (and it is bad for the environment)."
5 star rating,finally a place the rasta can nursish his soul with authentic nutrients bless up many thanks and respect since day one excellent restaurant and amazing food wish i eat there every.day heavydred@gmail
5 star rating,"I am so glad I had the opportunity to try Jamaican Pot. I ordered the jerk chicken mild on top of beans & rice  with a side of cabbage and plantains I also got a beef Patti. The chicken was very flavorful and delicious however it was not the authentic flavor that I was looking for, it had hints soy and BBQ sauces but it was still really really good the plantains were good the cabbage was a little on the cold side but it was still tasty. the beef patty as as well delicious I will definitely be going back here again to try some of their other flavorfull and delicious dishes. I'm looking forward to trying to chicken Stew I had a sample while I was there and I really liked it, so I definitely will be back. Thanks Jamaican Pot!"
4 star rating,"Ok,, so if you haven't had proper Jamaican food before, this spot is probably the best place for you to get your feet wet. Yummy, spicy and savory all in the same time. Jamaican food is probably the best type of Caribbean food as far as I'm concerned. This place right here, is definitely the best place to get it.Growing up in New Jersey, my mother would come home from work at the hospital with some good home cooked Jamaican food from her other nurse friends. This is when I had my first taste of Jamaican patties. Ever since I became a transplant here in Michigan, I have been searching for that certain beef patty. The one that at first bite, will take me back in time when I had my first ever authentic Jamaican beef patties. If you're not used to spicy food, these guys will burn the crap out of your mouth, but trust me, you'll keep eating them because they are that good. The ones that are sold here are by far the best I've had in Michigan.But don't just stop at the patties,, that's just appetizer my friend. Get yourself a some jerk chicken meal my friend. The whole set comes with beans and rice, cabbage and fried bananas. A full ensemble of pure Jamaican goodness all in one styro platter. They make their jerk chicken here extremely good. The meat is juicy, tender and packed with that Jamaican jerk seasoning. You would probably laugh at all other American jerk flavored chicken after you've had whatever that's being served here.Yes it's around the 8mile and Southfield area, there is no denying that this particular spot is in the hood. We still showed up, we came out of our car, entered the establishment, ordered food, waited, took our food, walked back to our car and left. Not even for one single second did we feel like we were in danger. No bullet holes, no gun shots, no drive-by shootings..... You know what?? I'm just glad there's no snooty suburbanites around to ruin my day,,, and for that, I thank you.Life is so much better when you have some real good delicious Jamaican food. And trust me,,, I shall return. Specially for that curry goat and them ox tails."
4 star rating,"Good food, terrible service.  They regularly run out of food.  I have called multiple times, well before they close to get oxtails and jerk chicken dinners.  They usually are out of oxtails.  This has happened in multiple occasions so I give up.  No way you should be out of food at 6pm when you close at 11pm.  Ridiculous."
2 star rating,"Great service and quick if you call ahead. The mild bbq and jerk are good, but I think it would be more flavorful if you choose spicy. I will next time. Plantains, cabbage and beef patties are all excellent."
5 star rating,Family owned and all delicious! The beef patties were amazing and so were the plantains
5 star rating,"Murderer!! Yes, Barrington Levy ""Murderer"" was playing on the stereo when i rolled in on a Monday night. I had the jerk chicken (medium spice), rice, plaintains, and cabbage to go. Excellent taste, seasoning, and most importantly you can feel the love put into this food. Will be back soon & will tell my friends. We need more Carribean gems like this in the area. Open a shop in Oakland County & you will kill it. Murderer!!"
5 star rating,"Ok. Love it. My first time here I tried the pepper steak and rice mild and it was some of the best I had. So my second time here was the very next day. I had curry chicken,one of each beef and chicken patties. Delicious again! So a few days later I had a hankering for BBQ chicken and my usual BBQ place was closed so I headed to yelp to see who had it and sure enough I was lead to tjp. I knew to call it in but when I got there it was a nice line. No worries but what stuck out to me was the chef came out to see how everyone was doing and if we would like free samples of the squash soup. How many times must I say delicious? Not only did he bless us with flavorful food but he took time to explain why you must eat certain foods and when. That showed me this person loves their craft. I know I'm being selfish for not giving 5 stars but my only hang up is its dine out only. I'm gonna continue to support in hopes they expand. Please go try this place. You can't go wrong."
4 star rating,The number has changed. 313-659-6033. I happen to be in the neighborhood and found this spot. Luv it. I will be back.
5 star rating,"The food is definitely fresh and hot. The staff is very pleasant and they have a good variety of options. Being my first visit , I can't comment on all the entrees, but I'm confident that they are consistent. I recommend them!"
5 star rating,"Love this place. I'm usually getting the jerk dinner or brown stew both of which are phenomenal! All meals come with rice and peas, cabbage, and fried plantains. On the side I also order a beef patty. I've never had a bad experience and the owners are such great people. The desserts can be a bit pricey but taste good most of the time."
5 star rating,Went today and ordered the mini jerk chicken... the jerk chicken isn't real jerk seasoning.. it's bbq sauce.. I thought it was a mix up until I read other ppl reviews stating the same thing. Smh
1 star rating,"Food is MOST excellent! Service is TOP NOTCH! Great group of chefs and servers, and their catering service is A1!!! Thank you Jamaican Pot for being THE BEST!"
4 star rating,Great Food Great service! Plaintains were everything! Will definitely visit again. I had the chicken curry and it was a generous portion and very yummy. People usually put potatoes in them curry b less meat but this one was just meat only and I really appreciate it
5 star rating,"Very small place, one or two tables, can call order ahead. If you haven't had Jamaican food, spicy is like Thai spicy. Great portions and awesome sauce on the jerk chicken. Definitely recommend."
5 star rating,"So admittedly I have never had Jamaican food. My boyfriend and I were feeling adventurous so we decided to give this place a try after seeing good things about it online. We split a large meal with 3 different types of chicken, jerk, brown and barbecue. It also came with cabbage and plantains. I am sooo glad we gave this place shot, the food was excellent. Normally I'm not a fan of the flavor of cabbage but it was not as strong as I'm used to (and I mean that in a good way). I'm glad they have the option to choose different types of meat in a single dinner because we got to try different things without having to order too much. The whole point was to figure out which type of chicken would be our favorite...problem is it's all so good! We also decided to get some apple cobbler for dessert. Normally the crust is the worst part of the cobbler but even that was divine. Overall the meal was affordable, a large was enough to split between 2 people with leftovers. I would definitely recommend this place to others. So delicious!"
5 star rating,"So about a month and a half ago my husband and I were craving Jamaican food and our go to spot was closed for business and we couldn't find anything that compared..Yelp to the rescue!! My husband searches Jamaican food and Jamaican Pot is the first to pop up, since it's right down the street we decided to try it..He got the jerk chicken (Spicy) and I got the curry chicken (mild) and a beef patty.. I promise you I was so mad that we hadn't heard about this place sooner, the food was AMAZING!! Literally additive! The staff was awesome and spoke highly of the owner ""Mama Rose"", who I have gotten to know very well and I found out she is one on the sweetest people on earth, so humble and just happy to see people enjoying her food and her dream come to life.. I was just so completely impressed with the awesome customer service and to see the actual owner in the restaurant making sure thing's were running smoothly and every customer was happy was just icing on the delicious rum cake that is available there too!..So impressed that since I was looking for a job to replace the one I was currently working I asked for an application and I've now been her newest cashier for almost 3 months! :-)..This place is not only the most awesome place to get the most AUTHENTIC Jamaican food this side of the Caribbean but it's also quickly becoming one of the best places I've ever had the pleasure of working for!"
5 star rating,Love the food here!!! They used to cater at my work every Thursday and the lines were long and it always sold out. I've been to Jamaica twice on vacation and this place was better than I had on the Island. If you like jerk chicken you need to go here!!!
5 star rating,Nice new restaurant. The jerk chicken was well prepared. They were out of the homemade sorrel and ginger beer. Pretty solid for Michigan. I hope that they keep up the good work.
4 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place for a while. Ordered the triple chicken delight with jerk, curry and brown stew, and a beef patty. Everything was amazing. I wish I would have ordered more plantains and an extra beef patty! I can't wait to go back!!"
5 star rating,"Ever since the Jamaican Pot ceased operating out of the Culinary Studio in Southfield I've been impatiently waiting for them to find a new, permanent home and now they finally have.  Luckily, it's every bit as good as I remember.  The new digs are small, and while there are a few tiny tables it's really mostly a take-out place, which is fine by me.  I haven't been able to have Jamaican food on a regular basis since I lived around the corner from a Jamaican restaurant (now closed, sadly) many years ago in Ann Arbor, so I'm certainly no expert on the cuisine but I know I love this place. Everything I've had here is good, but it's the Jerk Chicken (hot please!) that I just can't get enough of.   The owners are friendly, the prices are reasonable and the food is plentiful.  The lunch specials are a particularly good deal, so it's been easy to justify the 15 minute trip from the office at least one a week.  Check them out!"
5 star rating,"I tried this restaurant out for the first time today. My wife and I enjoyed this outstanding food. Everything was excellent and the desserts are to die for. I can't remember her name but the cashier was very polite and hospitable, I was nervous about buying the sweet potato brownie because I never tried one. She gave me one FREE and it was GREAT! I'll recommend this place to anyone!"
5 star rating,Work in the area and just tried this restaurant.  Really enjoyed it.  Great service and food.  The chef/owner is a very nice cheerful lady.  Will def be goin back
4 star rating,"Saw the grand opening sign figured I'd give it a try. Menu was simple.Ordered the brown stew chicken,jerk chicken, curry chicken.. the establishment it was clean and orderly and the music was at a nice tone. My favorites were the brown stew chicken and the jerk, the curry was bland to me but my family liked it. I would definitely return for the brown stew chicken and the jerk chicken both were delicious. My Only request is for escovetich fish or different sides.but good Jamaican food you can find it here."
4 star rating,Portions are small for the price!! They use Boneless Chicken that's not original!!! I'll stick to the Caribbean Kitchen 200% better!!!
2 star rating,"This place is the bomb! The jerk chicken is flavorful and actually grilled. The jerk chicken is served boneless, that was unexpected, but fine by me. I ordered the spicy and it was SPICY. I think I'll get mild next time. I also had a beef patty which was good and the crust was flaky as it should be. I will definitely be back for more."
4 star rating,"This is my first time here (after rave recommendations from family members) and this place did not disappoint. I have eaten at several Jamaican places in Florida that are top notch and his place doesn't disappoint. We got the jerk chicken which comes with rice and beans, plantains, and cabbage slaw in large and it was enough for 2 people. The chicken is cut to smaller pieces, not whole parts like most places on Florida but that wasn't an issue. I'll be back to try other menu items. Pro tip: call to order in advance (about 20 minutes) because it's not fast food. The dishes are made to order."
5 star rating,Holy oxtails!!! I had no clue that Jamaican food was this tasty! First time having Jamaican food like oxtails and curry goat. My life has been lacking! Oxtails are like beef or neckbones and very yum. Spicy jerk definitely delivered the punch and the spice I would look for in Caribbean. The goat curry was tasty as well...it was my first time having so I have no point of reference but I definitely enjoyed the flavor and I'm usually not a fan of curry. It wasn't overpowering at all. I liked the plantains and cabbage...that definitely balanced out the spices with the sweet. I also ordered a beef patty and coco bread for 20 bucks. It was well worth every penny! The counter girls are pretty friendly. The second time I had the $4 lunch special of jerk chicken. Perfect portion for that price and a small lunch. I will definitely be getting that again. I'm so disappointed that it took me this long to find this place!  :)
5 star rating,"Let me tell y'all something. I put a lot of people on this place. It's, amazing. Always ask if they have chicken patties, if they do, grab em they're great. I typically get the curry chicken because their curry chicken is incredible. My friends all get the jerk, mild spice."
5 star rating,Best Jamaican food around. Everytime I go I get a great meal. You can tell they take pride in what they do. That's making homemade Jamaican food. They keep coming up  with new dishes like the pepper steak which is my favorite. I haven't tried the jerk chicken chop suey yet I have heard good things about it. That will be my next adventure. Don't forget the cornbread so moist it will melt in your mouth.
5 star rating,"Delicious food. Only complaint was that they but BBQ flavor on the jerk chicken. The rice is perfect, not overseasoned like so many other places. I'll be back (:"

3 star rating,"Ordered 2 large dinners 7 March, veggie dinner and Bob Marley stew. Both were 10.95. I was shocked when I got home and looked at the vegetarian meal to find all it had was some cabbage and rice, with four small pieces of plantain. When I called the restaurant I indicated that the menu reads cabbage, carrots, and other veggie(s). The cashier proceeded to tell me it only has cabbage and rice with plantain. That is not 10.95! I spent $24.00 for what I thought would be a great veggie experience, not even. Eaten here before and enjoyed food but this leaves a bad taste."
4 star rating,"the food was fresh and delicious!  the lunch jerk chicken cost $3.99 and was plenty for a lunch portion coming with plantain, beans and rice, and jerk chicken.  and, the beef patty is $2 and delicious!only down side is the space.  not really set up to eat in but great for carry out.  delicious food, friendly service, and great prices, i will definitely be back."
4 star rating,"Been going here for a few months now. Every time the food is amazing. Service is perfect.. wished they stayed open a little later but it's fine. Whenever I catch it, it's always good.. authentic Jamaican!!"
5 star rating,"If you're in a hurry, this may not be the place for you. Food takes a while even when I call in HOWEVER; that isn't a bad thing because once you get your food it is SO worth the wait. I haven't had a bad dish yet and the curry chicken patty is the best I've had without physically being in Jamaica. I'm a fan...maybe a groupie even."
5 star rating,"Was sent here and had the brown stew king fish, a patty and some curry chicken. The fish was good but the sauce was more like bbq sauce than brown stew, the chicken curry which was aight and the patty was nicely cooked. The service was really nice though, very warm and welcoming. I'd go back."
3 star rating,"I am so happy we made the drive it was so worth it. We ordered ox tails,bbq chicken,jerk chicken and curried goat dinners.  Every thing was top notch. I can't wait to come here again!"
5 star rating,My wife's Jamaican and she said it's the real deal. We got spicy  Jerk Chicken. The spice is perfect and the rice and peas were great.
5 star rating,"Curried goat is what ordered. I had the goat when the restaurant was on Northwestern Hwy. The pieces of meat was not chopped as small as it is now but the taste is the same. The portion of goat, rice and beans and cabbage was generous. The portion of plantain was very small, only 4 small pieces even though I  asked for more and she said she would put in more pieces. There should be at least 6 pieces. Overall the meal was very satisfying. I wished they had a dine restaurant too."
4 star rating,Great food and great service. Everything is fresh but the food has come fairly quickly in my experiences. I've had the jerk chicken and brown stew chicken.
5 star rating,"This place is AMAZING! The food is fresh and perfectly flavored and balanced. If you love authentic Jamaican food, this is the place to go. We had their Jamaican Jerk Chicken with rice, plantains, and cabbage. The large portion was great for sharing for two plus a few beef patties were just a perfect meal. The chicken tasted great and very spicy (granted we ordered the extra spicy) but in a very good way. It's spicy without destroying the flavor overall. You'll start sweating but you can't stop eating it. The beef patties were phenomenal from the flavor of the beef to the flaky crust. I've had Jamaican patties in other countries and in Jamaica and I could tell these are authentic and not a mediocre version of Jamaican food. The rum cake brownie was delicious as well. The owner was so sweet to let us taste a huge sample of it. If I wasn't so full, I'd probably order an entire plate of it and eat it. We were also able to have a sample of the curry chicken. The flavor was fantastic and smooth. It wasn't spicy which is a great contrast to the jerk chicken. The chicken in both dishes were very tender and good quality. I think I'll order a full order of the curry chicken next time I come back along with an order of the jerk. Yes, it's that amazing! Customer service was awesome and very hospitable even if the location might turn off people who live in the suburbs. But I must tell you... Their food and their smiles are so worth the trip down to 8 mile. I'm definitely coming back and telling my friends about it."

4 star rating,"I have been here several times and the majority of the times, I enjoy my meals. However the oxtails are Very skimpy for the price so I will not be getting those ever again."
3 star rating,However the lunch special is deceiving they say that there is only a large or a small size dish during lunch but the large is really a medium. When I first went to this restaurant the portions were a nice size but lately they seem to be smaller today I waited for over an hour for their cornbread and was not even offered an extra napkin for the inconvenience.  I would strongly recommend calling ahead to make sure they have everything before you arrive
3 star rating,"This place is a diamond in the rough. Delicious food and large portions for a decent price. The curry, jerk, and bbq chicken are all delicious. The cabbage I could eat all day. Not to mention the owner is the sweetest woman! You can tell she takes great pride in her food!"
5 star rating,The food was absolutely excellent!  I ordered jerk chicken an got coca bread! Now im hooked! The best Jamaican food so far!
5 star rating,"In the past few months they have been opened at the present location, I have visited this restaurant three times.  Each time, I ordered the jerk chicken; each time it was delicious. The plantain, beans/rice and cabbage sides were also very good. The restaurant owner and staff are very pleasant and deliver excellent service.  This restaurant is a great one to try."
