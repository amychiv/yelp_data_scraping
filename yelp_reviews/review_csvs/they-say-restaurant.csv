3.5 star rating,"This place was so good! Waited a bit long for service the waiter kept saying he'd be right with us but kept tending to other tables. The tenders were fall off the imaginary bone good  and don't let me start on their they say sauce. Just mwaah! cant really remember the drink name but it had Black Hennessy, pretty good just not a dark drinker. Went at 10pm on a weekday! Will definitely be back!!"
5 star rating,"Great customer service, but drinks trash food selection limited and just wasn't appetizing ordered a they say trio chicken quesadillas weren't done just too much cheese and they say nachos .. they should rename it Starters because it was good start but won't be back and still hungry"
2 star rating,Nice music beautiful decor great food me and my husband visited in January it was so nice
5 star rating,We sat at the bar first the manager/owner was amazing made sure we got a table and drinks. We ordered our appetizers then the waitress never came back for our orders and we stopped another waitress to order(glasses with a blue tint).. she was super annoyed and was really rude. Had it not been for the rest of our party i would have left .. there was another women in our party that felt the same way. The same waitress even was arguing on the floor with a man on speaker phone about calling her so much and was yelling back and forth.. another waitress grabbed her because everyone was looking at this point... she was even annoyed with the waitress telling her that everyone was looking. Legit some of the worst service i have ever had at any restaurant ever... i mean no refills no one coming back to check if our food was good.. had to even go get the checks.. it was not by any means busy. I mean the waitress was rolling her eyes and everything.. the reviews on this restaurant are legit true.. i thought maybe they were exaggerated. Definitely not the case! The food was great. The steak bites were amazing and the sweet potato fries were prolly the best I've ever had! The wings were on point and the turkey chops looked amazing i felt like i was missing out by not ordering them(someone else's plate). If i had to come here i would sit at the bar! No wonder everyone was trying to sit there and not a table.
2 star rating,I've been here a few times. The food is okay. My service was good. I ordered the corned beef sandwich with a side of veggies. I found it weird that they wanted me to put my mask on every time my waitress came to my table. Most restaurants let you take it off once seated.The tables were spread far enough to practice safe social distancing. They don't have virtual menus. All of the staff wore masks.
4 star rating,Loved the turkey chop options and the ambiance was nice. Unfortunately with staffing shortage service was a bit slow. Wanted extra gravy never received.
4 star rating,Food was tasty. Lamb chops and catfish were seasoned well. They didn't have the red velvet cheesecake! Oh we got the wings and they were cooked well and sauce was delish!
3 star rating,This place has a wonderful vibe.  The food selection is really good - which includes their staple of chicken wings.  The restaraunt and bar both are a nice hang out spot. Great networking. You can even rent the upstairs for parties ...
5 star rating,"highly recommend this trendy restaurant right by the Detroit riverfront and Aretha franklin arena! I'm fairly picky when it comes to hospitality and their service was top notch! we had Raphael as our server and he was super attentive and friendly; we also met the general manager (can't remember her name but she was very welcoming and I always love to see a woman GM!) great food and drink options for super reasonable prices; although they didn't have many vegetarian meal options, I found plenty of options to make a meal out of sides. my party of three had drinks, meals & desserts for about $60 total- an absolute score for city dining!"
5 star rating,Good vibes! Good food! I went to the downtown location and had a great experience with my boo. The customer service was great and the chicken was on point! Don't forget to order the bread pudding because you will definitely thank me later!
3.5 star rating,"I was in a group of about 9pm and arrived a few minutes before the kitchen closed down. It was very long day working the Growler Gallop race at Atwater, and we were ready for a decent meal. These awesome folks kept the kitchen open, and provided top notch service. The Fried Chicken Sandwich and Fries was very good, and the Catfish Bites too. We all sat at the bar, and had an awesome time. I would highly recommend this place. These guys truly know how to provided an excellent customer experience, with great food and drinks."
5 star rating,"Fantastic food and experience here. My pork chop was perfect, juicy and properly seasoned. Bread pudding was other worldly."
5 star rating,"20 minute wait but were seated in half the time.I love cocktail menus at restaurants, but here they will just make whatever you ask for.My friend ordered the wings and received a legendary portion. She also received fries when she really ordered onion rings. The onion rings came after we got our bill.I ordered the ribeye which had more fat than expected. The veggies also seemed to be the steamed grocery store bag kind and not fresh."
4 star rating,The food was amazing....I strongly recommend the Cajun Chicken Pasta and the Carrot Cake.
5 star rating,"It's one of three restaurants on the street. They Say always seems fun with live music on Monday nights. Music was super loud but we were beepin back and forth to it. Music was real good. Service was real bad. I think our servicer name was Stephany. She didn't tell us- the receipt did. Some of the food was cold. The salmon was dry. The wings were really good. The They Say sauce- was made with love. The seafood dip was yum other than that- everything was cold or dry. Super disappointing. The waitress grabbed all the tops of the waters with her fingers- and opened my beer with her hand. I don't know with the flu going around and other health concerns I was really unhappy with the lack of attention and consideration our server had. I think she rolled her eyes four times I only saw one but my girlfriend caught the other three.We had to ask for items a couple different times like napkins or refills on our drinks or tarter sauce for the cat fish but when it finally came the cat fish was eaten. Anyways- They Say prolly was good at one point in time. The bartender was very sweet. Hopefully it turns around.The music was awesome where that in itself would be fun to go back- maybe- I don't know- Naw after a short moment to reflect that's safe They Say, Sad to Say, its our first and last time to visit."
2 star rating,First sit down meal since COVID-19 hit and I must admit the service/enthusiasm was just not what I expected after months of take outs and eating at home. My wings were on point and the signature jumbo shrimp meal was a little over cooked but definitely still edible. The tables were spaced well for social distancing. They Say has always been one of my Riverfront favs so I'm not counting them out....I'll Be Back...lol
3 star rating,"I ordered a delivery order and it seems like every time I order they forget something. Some of the food is amazing like the pasta for example and some of it is just bland and tasteless like the nachos. Wouldn't go back, food was ok but too pricey for what I get."
1 star rating,"there are only two reasons to eat here:  you're beyond your ""i can't go any further and must eat NOW"" moment and nothing else is open.the worst of the delivered by a giant truck from some commercial processed food place somewhere on the planet.  in addition, of the three sandwiches ordered, all three were thoroughly over cooked and dry beyond redemption.  as for the staff, exceedingly friendly and knowledgeable, great crew.  this place is being added to my ""never, ever, return to this joint and warn friends.""  yuk."
2 star rating,Food is good bar food with some classier options. Atmosphere is dope with a bar surrounding TVs playing the sports games and plenty of table seating. Stars were lost because of the service; specifically at the bar. Bar was pretty full but the bartender was not remotely equipped to handle the traffic. Visibly flustered and killing the vibe of a laid back sports/social bar experience. This attitude was given to both other guests and myself. The service was so subpar I want to rate 3 stars but the food and the atmosphere beyond the bartender were so good that this place does deserve more. Just train that bartender please or staff two people when the bar is full. Gordon Ramsay would have a few things to say about the service for sure.
4 star rating,I'll be very specific!!The food was very bland (no flavor)The staff took 30 mins to bring us (a party of 3) water. I ordered catfish bites and wish I hadn't honestly(no flavor). The seafood dip had again no flavor. The chicken wings had been over cooked the salmon was as well. I waited until my friends food was done before receiving my own entree (to eat alone ‍I'm giving 2 stars because the parking is free and the playlist (music) was 90's R&B.
3.5 star rating,"They Say was a great experience! it was around 10:20pm Wednesday when we walked in... not too many patrons but the staff was happy and ready to serve us! India, was our waitress and she had great energy with a smile on the whole time! We split an order of the wings, which were AMAZING!! He got the catfish, and I got the salmon with veggies and rice! Our whole meal was amazing and tasted like ""home cooking""! We will definitely be back!"
5 star rating,"Here is one business that should not reopen! Customer service is non-existent! Food at best is average, they need to go into a business where they do not engage with the public."
1 star rating,"The food is OK... it's hit or miss but the thing that stands out most is the customer service! Staff is very rude and act as if they don't want to work, half of the time they are giving attitude. When I tried to call an order the phone just rings and rings and no one picks up so i had to drive all the way there just to place an order (so inconvenient).... while I was in there placing the order another customer came in and he been calling for over 45 mins and there is no answer, the person doing carry out said it rings in the front. So if the phone rings in the front then why is carry out in the back? This place really need to get it together because customer service like this makes people not want to patronize the business. This isn't the first instance of this rude service and I doubt it will be the last. How do they expect people to come here when theyA. Don't answer the phone and B.. have a bad attitude. I don't think it's been a time that I've been here and service was good because every time I've came it's been horrible. Today was the final time and I'll never give my money to this establishment again!"
1 star rating,"My family and I were seated within about 10min on a Friday night,  it appeared to be only 1 waitress working   that's not okay on a Friday night.   I wouldn't have not  minded waiting but the waitress was not friendly,  didn't smile nor did she make any eye contact.   Then our food finally came to the table after an extremely long wait.   The lamb chops were cold along with everything else on the plate.  A salad was also  ordered with grilled salmon on top......the salmon nearly raw couldn't be eaten. This was my first and last visit to this place,  the kitchen and wait staff need to be taken out out service and trained properly.   A.S.A.P"
1 star rating,"The wings were excellent the They Say sauce was better than the sweet chilli sauce but both were good. Everytime I come I'm going to order the wings with the They Say sauce cause it was excellent. The catfish nuggets were also really good however, they did have large pieces of bones in them."
4 star rating,"We went here after a concert at Sound Board. It was recommended by one of the people in the group. It is a busy spot located off of Jefferson. Parking....not good. I found a spot on a side street but there is also a structure you can park in. There is a bar in entering and various areas that you can be seated in.  It is a lively spot. I placed my name The wait was long. We were told to make our way to the back and wait. There were couches and a TV which made it better. There are various things on the menu from shrimp, steak, sandwiches and chicken. I ordered the Chicken wing appetizer and the rib tips. The wings with the special hot bbq sauce was finger livking good. The rib tips....ahhh not so much. They were just ok. It was a little slow. The waitress was attentive and good. I would visit again one day if in the area."
4 star rating,"I work nearby and go here about once a month.  Their lunch specials are delicious and fresh and only $7 with a drink included!   I get the burger and it's always amazing.  Chicken Pot Pie soup is great, too!  My only complaint is that they could use some non-starch sides to sub with the specials!While waitstaff is great and attentive, it takes awhile to get your food.  The kitchen area looks tiny and it's my guess that it's the food being prepared that's actually holding up the process.  I'm almost always rushing back to work so i'm not late...and that's with ordering food as soon as we sit down and asking for/paying the bill when the food is brought out.  For this reason, we don't go as often as we'd like.  Also, if you pay cash and don't have exact change, don't expect to get your coin change back!"
3 star rating,"I actually went to the New Location in Harper Woods ((in front of the Old Eastland Mall))The location just opened 3weeks ago, is in a nice spot.. we stumbled across the location by accident but I'm sure glad we did on Wednesday they have Karaoke ((FUN!)) And of course the Infamous ""They Say Wings!"" I only ordered a drink but Absolutely enjoyed the people watching."
4 star rating,I use to love They Say but things have changed. The staff (waitresses and bartenders) are still great but the food has fallen off considerable.
2 star rating,"We came here today after the memorial service for our dear relative.There were 8 of us and we were seated promptly. I'm not from the area,  but everything looked delicious. I ordered the salmon croquettes and jasmine rice.  It came with a tasty sauce. My raspberry tea was the best I've ever had.  Everyone enjoyed their food.Our waitress was very kind and super efficient.  I'm sorry I don't remember her name."
3.5 star rating,"We were traveling thru and staying on our boat at WG Milliken Harbor. A local mariner suggested ""They Say "" restaurant. It was an easy safe walk from the marina. I'm so glad we took his advice! The fried chicken sandwich was probably the best I have had. Not greasy, a juicy fried breast served with fresh crisp lettuce, tomatoes and onion slices, and the sweet potatoes fries were pure heaven. The wings my husband ordered were meaty, juicy and offered in good portion sizes. The lady sitting next to me had a plate of lovely lamb chops that looked totally yummy. The difference that really put the experience into a higher category however, was the service. From the moment we walked in, we felt welcome. We were greeted, our server came quickly with a smile and introduced himself. We were checked on regularly and the billing came without delay when we determined we were finished.  The washrooms were clean. Thank you, They Say. It was a delightful experience."
5 star rating,"Lamb chops!  Look at this picture.... need I say more?They were ""gnaw-on-the-bone"" GOOD!"
4 star rating,"I'm changing my tune about They Say because the last time a friend and I went to pick up carryout, we were COMPLETELY IGNORED for about 5 minutes until we addressed the host directly. Even though we had been there several times (we work across the street) she obviously didn't want to speak to us. She then proceeded to walk away never to return. After 10 more minutes, we planted ourselves at the bar hoping to get service there. Not so much. The bartender looked right at us and it was only after we told her what we needed without being asked that she went to retrieve our food from the kitchen. Really? I mean, it's carryout. You grab a bag and hand it over. Unacceptable. I got a very negative feeling from the staff for no apparent reason, and I will NOT be returning, despite the decent food. My friend and I are ""less melanated"" people, and I got the feeling that this was the reason for our mistreatment. They've never been this rude before, and my only explanation is that we were with ""more melanated"" people those times. Listen. Perhaps many whities can be jerks, but we are not them. We tip well. We smile and ask nicely. Perhaps we had to pay that day for all the mistreatment that had come before us from other ""less melanated"" patrons, and I get it, but this will be the last time we go there. That's a lot of dollars lost from the ladies who lunch right across the street."
1 star rating,"I work right across the street from this Riverfront restaurant, so I really hoped it would be good. I'll definitely be returning, but haven't tried enough to go out of my way. I've seen my colleagues order their salads, which are generous and fresh, but some better greens would be nice, and they're a little on the expensive side if you order meat on them. ($12) I ordered the Terry burger and sweet potato fries. The fries were tasty but a bit soft, and the burger is like a BBQ burger with BBQ sauce and hand-battered onion straws. The patty was hand-formed, lean and pretty flavorful. Could have used a bit more salt. The bun was a good bakery variety, and they cooked it to my specifications. Will I return? Yes. And apparently, they have great karaoke."
4 star rating,This place is an entire joke. First experience wasn't so hot. But TODAY...I can't even begin to explain how disgusting this restaurant is. I must say the mixed vegetables are probably the best mixed vegetables in Detroit. & I'm not big on veggies. But how is it that the mixed vegetables are dang near the best thing on the menu. I also ordered catfish bites and mashed potatoes and I'm very disappointed. The mashed potatoes have no flavor and the catfish bites just taste weird. I feel like I'm in the hospital on one of those hospital diets. Okay I'm done. The environment is great but the food is beyond disappointing.
2 star rating,"Been here twice. Once for a co-worker and then today scouting for Xmas Party places for the company.  Prices are average to high. But food is good. I found nothing I wanted on the menu tho, but ended up getting the trio with Catfish Nuggets, They Say Wings, and Chicken Quesadillas. And an order of fries. It's 13 bucks. Server was quick and nice enough. Best thing was the wings and the quesadilla. Although I enjoyed the fries which are similar to rallys fries with that coating. I'd come again, I enjoy the atmosphere."
3 star rating,"Before the Yelp event on Belle Isle we stopped in to get a drink.. It was about 95 outside and 85 in the bar. We sat for a bit before we got service but what she lacked in the beginning she made up for! I got a $5 margarita for happy hour and I told her to make it strong, man she didn't disappoint! I'm usually a extra shot of tequila on the side type girl but she really hit the nail on the head with the margarita!! We also got potato skins to help my ulcer not absorb all the alcohol I'd be consuming as the night rolled on. As we sat there a ""regular"" came in and we struck up a conversation. She told us that it's usually pretty cool in here so something must be going on!! But, she also said the food was excellent. The skins were decent. Never know what to expect, ya know? I think besides the air being non-existent it was great! Seemed to be a local hot spot and everyone was great! I will definitely come back..Only con: Parking! It can be a bit difficult but it was even that bad. Just can be tricky!!"
4 star rating,Always A Great Time @ They Say!!!Nice vibe... great choice after a Chene Park concert.  Bartenders have heavy hands.  Never disappointing dishes.  Reasonably priced food and drinks.  Parking lots accommodate customers. Well lit with security.
4 star rating,"Giving a 4 because it's a Great place to eat before a concert at Chene Park, clean, food is solid, & happy hour drinks are strong. However, service can be slow and after 7pm expect a wait. Parking lot is very small, but there is a small lot on the next block or street parking is free. A Detroit staple, I'll continue to patron They Say."
4 star rating,"I hate to say it, but They Say is falling off. The famous they say wings were just wings in sauce. No seasoning at all. The sauce does not taste the same either.  Then we ordered the lobster mac and cheese. The lobster had a weird salty/sour taste to it. I don't want to say the lobster is sour or old, but the lobster tasted salty and old. Thus used to be one of my favorite places to eat, but um, I won't be back for a minute."
2 star rating,The wings are delicious! I came after a graduation. The place was packed. My food came out fast considering the amount of people that was there. I will return for the wings.
3.5 star rating,"We walked in and there were two tables with people and the rest empty.  We were told the wait is an hour...  No way.  At least tell us that the tables were reserved or something.  It was a weekday and super unlikely the tables were reserved.  Best guess:  they didn't like the color of our skin.  Reading the reviews, sounds like it worked out for the best."
1 star rating,They say... is a great place to eat. The service is Excellent!  You are welcomed and the food is great.  They have the best wings I love the sweet chilli wings. The salmon croquette is delicious.
5 star rating,The location at Eastland mall was great. They were slow and the waiter needs to check in on customers more often. I hate waiving my hand. The girl behind the bar needs to stop eating in front of customers wait until ur break plz. That was unprofessional to serve drinks while eating. ‍
3 star rating,My husband had the Lamb chops. He really enjoyed them. They were well seasoned and flavorful. The service was great and my order was ready when I arrived. We are definitely going to return!
5 star rating,"We came for a birthday dinner.  The staff seemed surprised we were here despite the 25 person reservation.We asked for the drink menu and they didn't have one, but claimed they had a full bar.  I asked if they could make a caramel apple martini using butterscotch schnapps and they said no.  My friend asked for a Jolly Rancher and they couldn't make it.  The water tasted metallic so I didn't get a drink at all.  We tried to order shrimp and grits.  But were told they didn't have any and that it was being taken off of the menu.  So, I ordered the catfish.  The catfish was served hot and bland.  There was no real seasoning in the fish.  I decided to take it home because with enough tarter sauce my 6 year old will eat it.  Overall, a very disappointing visit and I won't come back.Now I need to find dinner."
1 star rating,Note: we are at the Harper Woods location-Food is supposed to be good here. Wouldn't know yet we have been waiting for our food for over 30 minutes. Better be worth the wait. Waitress says they are short staffed in the kitchen.
2 star rating,This place is awesome! I loved the vibes. The drinks were super cheap and strong...how they should be. The staff were friendly and quick. I only ate some of the appetizers and I can say they were solid. What you would expect for bar apps. The atmosphere is what truly made this place a must visit again.
4 star rating,"This restaurant was recommended and it met the recommendations. I truly enjoyed the look from the outside to the inside with the exclusion of the parking but I will take it or your but may need up on parking enforcement of Detroit. Lol! I liked the semi circle booth with the view of the outside, if you are like me what to see what's happening on the outside as well as the inside. I like the fact they had a full bar with great food. Our waitress, Jade, was very tentative with supplying all requests of everyone's orders and bring it hot to the touch and tastes of every item delicious. It was a pleasure to dine and relax. Oh, let me not forget they have t.v. for the sports fans and the bathrooms were decent to use. A must try!"
4 star rating,"Came here for a Friday dinner and it was a little crowded but we were able to be seated as soon as we arrived. The atmosphere was family oriented and relaxed. They were playing great music lots of 90s R&B and classic soul. It took our a waitress some time to get to us even for a crowded restaurant, and she did apologized which was good that she recognized it. They have happy hour until 9, and some basic drinks but a good selection of familiar well drinks and domestic beers on special. I ordered the onion rings grilled shrimp and that coleslaw one of the great things about this place is that they have homemade tartar sauce the tartar sauce which is a must have. Thr slaw is very good as well it has a tangy flavor. They gave me a lot of shrimp and the meal was very filling, the onion rings were fried to perfection and the onions did not pull out when I ate them. The only issue I had was the service was slow however I will come back because the food was very good."
3 star rating,"The atmosphere of this place is nice but the food leaves more to be desired. The food is decent, but overpriced for the quality. Why am I paying $8 for GFS chicken tenders that don't come with fries?! The They Say burger is good, but who wants to get a burger all the time? Also, if you can't make a decent burger, those front doors need to be locked permanently! I've ordered the salad, it was drenched in dressing. I had to search for the lettuce beneath my pool of caesar dressing. Maybe it would be better with dressing on the side. All hope isn't lost, the bartenders make great drinks and once patrons are tipsy, they won't notice how mediocre the food is. Lower the prices and prepare better food, period."
3.5 star rating,"Started out with THE rudist waitress reprimanding my husband and I for not visiting the hostess stand before we sat down. Turns out there were people standing in front of the ""Please wait to be seated"" sign. So we simply did not see it.While debating whether to leave or stay, a  waiter came . Raphael. He was very professional while patiently covering drink and menu items. We enjoyed the food and just happened to hear a live band that was great! Can't recommend because I can't guarantee Raphael will be there to serve others. Seems we were fortunate."
4 star rating,"So I put in a carry out order at 11:10am the lady said that it will be 25min and I was cool with that but now it's 11:50 and for some reason or another my wings are finally done buuuuuuut where the hell is my salmon the cook is busy singing  Luther Vandross here and now so now that I get the bill they at 11:55am and my salmon is finally done after almost an hour they don't have change for a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL!!! ?????? All I'm gonna say is the cooking BET NOT BE JUST AS BAD AS THE COOKS SINGING SKILLS, because his singing skills are"
1 star rating,"This is one of my go to spots.  I love meeting friends here, dining and drinking at the bar!!! The They Say wings (hot ) are my favorite."
4 star rating,"Decent food, but service is always crappy no matter what time of the day, or day of week. Yesterday, waitress never came back to give us refills, appetizers and food came at the same time, out of menu items, waited 10 minutes after our food to get silverware. The list really goes on. The only thing that is consistently good is the food. Everything is always tasty, but service really needs to be upped to make this place outstanding. I know people who loves this place, and I come with them, but it's not my first choice"
2 star rating,"I didn't even know this restaurant existed until it was suggested by a friend so she and I had lunch here.  Their Wing's are amazing.  Seriously, I can't remember anything else we had.  I will definitely return for those wings.  The service was a little slow and not many tables were occupied, but our waitress was friendly."
3 star rating,"The food is good, not gonna lie. But the service is terrible ! I mean terrible. The waiters only come check on you like you're supposed to if you're a table full of men. And the drinks are bad. I don't know if they hire actual bartenders....u know bartenders that were trained. The drinks are horrible. Food is good, service is terrible !"
3 star rating,"The New York strip was AMAZING! The fries are wonderful also. Great vibes, great non-stop music and the staffed seemed very nice. I had very nice waitress. Kudos. God bless."
4 star rating,"They Say is centrally located very close to downtown Detroit, near the Detroit River. It's a great place to go before a Chene Park concert. I love the wings and I think the sampler with quesadillas, wings, and potato skins for around $11 is a great deal. Sometimes it gets super busy in this place, and orders can get mixed up. Be sure to be precise when ordering your meal. This is not the place for you if you're impatient. Some nights, you'll find there is a fantastic entertainer/tremendously talented human playing an instrument or singing some jazzy tunes. If this is your bag, be sure to call ahead and see what kind of entertainment may be in store for your visit. Pro tip: Take a walk on the Detroit River before or after dinner to really wow your date, if you come here with a significant other. They Say is a hidden gem in a quiet corner of the city.Update: I can't go here and NOT order wings. Also, the bread pudding is boss."
4 star rating,This is for the Harper Woods location. Terrible. My husband ordered a Long Beach and they brought him a Long Island. We explained the difference and the bar tender simply gave him a glass of cranberry juice to mix the drink himself. What kind of customer service is this? I pay you to mix my own drink? Ridiculous. Never again.
1 star rating,"Since this was my first time experiencing Detroit as a visitor to the NBMBAA Conference.    I enjoyed the atmosphere, food, drinks and revitalization of your city.  Great find recommended by my local brothers and sistahs."
3.5 star rating,"Haven't eaten here, but the food looks amazing. The people in my group all loved their food and reported it's consistent every time they come. They had the game on, which was nice, and the drinks were strong. I would like to get more in my glass for the money they charge for mixed drinks though."
3 star rating,Tried several times to contact the GM (Pamela Charles)to reserve for my birthday (in December) and she never responded.  Very poor customer service.  I WILL NOT be eating @ that establishment!!!
1 star rating,"Wings are the bomb. Drinks are so good and the bartenders are the bomb! Love this place. My husband couldn't believe how good the wings are. He's definitely in love with this place, we both are."
5 star rating,"They Say is a great spot for whatever kind of night you're looking to have.  It can be perfect for a meal with a group of friends,  a fun and flirty date night,  or just chilling and having a drink by yourself.  Good food, trendy urban atmosphere, hot R&B music on the speakers (sometimes a live band), and either dressed up or casual you'll fit in fine.  The service can be slow, but the food makes up for it.  It's off of Jefferson, close enough to downtown to be a perfect start or end to a night on the town, but far away from the hustle and bustle that you won't have to fight for parking."
4 star rating,The last two times I have been here the waitress service has absolutely sucked. When you have to ask another waitress for a refill of water or for a box or check that is absolutely poor customer service! And both times it wasn't even that busy! The food is amazing but they certainly need to retrain their wait staff or simply get more waitresses....!!
1 star rating,"Terrible! Terrible!! Terrible!!! Our waitress was provided the worst service ever.  If Katrinna is your waitress be prepared to wait five minutes and 40 minutes or more for your food.  She stood over of me while I signed the receipt...Needless to say she got no tip.  I tipped the nice guy waiter since he was more interested in providing service to our table.OH the food.  They Say wings were just okay, mediocre.  Fried shrimps a bit doughy but had good flavor.  Flood's has better fried shrimp.  Lamb chops were dry and fried entirely to hard.  I'll never come back to this restaurant again."
1 star rating,"Seriously, can you just take the shrimp and grits off the menu if you aren't going to make them anymore? It's highlighted in red, like it's special or something. I still loved the Salmon Croquettes, but a little less cheese on my potato would have been better."
3 star rating,"What a wonderful experience. From the delicious food to the super nice service, I can't wait to return for more. I even told some friends that it's a must visit spot. Lastly the decor, music, and people added to our group's wonderful night."
5 star rating,"Let me start by saying I wish I was having lunch here right now! My wife and I called in a carryout order while visiting the Atwater Brewery nearby. The food was incredibly good (I especially loved the catfish nuggets), and the staff was very welcoming and friendly as I waited to pick up my order.Next time I'm in Detroit I'd really like to go back and dine in, and maybe even check out some live music here."
5 star rating,"Ive been going to ""They Say"" for awhile, usually for poetry on Thursday nites. J-Bell (the host) is HILARIOUS!   Get there early if you want a decent seat (like 8ish). There is a $5 charge (just upstairs for the open mic) but I don't mind supporting J and his wife Peace, they are both great host and even better performers. ""They Say"" signature wings are delicious  lol (thats all I order). I had a martini once, it was good and strong...though alil on the small side. Food and drink orders can be alil slow at times. Wait staff is polite. One day I'll stay and hang out downstairs ."
3.5 star rating,"Loved my wings. Excited to come back and try more stuff. Everything coming out of the kitchen looked great. I sat at the bar, bar manager waited on us, she was excellent. Neat place!"
5 star rating,"Went on a ""date"" here about 2 weeks ago. Enjoyed my Moscow Mule and the salmon Caesar salad I ordered. Absolutely delicious! As I sat with my ""date"" glazed over with Mule kicking in I realized, I'm never going out with him again. Thanks to They Say and the mule for putting me back in focus"
4 star rating,"Nice joint in the neighborhood.  This place is almost like two spots in one.  As you enter, you are presented with a large bar area, that is jumping with nice beats, the other half of the building is a large open dining area with kitchen serving as a nice backdrop.  The service was decent, and the drinks were on point.  Great place for dinner and a drink, low key, especially considering its only a few blocks from home."
3 star rating,"The wings here are really really food. I highly suggest you order them! As for everything else, it was fine. But those wings tho! Service was a bit slow but not the worst I've ever gotten. None of the staff was overwhelmingly friendly to say the least. It's worth a shot!"
4 star rating,"Yelp, Said it was open on Monday's.  Went on  Memorial Day but no sign on the door noting closed after checking a few times after 11 to see maybe if hours were wrong on Yelp and Facebook.  Would check out place again just to see and we liked the area to revisit.  They need to post sign or on Facebook.   Ended up having a wonderful visit at Atwater Brewery, great lunch and awesome service that more than made up for time lost checking back here.   Definitely will go back there.  System forced me to put stars on, can say bad because of that and not tasting their food,  so I put 3 stars as neutral."
3 star rating,"i really didn't enjoy myself...the food was mediocre as well as the service, however they environment wasn't horrible. i ordered the potato skins and they weren't the horrible, but they most definitely weren't great. all in all, they weren't good and i wouldn't recommend."
1 star rating,"Mid Sunday afternoon we were in the D and looking for a brew so we decided to stop in at Atwater Brewery.  They looked closed. As we were heading back up Joseph Campau, we saw the sign for They Say and the lights were on.  Time for some Urban Exploring! The interior was beautiful! Nice restoration and paint color selection. The bartender was really nice and attentive. The beer at the bar was way cheap.  They had a decent variety (including local DBC's Alt), with the most expensive being $4 a glass. Not bad. We got the They Say Wings with They Say barbeque sauce. Delicious!  The wings were very meaty and the portion size (10) was fulfilling. The huge flat screens over the bar were each showing a different NFL game.  What a good place to catch a game.They Say was a great find on the perfect Sunday afternoon!"
4 star rating,They Say was a great experience. Staff was attentive and food was great! Especially the wings!!!
5 star rating,"The food is good however the service does not match! They aren't expedient at all with getting your food to you (for carry out) and get kinda snarky if you make a comment regarding that issue. I work in customer service, so the staff can sometimes be a make or break when deciding to revisit. Basically, They Say needs to train their employees more in the art of hospitality!On a more positive note, the They Say wings are pretty good, along with the taco bowl when fried correctly."
2 star rating,The Harper Woods location. I went last night 6/28/19 and the band was the BEST!! I would return to hear them play. The service and food I can do without. The young man helping us was very nice. They had him covering  ALL the tables in that section. When my food came 90% of it was cold. No condiments were on the table and by the time he got back to the table the rest of my food was cold. My bill was 80 dollars!!! Not worth eight.
3.5 star rating,Great atmosphere and the service was awesome - very attentive!  The steak bites were delicious!
5 star rating,"I was here this evening around 8:30ish.  Even though it was busy, we were seated immediatly but after being ignored for about 15 minutes, we left.  One waitress kept walking by us.  One time she told us someone was coming but no one came.  There was a lot of finger pointing at us but no one ever came to take our order.  SMH"
1 star rating,"The food was good. They definitely gave large servings. Our server was excellent at entertaining us with conversation. She was super cool. The jazzy theme was also really cool. Even better was the music! It was really difficult to seat a table of 9, so if you have large parties, this might not be the place for you. Also, the server was hesitant to split tabs, but eventually did anyway. It was confusing. Overall, the staff seemed nice and willing to work with us. I would definitely come back!"
3 star rating,Stopped in for a quick lunch at the bar. Wings and cheese sticks were delicious and the bartender was attentive and super friendly. Would definitely recommend.
4 star rating,"This is one of my favorite places in Detroit. When my friends and I moved here from VA back in 2012, we'd come here every Thursday for the Open Mic Night and Wings. The food here is excellent!  It's the perfect balance of great food and music. During the weekend, it's jam packed and loud. Be prepared for a long wait if you don't have reservations."
5 star rating,"I have had the pleasure of eating here twice and both times I was extremely satisfied. I've tried the they say wings and the sauce was sweet and delicious. I also tried the turkey burger and it was very flavorful and cooked to perfection. The only reason I couldn't finish it was because I have a strange aversion to certain food textures and the thickness of the burger began to make me nauseous lol. But that wasn't they say's fault! They also have wonderful lunch specials! 6 wings , fries and a drink were just 7 dollars!"
4 star rating,"First off the service is very slow. The food was good and the prices are reasonable. The crowd is very loud, so much so that you could barely hear the person talking next to you. Being the only white people in the bar we were ignored by the bartender, and after the lights came on and she said last call we went to order another beer and we were told last call was 10 minutes ago! Racism happens to all ethnicities!!!!"
1 star rating,SO HERE WE GO AGAIN!...... THIS WILL BE MY THIRD TIME.....  The other two times I attended THIS establishment...my order took a hour and then it was it was all wrong... this is the third time.. They promised me my order was going to right....we shall see..... I just got my food from Kim the bartender.... my food was excellent..... thank you Kim for great service ... until next time.
5 star rating,"Ok it's pretty busy here tonight. I wasn't greeted immediately at the door upon entrance. Restaurant very crowded and noisy. I was seated close to the front where waiters and waitresses congregated . I wasn't immediately offered service after being seated. I was alone waiting on my friend. Eventually a waiter asked me was I ready to order, which I did because I had a feeling it was going to take a while for the food to arrive. They had loud music over the loud conversations. It didn't help my headache.   I have to say the waiter was very nice and attentive.  Very noisy and busy, not a place to relax."
3 star rating,"I went to They Say on a Saturday evening with my girlfriend. We only went to this bar because Atwater Brewery was so packed. As soon as we walked into the place we got ignored. We stood at the hostess table for about 5 minutes before finally being seated. After we were seated, nobody even offered us waters. People were being seated after we sat down and were waited on with drink orders right away. The place was not even that busy there were plenty of open tables around us. Finally after 15 minutes of being ignored we got up and left. We drove all the way to mid down and went to Rock City Eatery and got great service and great food. Thinking back I'm glad they were so terrible or we never would have discovered this new restaurant in mid town. I'll never go back to They Say. If I could give They Say 0 stars I would."
3.5 star rating,"Eat. The. Wings. They Say sauce us AHMAZING. I do not go downtown without stopping in. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Especially the bartenders. I have yet to have a bad experience. The recent renovations to the back are beautiful. If you don't go here, you're crazy."
5 star rating,Food is overrated they need to have more sides for your meal.  known for ribs?? They just put barbecue sauce on them after they're out of the oven not pleased at all
3 star rating,"The food was amazing. Their wings were great and desserts were omg lovely. Get their bread pudding. Even the next day reheated it's amazing. The only reason why they are getting 3/5 is because of their bar.  They have no drink menu to speak of. A rum and coke is a shot of rum two very small ice cubes and a splash of coke in a high ball glass. The bar tender didn't even know the differences between dark, amber, etc beer. We had to tell her what we wanted and she would check to see if she had it then come back... seriously?"
3 star rating,"Great food , had the wings 20 piece , half plain , half zesty barbecue . It was really good"
5 star rating,"Best catfish I ever had.  Fries were battered and seasoned, delicious!  Homemade tartar sauce and coleslaw was fabulous!"
4 star rating,"I've only had great experiences with they say. Great ambience and food! I usually get the appetizer food platter and it's enough to eat as an entree. Good service, sometimes the service have off days (when it's busy) but the delicious food and great atmosphere makes up for it"
5 star rating,Great food great service. The best cole slaw I have every had. The waitresses were wonderful and patient. If I lived in Detroit this would be my favorite place to eat. As a matter of fact I think I will drive back just to eat here. Met the managers and owner great people!!
5 star rating,Awesomeness !!!!! The waitress and hostess rocks and the food was great !!!! Def be back !!!
4 star rating,"We were visiting from Miami and stop by the Chinese Restaurant at the plaza close by... Not happy with their menu , kept searching on Yelp. They Say was very nearby and open on a Sunday 9pm. We walked in and were very welcomed by the hostess and our waitress Mecale were just sweet and helpful. Great place, great service, food was OK since I ordered pasta and were not expecting 5 star from an Italian restaurant."
4 star rating,So far this place is ok. The seafood dip is awesome and the drinks are average. I could over hear the waitresses making negative statements about a customer who just walked in. That's not cool or professional. I'm sure I'll be using my tip calculator regularly to ensure I give just the 15% gratuity.
3.5 star rating,I had never been here and was very excited to go. My sister tried to make a reservation for our party but no one answered the phone or called us back. We went anyway and when we arrived the wait staff was rude and the kitchen only wanted to prepare appetizers for us. I'm a chef and would never have treated guest this way. I will not be returning.
1 star rating,"I live across the street, and like to go here for dinner sometimes.  The food and drinks have always been amazing, I like that it's homestyle cooking.  The staff are always very friendly."
4 star rating,"They say....SAY WHAT?They say....SAY WHAT????Ugh..it was so loud in here today....I felt like I was intruding on some big party or something....Yelpers are right...the service here is not good.... Our guy...Larry maybe (couldn't hear anything) was inattentive to say the least.  It took a long time to get our burgers too...We got here around 12:45...took about 5 minutes to get ole Lar to come see us...so we ordered our drinks and burgers and we waited...and waited, and waited, and it was hard to talk because it was so loud..but finally...our burgers came...and Larry left....not before I asked him where my shoestring onions for my burger were...  He looked at me like...""Oh you wanted those""? Gurrrllll!   Uh yeah Larry...I did...  He brought them right to me..but then he was gone...gone gone gone...I had to flag another server for a drink refill....Alas Larry returned, and said, ""Y'all ready for your bill""?  Hahah..well I guess so buddy...  Sure, everything was good...thanks for asking....(p.s.  he didn't ask, I'm just making a funny here..)The burger was okay...nothing, say an Applebees or Chilis couldn't do...and there was absolutely nothing else on the menu that will have me wanting to return anytime...ever... It's basically a chain restaurant trying to be something betta...but it ain't happenin...Honestly, you can do a lot better in the area...so DO IT!"
2 star rating,"The food was ok,the service was decent, my  drink was strong and it was a down to earth environment. The steak bites are nasty,wings are pretty good and my potatoe skins were good. My boyfriend and i we're looking for a chill spot after the comedy show and stumbled into They Say. I would go back but just FYI, their menu is not extensive and it's not out of this world."
3 star rating,"My Wife and I went here a few days ago. This place was amazing. Our server was a cool guy, he was very proffesional and gave us everything we needed to have a comfortable meal. The bbq chicken sandwich I had was excellent. The chicken was tender and juicy and the bun did not overpower the sandwich. The fries were some of the best fries I have ever tasted. I thought Checkers had good fries, until now. They were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Amazing fries. My Wife got the wings with They Say sauce. The sauce was amazing and the wings were plump with tons of meat. The whole experience was just amazing. These guys deserve a visit if you never been."
5 star rating,They Say has good food. Everything on the menu is pretty decent. BUT the service is just slow. So please pack your patience if you dine in. The food and drinks are the highlight. Sit at the bar to get the fastest and most attentive service.
3 star rating,We were warned that the food would be good but the service would not be. We literally had the worst server today. It took her 20 minutes to greet our table and an additional 10 minutes to return with our drinks. We arrived at 12 noon and didn't leave until 2 thats beyond ridiculous. It wasn't even busy. The food was good but I don't think I'll return anytime soon.
1 star rating,"Very friendly staff, you have to walk past the bar to get to the host to seat you that is if you want to sit in the dinning area.   The seating area is all in front of the kitchen, and that's something I liked.  I would come back. The food you get is so good and so much!  The ""they say"" sauce is fantastic."
5 star rating,"Great for lunch and dinner. First time had the terry burger with sweet potatoe fries then went for lunch & had the wings. Burger amazing the sauce gives it good flavor, the fries too sweet for me wouldn't order them again, & the wings delicious had the house flavor on them the best!"
5 star rating,Great cozy place to have dinner then take a romantic stroll on the water. Our waitress was phenomenal. I will go back. Super nice and friendly staff.

5 star rating,"Great food and excellent service. Other reviews said the service was hit or miss. On the day we went it was a smash hit. The server was kind and attentive, even as they became really busy during prime dinner hours. The food is outstanding particularly the wings in the special spicy sauce. I had turkey chops- which I've never seen before. The server suggested it and they were incredible, as was the spinach artichoke dip appetizer and our bread pudding dessert. Even my side salad was fresh and delicious. If I lived in Detroit, this would be my favorite restaurant for sure. Love this place."
5 star rating,"I love this restaurant, I've been coming here for years! The location is wonderful especially if you like good food by the water. I've been going there for years now and it's always great food and drinks, also just an overall goodtime. I've mostly dined downstairs in the regular dining area but on two occasions I've been upstairs to the more party side. The whole staff is wonderful and attentive, one that stuck out to me is a server now bartender named Que. When I first started coming she was my waitress a few times, always checked on me and my table, kept our drinks filled and provided us with a few laughs. Now she's a bartender there and makes really good drinks. I'm not a huge drinker so I normally stick to the same drink but I always ask for a suggestion on new drinks and I'm always satisfied. One of my favorite restaurants in the area! You have to order their wings!:)"

2 star rating,"Went here before a show at Chene Park because Andrews was closed (wha?).  Pleasantly surprised.  Food was good and inexpensive, drinks were cold (frosted beer mugs ftw), and service was friendly.  The woman tending bar worked her @$$ off.  Positive experience."
4 star rating,"The food is excellent but the service is hit or miss. I love the lamb chops, the wings are covered in a delicious bbq sauce, the salads are fresh, etc. The location is great. I really like the lofty look of this restaurant.  Dark with exposed brick but very modern. The bathrooms are clean and they don't have any of those annoying bathroom attendants. Downstairs is the main bar and restaurant. Upstairs is huge with a bar, lounge area, more tables, dance floor, as well as outdoor patio/terrace. They charge a cover to go upstairs. It is not worth it unless you are there to attend a private function or birthday party. Most of the guest seem to be in their middle 30s and older. The servers disappear and have to be flagged down. The bartenders are hit or miss as well. I've been at times where it's really busy and can totally understand. But I've also been when that was not the case and still had to flag someone down to be acknowledged."

1 star rating,"Terrible! Terrible!! Terrible!!! Our waitress was provided the worst service ever.  If Katrinna is your waitress be prepared to wait five minutes and 40 minutes or more for your food.  She stood over of me while I signed the receipt...Needless to say she got no tip.  I tipped the nice guy waiter since he was more interested in providing service to our table.OH the food.  They Say wings were just okay, mediocre.  Fried shrimps a bit doughy but had good flavor.  Flood's has better fried shrimp.  Lamb chops were dry and fried entirely to hard.  I'll never come back to this restaurant again."
3.5 star rating,Anytime I'm in Detroit I have to stop by and get my they say wings!!! Super friendly people... Speedy service and delicious food... What more can you ask for
5 star rating,Location and decor is pretty good. The food options are limited. I had the turkey sandwich and it was okay. Price to is to steep for the quality and options you have. Happy hour is nonexistent or it's like I believe $2 off already over average prices drinks for it to be a bar downtown off the water. My return is simply based off limited food options at home and they are located across the street from me
2 star rating,"We went there today with a friend who recommended it for lunch.  The food was absolutely excellent and the staff was friendly and attentive.  They didn't have the red velvet cheesecake that was on the menu, but did have a red velvet cake.  When they brought it out it was so large (5 layers!) that it fed all three of us--for $5.95.  Highly recommend this place--atmosphere was upbeat, hip and modern and bathrooms were VERY clean."
5 star rating,"I chose to take my son to They Say for lumch today because he'd never been there before. We got there at 4 PM and the waitress came to our table 5 mimutes later to get our drink order. Appx 5 minutes later she returned with our beverages, left our table and never returned. After waiting for 20 minutes for our order to be taken we left and went to Sweetwater Tavern where we got our meal within 15 minutes. The most irritatimg part is that it wasn't even crowded!!!"
1 star rating,"I wish I'd go to They Say more often. I mean, it always seems to be packed -- when I ride by, there are cars lining the streets and I always see people streaming in and out of there. Well, I went one day for an event held in the upstairs lounge area. But first, I sat downstairs at the bar. The bartender was nice and suggested a couple of their house specialty drinks: They Say and the Riverwalk. They were both good -- contained several different Cirocs, along with juices, etc. Catch them on a happy hour, though. Otherwise, it's going to be a bit pricy. Others at the bar ordered appetizers -- the wings looked scrumptious, the potato skins did too. They looked so good, I ordered some. They were great. My friend ordered the buffalo shrimp, which was a plentiful order, but the shrimp reminded me of the kind you can buy from the frozen food section of your local grocer and just drench in hot sauce yourself.I'd love to go back, though. The vibe in there is really chill. It's the spot where you want to just hang at the bar or go with friends and dine."
4 star rating,"Food and drinks ok, but nothing extra special. It's best to get there early, around  6 or 7 to get seats and not have to wait. The music can get pretty loud making it difficult to hear others talking at times. Overall, it's a nice hangout spot."
3 star rating,They had some really good wings. With good parking. Their customer service is really good. I would go back. I got the hot wings and they were better than bww.
5 star rating,"This was a nice place, good food especially the steak bites.  Good service and great for ballrooming."
4 star rating,"I am actually pretty surprised by all the good reviews of this place, considering my recent experience there. That is until I got to the bottom of the review list and saw that someone else had almost the same bad experience that my group did. It would seem that They Say is the place to be if you have a party of four or fewer. Anything larger than that and the service completely breaks down. My walking group (of eight)  and I decided to stop in in the midst of our enjoyment of the river walk. We were not greeted upon entering and were looked at in confusion by the staff, as if they didn't understand what customers were. We were finally seated and then waited about five minutes for our server, despite the restaurant being all but empty. When she did arrive at our table she brought water for us all, which would explain the delay, but then informed us that we had missed happy hour by one minute. Suffice it to say, our table was not happy with this pronouncement. Thinks seemed to go down hill from there. The server immediately asked for our order, despite not having given us much time to review the menu. I placed my order, before realizing the others weren't ready and then asked her to just give us a few minutes to review the menu. I was surprised when a relatively short time later my order was delivered, despite the fact that nobody else had even placed their food order yet. I had the uncomfortable experience of bring forced to eat alone while everyone else looked on hungrily. One of our group placed her order only to be informed that the kitchen was out of that dish. A surprising turn of events considering there was really nobody in the restaurant to have eaten through that dish. For the most part the food was good and was reasonably priced. The biggest issue came when the bill arrived. The server had apparently explained to one of our party that the bill could not be split up. (Disclaimer: I worked in the service  industry for about a decade and think it is complete and utter bullsh*t when a server says that they can not split the bill. It is not a difficult thing to do when you have a computer system, which they did, and is an easy way to accommodate your customers. Any server with half a brain should be able to accommodate this request...but, I digress). The server stated that each patron who wished to pay with a credit card would have to calculate their own total and tell her what amount they wanted to include on their card. She did not explain that the gratuity had been added and that they could not just add it to their credit card as one normally would. Without getting into anymore of the annoying details I will say that it took an hour from the time all eight of us had finished eating to pay the bill and leave the restaurant. We were all extremely unhappy with the whole experience and each and every one of us vows never to set foot in this restaurant again. I was nominated to write the Yelp review on behalf of our group because I am a Yelper anyway. I hope that you take this review to heart if considering patronizing this place with a large group. If they can't handle a group of our size when the restaurant is completely dead, I can not imagine the type of service one would receive on a busy night."
1 star rating,Food is mediocre. The best thing on the menu is the chicken wings. Waiters and bartenders r very rude. Customer service is terrible. I sat at the bar and the bartender took 30 mins to acknowledge us. They were rude as I was ordering my food as well. I don't plan on goin back.
3.5 star rating,"OMG! THEY SAY the wings are THE BOMB! ... THEY weren't lying!I must say, They-Say was a GREAT place to eat, an amazing place to chill and enjoy live entertainment and an all around great time! My wife and I decided to go with a few of our friends and see what They-Say had to offer. The place was easy to find, well kept and had a great decor! The menu was simple, but featured some GREAT choices for appetizers, entrées, drinks and desserts.From previous reviews I figured my best bet was to try the BBQ wings. And boy were they RIGHT! The wings were AMAZING! They were on the They-Say Trio appetizer, which also came with some of the BEST quesadillas and potato skins I've had in a long time! I just had to follow up those delicious wings with the BBQ Half-Chicken dinner with Mashed Potatoes and veggies! Mind you, I asked for cheese on my Mashed Potatoes and they actually gave me a GOOD AMOUNT of cheese! Most places skimp on it, or don't allow you to have it, but they didn't hold back! And the chicken was SPECTACULAR glazed in the They-Say Barbecue Sauce. We finished the meal off with some great Martini's, wine and a bread pudding that was to die for!We  spent the remainder of our evening there enjoying the sounds of the live band and singer. They played some great smooth jazz and R&B songs, and really made the night special! I will definitely visit the restaurant again and next time I may even try the lounge!"

5 star rating,"I visted They Say at 5pm on a Tuesday evening and it was maybe four or five other couples. I with with a girlfriend and she ordered the turkey burger with sweet potato fries. I had a chance to taste both and they both were okay. The turkey burger was under seasoned and the sweet potato fries were too. The wings that I ordered (tangy something & BBQ) were great. Pretty big too. I ordered a side of french fries which were good. My friend said they were seasoned with Old Bay. They Say is a really laid back restaurant. A nice place to go on a date as it has a laid back, kind of romantic vibe. They had some other great things on the menu i would like to try. Pretty simple, but classics. I will be returning to experience some more of They Say."
4 star rating,Service is awesome!!! Had 3 different type of wings zesty....hot.....BBQ awesome as well. One of my daughters favorite place. Children always welcome and noise is at a minimum.
5 star rating,"Amazing bbq and a great place to watch a game. Want great ribs, but don't feel like waiting an hour or two with l he other suburbanites? This is your place. Real detroit bbq done right. Make sure to get some wings with the ""they say"" sauce - so amazing."
5 star rating,"I've only been there during lunch. The lunch specials are good and only $7. The burger and their ""they say"" wings with the ""they say"" sauce (aka bbq sauce) are good, so ""they say"" lol. Service was good. Only issue is that you leave there smelling like you worked in their kitchen. Prob bad ventilation system? They need to get that checked out or give us hazmat suits. Smelling like food for the rest of the day at work was a buzz kill."
3 star rating,Live right across the street and love coming in for a drink. The wings are the best I've had in the city. Great place!
4 star rating,"This was not a good place for me at all. The waitress that I had was very rude and she took a very long time to assist me, every time she came back to the table. Also it took forever for me to get my food and all I had was french fries and a side of BBQ sauce. I went on a Saturday around 6pm, it was not crowded at all. The BBQ sauce for the wings is excellent. The menu has a little bit of everything. It doesn't stick to one type of food. The art work on the wall was beautiful. The bathrooms were nice and neat. They have an upstairs but it wasn't opened. They have take out and you can call in your order. I will go back again to see if I have a different experience."
3 star rating,I really like the They Say wings. I go here at least twice a month for them. The other food that I've had there is OK. I do like the atmosphere there and it is a cool place to grab a drink in the evening.
3 star rating,"The food here is really good, that was a pleasant surprise. I had the baked potato, & the chicken tender salad. The chicken tenders were fresh, juicy, & well seasoned. The club upstairs wasn't my thing, but i enjoyed the downstairs atmosphere."
3.5 star rating,"Great food, great environment! Drinks are extremely reasonable with a very friendly and professional staff. Definitely a must visit."
5 star rating,"Love this place. I order ribs and let me say, they give you a whole rack for a good price. This place is hidden and parking is a little bit off to the side, but overall the place is nice and clean inside and the food is delicious. I give it a 4 because of the limited parking. Other than that, it's a great jazzy place to hang out."
4 star rating,"The brisket sandwich was excellent, the service was super friendly, and the prices are fair."
4 star rating,Being honest the food is on point but when they're busy it's like they don't know what to do and I only go there for food anyway and if the kitchen is backed up they just shut the kitchen down until they can get caught up which could take an hour or so. This isn't the first time they have told me this by my thing is if u are constantly doing this maybe I should expand your kitchen. Other than that the place is cool just a bit small
1 star rating,First time at They Say!!! The wings were delicious as we'll as the carrot cake. I will definitely come back again
4 star rating,"Isn't it great to stumble upon the perfect bar when you're visiting an unfamiliar city? They Say was exactly the right place at the right time. Located near the Roberts Riverwalk, my husband and I were pleased to find this trendy, comfortable, affable bar close to our hotel. We enjoyed a few cocktails and dessert at a decent price. We admired the food as it came out of the kitchen and was delivered to other tables. This will be a dinner destination next time we're in town for sure. Oh yeah, it doesn't hurt that everyone in the place was well dressed and attractive. You won't be disappointed."
4 star rating,"Went here before a show at Chene Park because Andrews was closed (wha?).  Pleasantly surprised.  Food was good and inexpensive, drinks were cold (frosted beer mugs ftw), and service was friendly.  The woman tending bar worked her @$$ off.  Positive experience."
4 star rating,"Met with a former coworker for dinner and drinks and enjoyed the atmosphere while watching the food go out to other tables. Our waitress was kind and polite and the food was delicious.   They SAY was a perfect place for cocktails, conversation, and catching up with a friend. We will definitely visit again."
4 star rating,"I love this place, drinks are always on point, the turkey chops Omg! Are to die for if you never had them try them out I promise you, you will not be disappointed"
5 star rating,"I visited the upstairs lounge for a birthday, and I was a bit surprised by the $5 cover. At any rate, it was rather cramped, and there wasn't much table seating available. The dance floor was rather small, as well. Though the bartenders do manage to provide service as promptly as possible, when I visited, the bartenders did not have enough glasses to go around. It was so bad that I couldn't even order a glass of water because there were none available. The drinks were also a little pricey, as well. Other than that, the DJ played good music and kept a lively atmosphere. Also, they had some of the best wings I've had in a long time, and they were relatively inexpensive."
3.5 star rating,"They Say had a very nice atmosphere, everyone was very friendly and the service was excellent. We sat at the bar, drink specials are amazing! We started with the spinach and artichoke dip which was great, I think they make it in house. For my meal I got the wings with the zesty sauce...DELICIOUS! They were so good...would not recommend if you're on a date though as they are very saucy. My boyfriend had the cajun chicken alfredo which I got to steal a bite of and that too was super tasty! All in all we had a great meal that didn't burn a hole in our wallets and will be coming back regularly :)"
5 star rating,"I have frequented They Say on many occasions. Stopped by there after an event on Saturday night, and ordered the Lamb Chop...ummm ummmh hmmmmm!!! The best!!! Chef sure does put his foot it that one!!! Also check out that drink called ""Exotic Waters"" I absolutely love it! The ambiance is nice, and the wait staff is cool. I will be returning again."
5 star rating,"The ""They Say' wings are awesome. They're the only thing I've had and I've been numerous times"
4 star rating,"The food is excellent but the service is hit or miss. I love the lamb chops, the wings are covered in a delicious bbq sauce, the salads are fresh, etc. The location is great. I really like the lofty look of this restaurant.  Dark with exposed brick but very modern. The bathrooms are clean and they don't have any of those annoying bathroom attendants. Downstairs is the main bar and restaurant. Upstairs is huge with a bar, lounge area, more tables, dance floor, as well as outdoor patio/terrace. They charge a cover to go upstairs. It is not worth it unless you are there to attend a private function or birthday party. Most of the guest seem to be in their middle 30s and older. The servers disappear and have to be flagged down. The bartenders are hit or miss as well. I've been at times where it's really busy and can totally understand. But I've also been when that was not the case and still had to flag someone down to be acknowledged."
3 star rating,"They Say is a cool jazz spot downtown that is very intimate and perfect for a date. There are two floors, although the top floor is small. All weekend you can listen to some music, while also indulging in their wings (to die for) and barbecue. They also have numerous other appetizers to dine on if you decided to come through for a happy hour or such. The prices are family reasonable. You can get 18 wings for roughly $12.  They also occasionally have specials on their martinis."
4 star rating,"I had the opportunity to kick it at ""They Say"" last night. The entire visit was totally impromptu. My BFF and I stopped in after a stroll down the river walk. It wasn't my normal cup of tea because I like to dress when I go out. T-shirts and jeans has never really seemed appropriate for when going out for an evening. My BFF was right when she said my attire was OK and boy was she right. Just about every one had on t-shirts and jeans. The DJ was OK and so the drinks were made well. We spent the majority of the evening on the outside deck which was cool. The vibe of this spot is nice. Everyone seemed to be drinking and enjoying the presence of good friends."
3 star rating,"we had never heard of this place but happened to be walking by and caught the fantastic aroma of ""they say"" sauce.  a half slab of baby backs and a rib tip dinner later we emerged happy people .  btw the cole slaw was possibly the best cole slaw ever."
5 star rating,I so love this place!!! Its so cozy and laid back. Good place to host a party. The food is great!!
5 star rating,"I reserved this restaurant for my graduation dinner in May 2013 two weeks prior to the date for 15 people, after being pleased with my previous experiences here. My party got to the restaurant at 3:50, 10 minutes before my reservation at 4:00. Nothing was set up and the staff acted as though they were surprised that we were there, even though they had it marked on their calendar that I had a reservation for that day. After finally being seated and orders being taken, our food came out an hour and 15 minutes later. I understood that with a big part; however, there were maybe 4 other people in the restaurant. Also, I was not advised that everyone would have to be on one bill when making the reservation. Therefore, there were people who only had their credit cards and the servers and manager stated they could not split the bill and advised us to calculate our totals individually, including splitting the tip and gratuity. After 45 minutes of debate, they finally just split the bill. I was very displeased with their professionalism and customer service."
