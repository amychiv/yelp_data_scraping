3.5 star rating,Seafood gumbo is fire!!!!!! Fast service! The food is fresh and hot as well! Highly recommend!
5 star rating,"I tried going to the location on 8 mile twice. The first time the line was so long and unmoving that I left after about 20 minutes. What I saw made me not want to try them without watching them make my food. Someone ordered turkey wings. I watched with my own eyes that the person making the plates gave them 2 turkey bones and then fished in the juice for a few peices of meat. Then they wrapped it up in aluminum foil. Whomever's food that was was going to be HIGHLY upset. They know they are so wrong for that. They aren't cheap at all. BUYER BEWARE!!! If you go here, check your food before you leave, preferably while they are making it. The second time I tried going (knowing I was going to watch them make my food) i waited in line about 30 minutes with the line barely moving. I gave up and doubt I'll be back."
1 star rating,Great time at LeCultute Cafe with my husband and sisters. We were quickly served and food came out fresh. We ordered drinks from the bar and they made our martinis to order
4 star rating,I've been twice to order takeout and both times were Absolutely AMAZING!!! I ordered the salmon tower both times (once fried and once grilled) LOVED them both! They have amazing greens and macaroni and cheese. On Saturday we ordered the Greens & Seafood Eggrolls for the first time and they were great!!!! We also ordered dessert for the first time and our Strawberry Banana Pudding was OUTSTANDING!!!! The best I've ever had- worth every penny!!! I am from Néw Orleans and this place rivals even the best New Orleans has to offer! We drive all the way from Lake Orion Michigan just to experience Le Culture Cafe's great cuisine!
5 star rating,"My experience here was a WORLD of a difference from my 1st dining experience at the previous location. For my most recent experience: I highly advised you to book a reservation online. They text you to confirm the day before.When I entered I was greeted right away! My wait time for a table wasn't long. The waitress acknowledged us when were seated and seemed happy to be there to serve us. My food came out in reasonable time and the portion was just right. I cleaned the plate and didn't feel hungry or overly full. My guest was happy with their experience as well.Whoever trained the staff did a excellent job. The manager handled a situation with a group who had an issue with seating arrangements for a large party very well.When I asked for water I got it right away, when I asked where the restroom was, she walked me to it, when I complained of no paper towel in the bathroom, they immediately got some. Customer service is definitely a priority. I never felt like I was waiting around for an excessive amount of time for something.My food was simply excellent from the presentation to the way it tasted. I loved it!The new location is much bigger than the last. The decor, the staff, the food was all so nice! The music was nice, the live music was even better. I had a superior experience and I can't wait to come back!You should book a reservation right now."
5 star rating,"I can't believe I just paid $50+ for a carry out. I ordered Lamb chops from this establishment. The young lady Sacha ask me how would I like them cooked, I expressed that I would like them cooked medium rare only to get home to some over cooked Lamb Chops how gross . I'm done  this is the second time I've tried this establishment and received terrible food and service. The 8 mile location!!!!!"
1 star rating,"Wack AF!!!! I ordered Crab grill cheese which was cold AF, cheese wasn't melted and I waited a extra 30 min after I arrived to pick up my carry out!!! Fries was cold AF too!!! I WILL NEVER EVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE  You try and Patronize small black business that turned around screw you in the end!! Never ever again. This is the second time I've had horrible service at this dump"
1 star rating,The food was really good. For apps we had the chicken bacon and egg rolls and the crab cake. The crab was good and it wasn't a lot of filler. For entrees we both had the salmon tower. Only thing i didn't like that it was a lot of mashed potatoes. Our food came out super fast we were there like 30mins.  I'd wld have liked for my app to come before my meal.
5 star rating,I sat at the bar when i got here. They weren't really hustle and bustle busy but there were enough ppl. I had a jack and coke and ordered the Seafood omelette. The food took about 30mins to come out. The food is amazing. The wait for it on the other hand not so much. If they could speed it up in the kitchen they would be 5 star. Also i noticed the bartender doesn't have anywhere to put dirty dishes
4 star rating,"Being that they are an up and coming restaurant, I struggled with giving an unfavorable review but constructive criticism is always helpful. We made reservations over a month in advance for date night - Saturday at 6 pm. Arriving on time, we were pointed towards the back of the restaurant where there was a small waiting area. The area was packed, so stood about 15 minutes waiting for our table. No harm. No foul.I was a bit surprised by the loud noise level. The noise level veers towards the ""cafe"" side. We were sat between two other couples."
3 star rating,Seriously overpriced!! They charged a 20% service charge and they asked for gratuity on top of that
1 star rating,"This place just opened a carry out on 8 mile last week. I think they were not prepared for the customer base. The pick up was all over the place, they didn't answer the phone when you attemptedtocall to place an order, you had to place your order in person/ no online either, unorganized set up, people everywhere frustrated and they played rap with curse words as you waited and the wait was very long (an hour and half). I specifically requested NO ONIONS (due to an allergy) on made to order $46  Salmon Tower and I received with scallions garnished (I had to pick them off).The food was actually good but extremely rich. Unfortunately that richness caused restroom problems. Our bill was $132 (2 entrees/1 appetizer/2 lemonades)...so the problems we incurred were frustrating taking into consideration the money we spent. I hope they work out the kinks it's black-owned and I would like to support again in the future (but not now).  One of the only reasons I gave 3 stars instead of 2 was because the Strawberry Lemonade is one of the best I have tasted in a long time (homemade)."
3.5 star rating,"I have been waiting a long time to go, here. They are kind of pricey, but you get what you pay for and that's a GREAT, thing! We all enjoyed our meals and appetizers. All everybody at the table could talk about is how they are coming back. It was a live band and we really enjoyed ourselves! This is my new FAVE spot."
5 star rating,"Listen, due to covid I wasn't able to sit in and enjoy my meal but LAWD...I finally found a restaurant that's truly good and WORTH the price I paid. I got the Salmon tower with candied yams. Almost $50 but I definitely would have happily paid more especially if dine in were available and I could have ordered a drink or two. It's so delicious. I arrived when I learned that there was no dine-in, & ordered my meal. They gave me an estimated 45 minute wait time but I waited in my car right in front for about 20 minutes when they gave me a call. If anyone has any other recommendations for amazing food like this place please message me. I'm new here and I live near the airport but I will make a drive for really good food"
5 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place forever, and I finally got the chance to go for a Saturday morning brunch last weekend. I made reservations, so we were seated right away. My son and I were a little over dressed, though. I was in a dress, and he was in dress slacks and shirt, but everyone else was in jeans or other casual clothes. Maybe people dress up more in the evening? Anyway, brunch here is casual in case you're wondering what to wear. Service was great, although they do warn you that there will be a wait as everything is made from scratch. No problem. It was worth the wait (and it really wasn't that long, anyway).Their brunch menu is large and unique. I had a hard time deciding what to get from so many tempting options, but I went with the shrimp and grits. Omg. Heaven on a plate. The grits are made with gouda cheese and are the best grits I've ever had. My son enjoyed his chicken and bacon rollup sandwich and fries. Parking here might be tricky on a busy night, but early on a Saturday morning I was able to park right in front of the restaurant. Highly recommend for a memorable meal."

1 star rating,"When you walk into the space, you feel a good vibe. There's bumpin' music, young patrons, vibrant servers, all of this makes for a positive experience, especially on a girls night out. What I will say about the food is that it is indulgent. The featured ""grain"" that is served at the table is a croissant drenched in a sugary honey concoction. My girls loved them and ordered extra (for an extra charge of course). I thought it was too sweet to start out my meal and if you didn't eat it when it was warm, no bueno.For appetizers, we ordered crab cakes, culture wings and steak bites. The crab cakes (see pic) were not great - a bit rubbery and too much filler/breading. The steak bites were tasty-well seasoned and cooked properly. The wings (see pic) are served in the ""Hastings"" sauce (menu items feature several tributes/references to the Black Bottom neighborhood) and set aflame on the table. A lot of show and no go. Wings were tasty enough, but for $12, I'll pass. I'm a VERY discerning wing connoisseur. I liked the fact that they're small and naked. The sauce was nothing to ride down Hastings for. One of my girls and I ordered the lamb chops with a side of brussel sprouts (see pic). Both orders were cooked under. I ordered medium and she ordered well. I got medium rare and she got medium. Still, they were seasoned nicely, simmered in a wonderful sauce. I couldn't eat them all anyway and they were perfect heated up in the microwave the next day. The brussel sprouts were not that impressive. Would rather have a serving of tender green beans sautéed in garlic n olive oil or something.  Ready for the brussel sprout trend to end.I tried another friend's chicken mamba pasta. That was good. I would order it the next time. I also tried the Mac n cheese with fried lobster. A lil indulgent for my taste as a meal, but was delicious to try. My girlfriend enjoyed it. The cocktails - they featured a watermelon vodka cooler. It was yummy, but overpriced at $12. Then when I saw the plastic cooler of pre-made watermelon juice/Koolaid at the bar, it cheapened it. Also, I can't believe they feature so many top dollar ($40+) protein options and don't have a decent wine list! This kills me. At least offer a nice Cabernet if you're going to get me for $40 for lamb chops. It's like wearing a Valentino dress with some shoes from Aldo. I mean, you can do it, but,....The service was good. Food was a bit slow coming out of the kitchen, but we were full on apps and chatting quite a bit. Our server was nice and high energy. But then again, they do tack a 20% service charge onto the bill. This was no problem because we all planned to tip. Just maybe a delicate notification of that by the server before ordering might have been more diplomatic? Some members of my party didn't like it at all. Overall, this spot is solid. I will return. It's a fun space. Plan to spend $100 easily for dinner. Not sure if the price points are on point. They need to tighten up to justify those prices if they want to be around in the long run. I'll support though and hope to see growth."
3 star rating,"The ambiance was great. Drinks were good. Food...meh. Nothing special. I was disappointed. We ordered both appetizers; the wings were good although not hot in temp just barely warm. The crab cakes were bland and cool. We were out with another couple so we ordered 4 different dishes; a burger which was bland, really no seasoning at all and last to come out after the other dishes had already come out. The salmon tower-Salmon was burnt on one side. They had that side down and I ate from the top so I didn't notice till half way through. Also lacked seasoning. The macaroni with lobster was very rich, to much for a main dish. The pasta with chicken and shrimp was delicious. The croissants were okay, nothing special just heated up and drizzled with a honey butter of some sorts. Their only dessert was cheesecake which appeared and tasted store bought, sliced and served. Very dissatisfied. The food also took a long time to come out and they were not packed. So we gave them another try. My burger was cooked to perfection and seasoned well. My son liked his wings although my husband felt they were over cooked. My mom liked her shrimp. My husband did not like his sandwich. The chicken was over fried. He literally put it in the trash. The best chicken sandwich we have had is at The Gripper. These pale in comparison. Just not worth the $100 tab. I'm saddened all of us did not like our food. Just nothing special for me."

2 star rating,They had the nerve to sell this and call it peach cobbler . A burnt mess. Do not order the peach cobbler.
1 star rating,There was a bit of a wait but the food was delicious! I truly enjoyed myself.. as well as the drinks! Will definitely come again! Staff was really nice. Especially Our waitress Billy! Great food. Great atmosphere.and live music.
5 star rating,"The food was soooo good from the honey buttered croissants to the corn beef egg rolls and steak bites for the appetizers to the entrees ( pics) to end with the peach cobbler(not pictured it went fast!) Our waitress was awesome and attentive. She gave great suggestions and the live band had me grooving in my seat! Great night out with friends that due to covid we had not seen in over a year. Thanks for great service, great food, great ambiance and a great experience overall!"
5 star rating,"I've been following the owner on Instagram for a while and his food always looked amazing so I had to stop in.Reservations: I made reservations a month in advance and was easily accommodated. They was no wait for my sisters and I.Atmosphere: I expected more grand entry. It was chill and laid back. Drinks: Patron margarita was tasty.Food: appetizer: chicken was really good but only came with flat pieces. The bread was buttery with syrup. The lamb chops were overall price. I would've liked if it came 4 for 32 instead of 3. The fries were decent. Salmon burger was salty. I ordered the salmon tower. It came with spinach, mashed potatoes and one side. I ordered the Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese was good. The salmon had a lot of food. The parking was difficult. There's many ways to get a ticket on that street so I parked in the rear. It's overhyped. Overly expensive because the atmosphere doesn't match the price. The service is attentive just wish there was a bigger menu."
3.5 star rating,"ListenI've heard mixed reviews Abbott this place and I personally steered clear of it because of what I've heard ... "" too expensive, food just okay "" .Well for my birthday I was invited to brunch and I steadfastly accepted the invite . Well the pLace was smaller than I expected but still great . The staff was pleasant and knowledgeable. We were walk ins and afteer 20 minutes were seated ( party of 3) after studying the menu like I was prepwRing for  my final exam  decided on the seafood overload omelet $21.00 ...Well it aaroved and was massive and came with 2 sides , I order the pancake and hash brown alSo the mimosas . My food arrived looking like something out of a cooking show ... beautiful and big enough for two . The food was amazing and I will be back ."
4 star rating,"I was finally able to reserve and dine in at LeCulture Cafe, after much anticipation, and following the IG page for a couple of months before the grand opening in November/2018.My friend and I had reservations for 4:30 pm, last Thursday, and I wanted the earlier time, just Bc I had read mixed reviews about the long wait, and lack luster service, due to how crowded the restaurant was.  I will say, I believe the earlier time made all of the difference for my experience!I was pleasantly pleased with the service, our waitress was great, and our food came out in a timely manner!  The food was really good!  I ordered the Seafood Overload Macaroni and Cheese, and for appetizers I ordered the Wings (all flats, I loved it).  My friend and I split the cheesecake, and that was really good as well.  Oh, I we also had the Croissants, and those were delicious!  Overall great experience, and I plan on making reservations to return soon!  The portions were huge, I had food left over for the next day!"
5 star rating,"My wife & I enjoyed dinner as first time visitors celebrating our 3rd wedding anniversary last night.Let's get the negatives out of the way;-Parking sucks....we got a tix because we didn't park two blocks from the restaurant up Gratiot Av. Play close attention to the parking signs.-Dining space is cramped. I felt like everyone else was listening to our conversation aside from constantly giving pardon to the staff as they serviced their tables.-The restrooms are disappointing, even for a guy - no secure locks (almost walked in on ladies using both unisex facilities) plus the hot water didn't work in faucets, which immediately causes me to question if staff washes their hands regularly!*That being said* The wait staff is very nice and attentive. Our selections were very tasty, flavorful and are indeed large portions. I ordered the Salmon Tower and I was pleasantly surprised to get a (larger than normal) piece of Salmon, which was sitting on top of homemade mashed potatoes. The sautéed spinach, shrimp and crap lump added depth to the dish. Because of the previously posted pics, I asked for light sauce and it payed off as it was just enough to enjoy every component on the plate without overpowering it. I tried for the very first time Brussel sprouts w bacon. They were cooked in an Asian/Teriyaki-style sauce...my wife said they were very good. She ordered the Dirty Bird Chicken w Mac & Cheese and she gave it a thumbs up. Cooking & serving the mac in the cast iron skillet was brilliant because it was still hot, even at the end of our dinner.Overall, we enjoyed it and will go back again. Now, if the staff and food remain consistent, they'll need to expand or relocate soon."
4 star rating,"3 stars because my sister & I LOVE BRUNCH HERE!!! Dinner on the other hand... my husband & I have given this place two chances. Not worth it in my opinion. Today we went and in total we spent 3 hours there. Waited an hour for seating, an hour for our appetizers, drinks, and bread... another hour for our food and incorrect bill. We spent 250$ and the food was not completely worth it. The lobster corn dogs, my husband loved them! The culture wings, they tasted better when we had them on Valentine's Day The ""Lobster"" spinach dip, was missing the spinach and lobster. Although it was lacking both it tasted pretty goodThe rolls are amazing!!! The lamb chops.... we've had better, but they were okay.The mamba pasta with shrimp and chicken was okay! The Mac & Cheese was the only food besides the bread that was actually hot! Everything else was warm, which was very disappointing. My sister and I will probably be back for brunch, but we've given up on the dinner."
3 star rating,"I keep giving this place a try. I promise no more chances. I placed a carry out. The young lady was dry and unfriendly. I asked her if any sides come with the entrees, she responded short and didn't answer my question. She told me our food would be an hour to come up. Excessive, but I said ok. I know a lot of places are short staffed. But now it's been close to 2 hrs. For a meal over $260 it has to be better customer service. The food is good- for the most part- but the prices are high end but the customer service is fast food. I try to support black owned but yeah- I'll go where my money gives me the customer service I am accustomed to. I'm done."
2 star rating,"I wanted so bad for the bad reviews to not be accurate and for my experience to be different. I talked my husband into coming. He was hesitant because he called twice and the restaurant didn't pick up the phone. He said it was a bad sign for customer service. He was right. We arrived at 4:53. Wasn't too crowded so I was hopeful.  The staff greeted me and let me know it would be about a 30 minute wait because they had 5pm reservations to seat. No problem. The seating area was in the back of the restaurant so we waited patiently. 30 minutes came and went so I went back to the front to ask about our wait. She said it ""could"" be another 30 minutes or more because they still had to service people with reservations. This was frustrating. First, you are pushing no need for reservations but it is obvious their run of house is not organized. Second, was anyone going to provide customer service and tell us our wait time has been extended another 30 minutes or more? We were finally called ( we were actually about to walk out the door) and placed at a table literally right next to the door. On a cold rainy day- no thank you. We asked to be moved and they placed us at a table right next to it that was so small I can't see how anyone could eat there. Good luck in the dead of winter with tables right next to the door. This is the issue- they have a good product. The food that I saw looked great. Smelled great. But if they don't get their customer service down, unfortunately they won't make it. People will try it once but it won't sustain because people won't return. We ended up leaving. My husband was over it. I really want this place to succeed. We eat out a lot. Customer service is KEY to us. We won't patronize a place we feel is lacking. Please- get an experienced manager and hostess staff to run the front of house. Invest in experienced staff that excel at customer service. Change the front seating. It's awkward and lots of space is wasted with the two  large tabletop seats that nobody is at. Get experienced quality staff and more of them. Provide them with continued professional development. Get your walk in and reservations down. If you want to compete with all of these new places downtown and brand yourself as upscale dining, the food is only half the battle. Experience is everything. I gave two stars because there is still lots of potential. If you go- make a reservation. These folks did get seated in a decent time."
2 star rating,"Visited with a group of friends for a birthday. We expected the food to be good, and it was amazing!  Better yet though, the service was second to none!  Our waitress Tonya, and our bartender Rae were both amazing!!!  They went far above and beyond what I expected.  This place is DEFINITELY a gem of Detroit! TIP: Park in the back of the building - it's free!  You WILL get a ticket if you park in front."
5 star rating,I ordered the Lobster and Crab Cakes with Brussels sprouts and duck bacon as my side.The lobster and crab cakes were so delicious as well the Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts had a nice flavor to it because of the sauce that was on it. I would say that I thought the lobster and crab cakes entree was me getting a lobster and then my crab cakes as well but their is lobster in the crab cakes and not two separate things if that makes sense just an FYI when ordering. It was still delicious and I walked out satisfied.
4 star rating,"After hearing mixed reviews about this place it was my turn to have the LeCulture experience. I dined in on a weekday(Wednesday evening). When I arrived I was promptly greeted and asked if I had a reservation, we did.  The decor reminds me of an old bar turned into a restaurant, it works though.We were seated at a half booth/table. Water was placed before me without a lemon which I appreciate greatly! *I hate lemon in water when it's not requested. Jamin was our waiter, he was extremely pleasant and greeted us each time with a smile and was very attentive. We ordered the LeCulture wings as an appetizer. Not long after a plate of all flats was presented. The wings looked as if they came from a regular chicken and not one that was in a body building competition. A+. The wings were presented on a plate with flambé'. Neat. What I appreciated was that Jamin asked about a peanut allergy which is noted on the menu but I was pleased that he asked. The honey butter croissants weren't anything to get excited about. I felt like I was eating a croissant bought in bulk from Sams Club, that was heated up with honey butter. I ordered the Bone in Ribeye (which only comes in one size),a side of Mac & cheese and the Broccolini. The steak was a nice size in regards to thickness, I ordered it prepared med-well and it was cooked perfectly. The taste is reminiscent of the J. Alexander's Steak Maui. The accompanying mashed potatoes were a tad dense but seasoned just right. No complaints about my main course. The side of Mac and Cheese is really for two people. It was brought in small cast iron skillet. Creamy and lots of cheese but not the taste I expected. It was nothing to excite me. The broccolini was topped with parm and was tough to cut, it could've been steamed a little long but the color was poppin and the taste was good.The food portions were so large that I asked for a carry out container right away to put most of the food away for a treat the day after. I ordered The Gratiot which comes in at $25! It was NICE! Finally, I decided on the Black Bottom cheesecake. I think it may have been my least favorite of all the food I tried. Loved the presentation but nothing really tickled my tastebuds. Unisex restrooms, clean and good mirrors. It's wheelchair accessible but small on the inside. Good lighting. GREAT playlist! I mean myself and another patron jammed the whole time! All in all LeCulture proved to be a nice experience. Based on other things I've heard I probably would never go on a weekend.  The service was great, most of food was good, I would like to go back and try a few other dishes. I most definitely would get The Gratiot again lol."
4 star rating,"This was my first time coming here. The food is definitely on point! Before I go into that, though, there's an entrance in the back way that you can go in. Unfortunately, there is no sign specifying that you can enter, so my significant other approached a man who happens to work at Le Coultre and said we can go in that door. Sure enough, we walked in to a mellow, yet sophisticated atmosphere. There was a picture of the late great Billy Holiday among other greats. We went to the front of the restaurant and I gave my name and was seated in less than two minutes. In less than 10 minutes, our waitress approached us. She, along with other staff members, were very friendly, smiled a lot, well groomed, and professional.I had the crab cake and it was delicious. I just wish that they served more than one. You could definitely see crab with it's blend of herbs and spices. I also had the lamb chops, which were succulent. They were a good size too. On the side was cream style corn and mashed potatoes. ALL GOOD! My beau had the Le Coultre wings (which he shared with me) and the famous Lobster Mac and Cheese. He shared a little bit of that with me too. The lobster was very flavorful. It was a large fried to perfection lobster placed on a bed of mac-n-cheese. I'm not a cheese lover, but he absolutely loved it and plans on coming back real soon. They give you a lot of food which kind of make up for that one crab cake. They still need to add at least one more crab cake, though. Just a side note, I noticed in the pics of other customers, there was at least two crab cakes, so I am feeling somewhat jilted. They also give you complimentary crossants with a honey butter glaze, which was soooo delicious. I'm not a bread eater, but it was memorable.As were about to pay the bill, I did ask for a To Go cup, but they don't have that, so I finished off as much as I could of my Faygo Orange pop. Additionally, a vintage Faygo bottle. That's kind of cool. There's only one bathroom, so you might want to go before you come to the restaurant. Overall, my experience was good one, though, and I will be back!"
4 star rating,"I read that this place was rated in the top date places in the United States.  We placed a reservation on their website for us and our parents.  They had live music and a beautiful dining room with an opening to the kitchen to see our meals being built from scratch.  Mark was our server and he was phenomenal!  We celebrated our tenth anniversary there and plan on spending many more special events there.  The food, signature drinks, and service were so very exceptional!"
3.5 star rating,"I have waited a while to try out this restaurant due to it always been at capacity but it seems I wasn't missing out on anything. I experienced the worst customer service over the weekend. Waitress gave us water then didn't see her again for 40 mins until I had to ask another waitress to find her.. then we ordered wine and cocktail and our meals... 30 minutes later we get our food but still no drinks. Waited another 10 minutes before we got our drinks. I've made better food than this. The best thing was the mash potatoes. I never received one of my sides but it was still on my bill. I hoping for a good experience, good food and drinks. Definitely not worth patronizing or the over $100 tab."
1 star rating,"I have been working since I was 16 y/o. I've gone to college, and now I am well off into my career at 25 y/o. During the pandemic, I was laid off, and on unemployment. The owner of LeCulture chose to take to social media with comments about unemployed people during trying times. In my opinion, these type of comments are irresponsible and insensitive. Piece of sh*t? Whew. That's harsh. What a way to belittle and degrade the patrons of your business. I won't be spending my hard earned money here anymore. Very unfortunate, because I loved dining here and supporting this small black business... I'll take my POS $$ elsewhere."
1 star rating,"My sister and I had reservations for Le Culture so we did not wait to be seated, which was very pleasant! We sat at a tiny table, touching the wall. The space is space of limited but they're trying to work with that they've got: which is a really nice concept. A couple things stood out to me, the decor was a little mismatched; some of the chairs looked very cheap but the booth seating was beautifully crafted. My silverware did not match my sisters, so there was a little mismatch going on there, too. There is a small bar in the restaurant, but we didn't purchase any drinks this night. The bathroom was very clean and had a simplistic yet cute adornment. Our server's name was Jaz. She was absolutely amazing; very attentive and prompt!!!!My sister and I ordered the wings and the crab cakes for an appetizer and the house made strawberry lemonade to drink. I ordered the the lamb chops and broccolini for dinner, my sister ordered the chicken pasta. We shared the lobster mac n cheese. The crab cakes were divine, the wings came out on fire (that was a very unique presentation!) and they were tasty as well. The lamb chops and broccolini were delicious, my sister complained about her chicken pasta over and over again (but the staff did so their best to reconcile her complaints), and the mac n cheese was eh (the pictures of their social media looked waaaaay better). Overall, I would return to Le Culture to support and try their evolving menu but I was not WOWED on my first visit."
4 star rating,"Our reservation was for Saturday evening dinner. Although everyone in our dinner party had not arrived we were told we could not sit at the bar and order a drink because the bar area was full. We could not order a drink and wait for the rest of our party. We were escorted to the ""under renovation/construction"" side of the restaurant were other guests were waiting and visibly upset. Many upset over the very rude and very disrespectful comments made by the manager Nay to customers. She needs customer service skills. Pronto!!!The hostess(es) were friendly. The waitstaff were friendly. I forgot all of their names but some were more friendly than others. Gratuity was included in the bill but our dinner party   showed our appreciation by tipping those we felt deserved extra. We ordered drinks.  A lot of items they were ""out of."" The bartender was very friendly and accommodating recommending ""Birthday drinks"" that were very tasty.  Dishes/cutlery still had old food stuck on them. The portions of food are large. Very tasty but some overly salty. The music played throughout the evening is where I can give 5 stars."
1 star rating,"Read almost every review on here for them and still decided to check them out for myself. Glad I did! Great food, good drinks, and love the vibe. I wanted to try the cobbler but unfortunately they didn't have any left Customer service was awesome in spite of our waitress having to deal with a situation across from my guest and me. She handled herself with grace and kept a smile on her face! So kuddos to her! Cheers to black bottom coming back!"

5 star rating,"I made the reservation 4 weeks ago and I was not disappointed! It was amazing from start to finish. Jacob was our server and he did not disappoint. The hostess was great as well. I ordered the Salmon Tower and my husband ordered the Steak. We both shared our food with the other and omg next time I'm ordering the steak, even though my food was amazing. That steak is so delicious. I give it 5 stars. Go about 10 minutes earlier than your reservation time to secure a parking spot. I ordered dessert to go, we could not finish our food because of the generous portion sizes."
5 star rating,"I am SO SO SO SO DIssapointed. My girls and I drove 45 minutes here. We had a reservation so we were seated about 10 minutes after getting there. We ordered our drinks, and then our food. We were told that the kitchen is backed up so there will be a little wait. My friends got their alcoholic drinks 45 minutes after ordering it. After AN HOUR OF WAITING for our food we began growing impatient. We were watching people seated after us  get their food so we agreed to wait for another 30 minutes. ONE HOUR AND 30 mins passed and we still didn't get our food. At this point we made up our minds to leave. ONE HOUR AND FIFTY minutes later our food came out. We told our server to please send it back and give us our bill. They kept us updated and compensated our drinks but I still don't think it was enough. Never coming back. We left and went to White Castle (all dressed up) WOW!!!!!!"
1 star rating,Horrible service! The mac n cheese was hard and not warm. The drinks are small! The Cornish hen had no flavor! The greens taste like canned Glory greens !!!!   And the service was soooo slow! Just a waste of my money!
1 star rating,"From the onset, my daughter and I were pleased with the environment.  Very nice, urban feel and welcoming... wings are highly recommended to start with as an appetizer.  I ordered the Seafood Mac and Cheese.  It was presented beautifully and was piping hot! The taste was just as good as the presentation! The owner was also out on the floor checking on the customers.  I would have given LeCulture five stars but unfortunately our waitress terrible! She was super slow and inattentive.  What should have been 1 1/2 hours took 2 hours and 15 minutes! We had to wait for silverware, to-go boxes and her to return my credit card.  People who came in after us were served and left before we finished dining.  I recommend LeCulture and will be going back soon.  Hopefully, we will get a better waitress or that will be the last."

4 star rating,"Y'all. I had been stalking this joint on IG since they opened.  It's e only place I really wanted to go when I came home.  Before I continue the waitress was lovely but outside of that I was not impressed.  Went on Monday when they had the live music. I always enjoy a live music spot, but this place is really too small for that IMO, definitely not conducive to a conversational meal so keep that in mind.  I can't remember the name of my cocktail, but it was extremely sweet and absent of spirits.  I ordered the seafood mac & cheese and despite being described as having seafood throughout, that was not the case.  The mac itself was not at all mind blowing or creamy.  It was too sharp and unbalanced.  The lobster was disrespectful AF.  It tasted like it lived its life in dirty water only to be overcooked in some dirty grease with absolutely no thought to seasoning.  My final verdict:  severely overpriced hood chef shenanigans."
3.5 star rating,"I have been working since I was 16 y/o. I've gone to college, and now I am well off into my career at 25 y/o. During the pandemic, I was laid off, and on unemployment. The owner of LeCulture chose to take to social media with comments about unemployed people during trying times. In my opinion, these type of comments are irresponsible and insensitive. Piece of sh*t? Whew. That's harsh. What a way to belittle and degrade the patrons of your business. I won't be spending my hard earned money here anymore. Very unfortunate, because I loved dining here and supporting this small black business... I'll take my POS $$ elsewhere."
1 star rating,"My sister and I had reservations for Le Culture so we did not wait to be seated, which was very pleasant! We sat at a tiny table, touching the wall. The space is space of limited but they're trying to work with that they've got: which is a really nice concept. A couple things stood out to me, the decor was a little mismatched; some of the chairs looked very cheap but the booth seating was beautifully crafted. My silverware did not match my sisters, so there was a little mismatch going on there, too. There is a small bar in the restaurant, but we didn't purchase any drinks this night. The bathroom was very clean and had a simplistic yet cute adornment. Our server's name was Jaz. She was absolutely amazing; very attentive and prompt!!!!My sister and I ordered the wings and the crab cakes for an appetizer and the house made strawberry lemonade to drink. I ordered the the lamb chops and broccolini for dinner, my sister ordered the chicken pasta. We shared the lobster mac n cheese. The crab cakes were divine, the wings came out on fire (that was a very unique presentation!) and they were tasty as well. The lamb chops and broccolini were delicious, my sister complained about her chicken pasta over and over again (but the staff did so their best to reconcile her complaints), and the mac n cheese was eh (the pictures of their social media looked waaaaay better).

4 star rating,"This place is definitely a Vibe. Visited 3-14-20 around 8:30 pm w/o an reservation which I don't recommend but I had the time. Seating was almost 30 mins which we were advised. We sat at the bar which is small and intimate which I would have had issue with but like I mentioned this place is a Vibe. Which means it's real Detroit  with cool , hip, and laid back ppl. The food was flavored well I would recommend the macaroni have more cheese though. The lobster was season to perfection and how great is it to order wings as an appetizer and they automatically came fried hard... you know what type of establishment it is when u don't have to ask that! Sat immediately at the window and bar so I got the full panoramic view of the place. Staff was friendly, efficient, and cool. Will definitely return again... oh music was on"
4 star rating,"3 stars because my sister & I LOVE BRUNCH HERE!!! Dinner on the other hand... my husband & I have given this place two chances. Not worth it in my opinion. Today we went and in total we spent 3 hours there. Waited an hour for seating, an hour for our appetizers, drinks, and bread... another hour for our food and incorrect bill. We spent 250$ and the food was not completely worth it. The lobster corn dogs, my husband loved them! The culture wings, they tasted better when we had them on Valentine's Day The ""Lobster"" spinach dip, was missing the spinach and lobster. Although it was lacking both it tasted pretty goodThe rolls are amazing!!! The lamb chops.... we've had better, but they were okay.The mamba pasta with shrimp and chicken was okay! The Mac & Cheese was the only food besides the bread that was actually hot! Everything else was warm, which was very disappointing. My sister and I will probably be back for brunch, but we've given up on the dinner."
3 star rating,"Let me first say. I've heard a lot of mixed reviews on lLe Culture. And now let me say, if you had a bad experience. I'm sorry. I had a wonderful experience. The reason being, a lady named Sam. Her service was top tier and that's me being modest. If you eat at Le Culture, ask for Sam. She broke down the menu like it was the only thing she ever studied in her life! Gave me the pros and cons of everything before I took a real look at the menu. Sam = good time at Le Culture. The food was a good plus too. I had the Crab/Lobster cakes and boy. It was a lot of meat, fried so damn nice. It was some good ass corn sprinkled in as well. They brought some CRAZY glazed croissants too. I ain't even know that was in they package. Very fucking impressed. They lamb chops were also. MEATY AF! And if you like Brussel sprouts them was a hitter too. I'm on that salmon tower next. See y'all soon. And I'm reviewing.. again!"
5 star rating,"I ordered the Lobster mac + cheese it was delicious. I had my Lobster fried, the food was seasoned very well. The service was great, the only reason that I did not give 5 star's is due to them running out of their main desserts also food items on their instagram page was not available in the restaurant. Overall the service was great, I will patronize again."

1 star rating,"The atmosphere of this restaurant was very welcoming and warm. The staff was just as pleasant. The brunch menu had an excellent variety of flavors from lobster & crab grilled cheese, smothered chicken biscuit, and chicken & waffles. My pick was one of their most popular items, the seafood overload mac & cheese, my dining partner ordered another top dish, the seafood overload omelette. The mac & cheese is a five cheese blend with lump crab meat and a fried rock lobster tail on top. The lobster tail was so flavorful and fried to perfection. The mac & cheese had a good creamy consistency. The omelette was drenched in their house sauce, which was one of the best sauces I've ever had. The sauce is the boss! The food was so good that during our visit we went a second time before we headed back home to Chicago. We ordered the catfish & grits (came with chicken sausage) and salmon croquettes that came with gouda cheese grits. I added a side of cheese eggs and duck bacon, of which I never had so I was excited to try. The catfish & grits came drenched in that oh so delicious house sauce, we left nothing on the plate! The perfect bite: a piece of catfish, some grits and sauce, talk about a taste bud explosion! The salmon croquettes were my least favorite as well as the chicken sausage. The texture from the batter used to make the patty for the salmon was unsettling, it gave it a doughy taste and the chicken sausage had a strong bratwurst taste. I was looking for a breakfast sausage essence. The duck bacon was okay for my first try, I am sure it would have been a hit if it was maple flavored. Nonetheless the food at this restaurant is AMAZING and is a MUST TRY whenever you're in Detroit, MI!"
4 star rating,"Let me start by saying that BILLIE made this review possible. My husband and I were visiting from LA and found this upscale, BLACK OWNED, DELICIOUS Cafe. Unaware that you should reserve a table in advance to ensure they can seat you, we arrived like 45 minutes before it closed. A host (just doing her job & following protocol) informed us that they are no longer taking walk-ins. We were going to have to go elsewhere but BILLIE saw us and realized we were in town visiting for The NOI annual Saviours' Day Convention and she made room for us PBTA. Because of her act of kindness we were able to enjoy a wonderful meal in a gorgeous, chic yet rustic atmosphere. Food was GREAT & the service was EXCELLENT! We are so very appreciative of Billie and pray that Allah (God) continues to bless LeCulture Cafe with abundant success!"
5 star rating,"I had a reservation and when I got there, I was told there would be a 45 minute wait because they were short staffed. I looked around and not only was there no where  in the establishment for me and my party to wait for those ""45"" minutes, but the place was so small I wasn't sure if they ""were"" adequately staffed, there would be room to feel like we weren't sitting on top of one another. Definitely disappointing."
1 star rating,I went for brunch and had the Seafood Overload Omelette. It was delicious! I was greeted by everyone as soon as so walked in. My waitress was so nice.
3.5 star rating,"Many employees did not wear their masks properly during my visit. The distancing was a real shock to someone who has been out multiple times since the reopening of restaurants. Pretty tight space, if this is your first time out since reopening, you may want to consider takeout."
2 star rating,"Covid has absolutely NOTHING  to do with the horrible service received at this restaurant 05/29/21.... Literally sat at the table for about 15 min before got asked for drinks. She did bring bread without plates and no silverware though. Asked twice for plates. Finally ordered drinks and it took 15 min to bring a beer.  I asked for more napkins and those took about 20 min. We had to ask another server for boxes. And my bill was ready to go for 15 min while she continued to greet other people and make us wait. We'll most likely NEVER come to sit in this restaurant again. I'm actually sad to say that, I love it"
1 star rating,"This is no hole in the wall. The decor is nice, woody with black leather, beautiful tin work, and great lighting and music that was perfect for quiet dining. It's in a strip of old-time store fronts along Gratiot, right at Russell. Some empty offices, home to Trinosophes.Look, this food is delicious. We split the ribeye with three sides: Brussels, corn, and sweet potatoes. The steak was huge, tender, and fatty... perfect. The sides were all done with a nice combination of unique flair and home-cooked goodness.We'll be back. Well, well worth it."
5 star rating,While in town visiting family a cousin told me about this place and say that it was pretty good and she knows that I'm a bit of a foodie so I figured I'd give it a try. I will definitely say that I wasn't disappointed with what I ordered. I got the seafood omelette and there was definitely an abundance of seafood and the flavor was amazing. I will say that I was a little disappointed as far as the drink selection. They offered a few decent drinks but as far as getting a regular soda I feel they were asking too much especially with no refills. Customer service wasn't bad and I did not have to wait forever to get my food I'll say give it a try.
4 star rating,Everything was delicious. I ordered the salmon tower which was very tasty and tender. It wasn't spicy to me but it would be for someone with a low heat tolerance as it has a bit of a Cajun flare. As an appetizer I got the brussel sprouts...mmm mmm good!!! I really enjoyed them. The watermelon martini also was very testy and crept up on me. Lol. Overall it was a great experience. Fast service. Fear ambiance. I'd definitely go back.
5 star rating,"New restaurant near Eastern Market. Excellent food, wonderful ambiance. Food came out warm and was VERY tasteful. Our party ordered: Culture Wings, Crabcakes, Seafood Mac & Cheese, Lamb Chops, House Salad, Salmon Burger, Truffle Fries. Looking forward to coming back."
5 star rating,"I throughly enjoyed my dinner and service. Highly recommend making a reservation on Open Table. The food was all good and my drink was strong. No happy hour though. And before 6pm you cannot park on the street. There is a hidden parking lot in the back, it was difficult to find the restaurant from back there."

4 star rating,This place is lit. Very nice. Food great. I couldn't give the place 5 stars because you wait so long for the food. Otherwise I highly recommend this spot.
4 star rating,"Once or twice per year, I pick a really nice restaurant to take my amazing team to lunch as a way to celebrate their accomplishments and thank them for their outstanding work.  This year I chose LeCulture because of how close it is to our offices.  I REALLY REALLY wanted to love this place because I'd heard so many wonderful things about the menu. And to be fair, the food was very good, however, because I had a reservation, waiting nearly 45 minutes in stifling heat to place a lunch order was very upsetting. The upside was that My team enjoyed their meal.  I am going to give this place another shot simply because I want to see if they offer a better experience next time.  Fingers crossed, my next visit will be pleasant."
3.5 star rating,"I had hoped this place was gonna be good, but I was very disappointed. Very slow service even though my server was nice. My $15 lemon drop tasted like sour lemon juice. My lamb chops were over cooked and tuff. The lobster crab cab wasn't bad just over cooked. 3/4 of the way through my meal I finally got my sides (soggy broccoli bland truffle fries) The couple next to me said they were disappointed as well after a 4 month wait. They did take 25% off"
2 star rating,"This is based on our visit at this restaurant in April 2019.  I'm just now getting around to writing this review as I have been off YELP for a little while.  We had reservation and checked in on time.. needless to say we left without eating and waited over 45 minutes to experience the ""Fine Dining"" that everyone is raving about.  Going to this restaurant had to have been one of the most disappointing experiences we have had in a very long time especially downtown.  We waited almost a hour to place our order after we were seated.  We witnessed three tables be seated after us and they each placed their order and received their food.  Although we arrived there before many others were seated some of these tables were placing orders, eating, and receiving their drinks well before we were even acknowledged.  After the female manager noticed we had not been approached by one of the wait staff she came over and ask us had we been helped and if not she would be willing to take care of us from that point.  Because we had become extremely agitated with the entire ordeal we opted not to order any food. We felt it was best we leave.  The manager did cover the cost of our drinks and we then left.I did make mention of this on another social media site and after 2 weeks one of the owners responded with a ""What is it, you are seeking or what do you suggest we do"".  I never responded to his question.  I truly believe he could careless about what transpired that night as he has many happy patrons so one or two disappointed customers here or there mean nothing to them.   I am happy to see others enjoyed their food and their experience.No apologies needed.. !!"
2 star rating,"This place soothes my soul!!! When I tell you EVERY-THING on this menu is bangin'....BOOOOYYYY!The vibes, music, people...from the starters to the dessert all good! Bring an appetite! Better yet, order your meals and immediately ask for a carry out container so that you can put half of your food away to make room for dessert! Share with your date/friends and taste everything. Love this place! Take your time, talk, eat and enjoy Lê Culture! #ForThePeople"
5 star rating,"This is my first time coming here. I came with my girlfriend and her friends. Food came out in a timely manner. Taste was not all that. The kicker was that our friend ordered the pound and a half of the king crabs. Cost $75. No problem. But when it came out, she took one bite and it was super salty. She took another bite to see if she can deal with it and she couldn't. Asked the server to switch it to the lamb chops. She had the manager come out to speak to our friend. She tells her that she can trade it for the lamb chops and just pay for half of the crab legs. Ok cool. But no. The server came out and said that she would have to pay for half of the crab legs and the full amount of the lamb chops. Um, hell no! Not for 2 bites. They kept on trying to say that the owner said so. I made sure they understood that she was NOT GOING TO PAY for anything that she didn't like. They ultimately settled on giving her the lamb chops, which weren't that good either. But whatever. We sealed with it. Took it to go. Never will return again!"
1 star rating,"Love love LOVE this restaurant! Drew, the owner is quite connoisseur of customer service and creating grand experience. I've ordered just about everything on this menu and have no disappointments. I recommend it for date night or just an evening out. The ambiance can be loud at times but it isn't bad. They do music on Mondays, which is enjoyable. The weekend is very busy so pack your patience if you don't have a reservation but order a Sidecar or the Gratiot and you will be too drunk to remember how long you waited."

4 star rating,"So I love the food here. This is my second time eating here and the food is literally so delicious. The issue is that the staff is not welcoming at all, and the wait time is extreme. My waiter was very nice, but everyone else has attitudes. You have to plan your visit to last around 2.5 hours because it takes so long. Again the food is amazing"
3 star rating,"The salmon burger was so good!!!! Definitely try it, You won't be disappointed. I'm only giving them 4 stars because the staff have little attitudes but it's not extreme. The wings are pretty good, not the best. They have items that aren't on the menu so definitely ask what else is available. Also, it's a reservation only place so make sure you make one"

4 star rating,"The inside is unassuming but the food was fresh and plentiful. We went to brunch and I tried the salmon croquettes and grits. I couldn't finish it all so i have another meal. They use fresh instead of canned salmon, grits were creamy and eggs fluffy. My friend had the seafood overload omelette and pancakes.  I will be back!"
4 star rating,"I really enjoyed my visit to the culture cafe. The ambiance was cool, the staff was great and the signature drinks were delicious. Our reservation was for later in the night so that could be why our food was okay. The wings were awesome, I had the chicken  pasta which was okay, and my sis had the lobster mac and cheese which she liked (i have a shellfish allergy) . The whipped potatoes were okay as well. I would go back on a different day and try some other menu items. I guess for the price I was looking for incredible flavors marrying in my mouth. And while I didnt get that on this trip i feel that they are totally capable of making it happen."
4 star rating,"There's only one word to describe the food....DELICIOUS!!!!!! Everything was great!! Our waiter, RaSool was AWESOME!! He recommended that me and my 2 friends order different entrées and share. Im so glad that we did because we were able to taste so much deliciousness....!!!! Our entrées came out of the kitchen piping hot before we could finish our appetizer, which was an A+++++!!! Oh, the Lobster Macaroni, Mmmmmmmm, SOOO GOOD!!! The cocktails were great as well! This restaurant is great and it's worth every pennie. This is my #1 spot!!!"
3.5 star rating,"Well I came here on a date and it did not disappoint. Great food. I mean great, started with the crab cakesBut the waiter convinced me to get wings instead and he was right. They came out on fire and it was an amazing presentation, but I was afraid they would be too spicy but they were the right amount of spice and sweet. Then I got the lamb chops w Mac n cheese and both were good. However my date got the loaded seafood crab and lobster Mac n cheese(it looked like my next meal next time I'm there ). It was an amazing dish, the perfect combo. I didn't like that they didn't have an alcoholic drink menu, we didn't even know they had alcoholic beverages until we were past half way there.Overall loved it. Can't wait to go back."
5 star rating,"Overall it's a 2.5, but since that's not an option I'll go with a 3. The Good: Service in general was excellent, my waiter was very attentive to our needs and as prompt as he could be, so 5 stars to him (forgot his name), My lamb chops were cooked exactly how I like (medium rare) and very tasty.The Bad: Seated by the door, where whenever someone entered or exited we got a terrible draft (waiter eventually moved us.), The croissants were warmed in the microwave which made them tough to bite and very chewy, The wait for our food was a bit outrageous (47min) considering we only received 2 inedible croissants (keep in mind nobody eats before going to dinner.). Upon receiving our food everything except the Mac and cheese was room temperature (nobody likes cold food.) While I don't have a problem paying for a good meal I feel like you were to pricey considering the wait for and room temperature food. I've heard some great reviews from friends so either they don't know good eating as I do or maybe you guys just had a bad night, but consistency is a must, I'd like the same experience as I've read others have had."
3 star rating,This place is a True Gem!!!  I had the Lamb Chops that's just melted in your mouth. My wife had the Chicken & Shrimp Alfredo which was to die for ... The Peach Cobble was Insane the flavor just was the best . Definitely will be Back!
5 star rating,"I was excited to finally get to try LeCulture!  However I ended up slightly disappointed. The ambiance was nice .... but the food was just OK. I had the seafood Mac & cheese.  The seafood did not taste as fresh as it could've been. I am a BIG seafood lover and I can definitely taste the difference.  My waitress was nice ... but when my friend and I got ready to pay our bill our change was shorted by a couple of dollars... and her excuse was they round the bill up -_-  really ???? I mean it was only a couple of dollars but how dare you ?  Give me my correct change and I'll tip you out of that !!! Another thing I didn't like is that there is one restroom with 1 toilet for men and women to share ... I went and asked where it was and I guy told me ""oh it's out of order ""   So then a lady came up behind him , pulled the out of order off the door and said ""oh I fixed it "". So my thing is .. if I had reservations a half hr earlier and had to use the restroom... I couldn't ??? That's not acceptable!! Sorry to say that I probably won't be back ...... the food was overpriced for just OK food $26 for the Mac & cheese .. and $13 for the hard lemonade that you needed at least  3 of to even catch a slight buzz.  If you do try this place... try something other than the Mac , and make sure you count your change !!"
3 star rating,"I was extremely disappointed in the service. Made a reservation a month in advance, seated right away and given appetizer fairly quickly. Then waited an hour for entrees which were never received. The waiter was inattentive and only promised our dishes were on the way after we flagged him down repeatedly. Several tables were served the same dishes we ordered even though they arrived after us. Management made no attempts to rectify the issue. Left hungry and highly aggravated. Ruined Valentine's day for my husband and I.P.S. Instead of reaching out to resolve your concerns they just block you. If you choose to try it....Good Luck!"
1 star rating,"So! Leculture's music and food is what sold this place for me! Great music, great ambiance, the Mac n cheese and LeCulture wings are fantastic!! We were seated immediately which is contrary to the other reviews. Place your reservations people! I will say the layout could use some amending, we were seated next to the main door which during this time of the year, was not very favorable.  The service was not bad but it was not fantastic either, we did have to wait on our server for about 15 minutes however after we got the wheels turning, there was no wait for anything. Overall, great place"
4 star rating,"I really want to give 5 stars! But....... here we go. My reservation was for 8:30. My husband and I were seated promptly. Then the fun begins. We saw no greeter, no waitress for 30 minutes. No water, drink order, nothing. A woman comes to our table and apologizes. She brings us water and takes our drink order. We wait another 10 minutes. The table opposite from us, who arrived AFTER us gets their appetizers. The waitress(I'm guessing that's who she was, cause she never gave us a name) came back and asked what was our drink order again!  We tell her. She comes back 10 minutes later. She then gets our food orders. Meanwhile, the opposite table gets there food. She brings us some bread. So. 30 minutes later a woman comes out with Lambchops. Not mine nor my husbands. She goes back and then another young lady comes to apologize. She comps our drinks and tells us our food is coming out in the next 5 minutes. It does. And it's phenomenal! That's the ONLY reason why I'm giving 3 stars. The food is to die for!!! I had the seafood overload Mac and cheese. Hubby had the Ribeye cooked medium well. So much crab and lobster! No extra seasoning needed. Hubby didn't need steak sauce at all!!!!! We may give this place another try. But note to the owners.... HIRE NEW STAFF!!!!!!"
3 star rating,After walking in without seeing a hostess for over 10 mins a  too check in I should of know it would be downhill from there. I made a reservation over two weeks out and when I arrived at 7:30 is was crowded and they said they had no cancellations so it would be a 30 min wait for our reservation. Which is unacceptable! To even be overbooking a restaurant during Covid-19. When I looked inside the dining room it was crowded and not abiding by Covid-19 policies. We eventually just left. We tried to give them another try but I have nothing good to say about the restaurant and after all the bad press from the owner you would of think the would be on top of they service don't waste your time or money. If you looking for a black restaurant just go to Savannah Blue instead.
1 star rating,"My first time and I must say from beginning until the end an absolutely WONDERFUL dining experience! Everything on the menu looked great and the entrees we had were ALL delicious! Regina was our waitress, she was wonderful as well. I will definitely return!"
5 star rating,Look I will never ever come to this place again in my life!!!! My wire and I looked so forward to dining f at this establishment for 3 months and we are DEFINITELY DISAPPOINTED!!!! The food was ok at best and SURELY OVERPRICED.  We received our appetizer after our entree.  The Salmon Tower didn't come with what was advertised and the Supposed Overloaded Mac & Cheese also didn't come with the advertised sea food additions.  $180 WAS A TOTAL WASTE!!!!  I tried to support this establishment BUT NEVER EVER AGAIN WILL I DINE AT THIS PLACE!!!!
3.5 star rating,"Good food is not enough. The experience starts at the door. We had a 4PM reservation which apparently is when the restuarant opens. We arrived at 3:55PM and were asked to wait outside in subfreezing temperatures along with two other patrons. One of which was a senior on a walker! A bit of advice, if you begin seating at 4PM your doors should open at least by 3:30PM. Furthermore, your patrons should never have to wait outside in the cold because your staff is not ready at 3:55.Once we were allowed in and seated a whole other experience began. The tables are too close together. Multiple times I was bumped by other patrons and wait staff moving about the dining area. A couple of times while eating, I experienced the waitresses rear end in my personal space while she was serving the tables next to us. That's always a negative for me. As well as the lack of attention our waitress provided us considering how small the space is and the number of tables she was serving.  The hostess talking on her cell phone was also a disappointment considering the lact of attention we received during our visit.The food had really good flavor. The only downside was that the meat we ordered was not cooked to the temperature we requested. In comparison to another recent fine dining experience I had the price points were the same, but the level of service I received elsewhere far exceeded what I experienced at LeCulture cafe.  There is a great opportunity for improvement. If I had been awed by my experience I would not hesitate to spend another $150 on a meal here again really soon. That being said, hopefully this feedback falls on receiving ears and improvements are made before my next visit."
2 star rating,"This is my third time going here and every time I go it's so delicious! The food is always on point! It's made to order so it's always fresh and hot. I got the lobster Mac and cheese with seafood overload again this time. The drinks area so good too. My favorite is the Blue-Rita. It don't know what's in it but its scrumptious with some Tito's and pineapple Ciroc, apple pucker and some other things!  The bartender/waitress/cashier, I think her name was Shelly, was awesome as always! She is always so efficient and pleasant. I will be back again and AGAIN!!"
5 star rating,"FIRST OFF, I would like to say that I HAVE NEVER EVER REVIEWED ANYTHING ONLINE EVER, but LE CULTURE HAS LEFT ME NO CHOICE. Don't YALL EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER COME HERE. FOR ANYTHING. DONT STOP TO USE THE BATHROOM, DONT ASK FOR WATER, DONT STOP!!! IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS, FAMILY OR NEIGHBORS THAT MENTIONS GOING TO THIS PLACE OUTTA THE DEEP LOVE THAT HAVE FOR THEM AND RESPECT FOR THEIR MONEY SLAP THEM!  I have never in my life experienced such horrendous service. First, our waitress took 45 minutes to address our table. After bringing us water, which took another 20 minutes, she walked away and that was pretty much the last time we saw her that evening. IT TOOK 2 hours for someone to take our orders and that was done by the bartender. After placing our orders, it took another 1 hour for us to get our food. Our food didnt come out at the same time. The food was thoroughly DISAPPOINTING. I ordered the lamb chops, which were undercooked, and my friend ordered the seafood overload. I always believed that macaroni was a dish that nearly impossible to mess up. I am sorry to report that that's not true. This place has managed to mess up one of the simplest dishes. It was mushy and had entirely TOO much cheese. Their service was not friendly, and the only compensation we received was a free drink and cheese cake. They are LIARS also! I asked for the manager, and was ran around in circles. One person said that they would get the manager, and another stated the manager was not there. Turns out, she was working, and never came to our table. The second waitress we had stated she couldn't take off any of our food, but proceeded to remove our drink from the bill. That didn't add up. This doesn't even scratch the surface of what a horrible experience I had on my BIRTHDAY, by the way, but I just want to help someone save their hard earned money. If they don't change their services and chef soon, they will not last another two months."
1 star rating,"First time visiting this place, it was my sons 15th birthday!   We had reservations for 8 people we did have to wait for like an additional 15mins in a designated waiting area. The Host was super nice and very welcoming. We ordered our food it was delicious everyone liked their food no complaints. We got some bomb.com honey butter crescent rolls. Our waiter Jamin was very patient and nice the entire evening and kept us updated on food that was still being brought out. He checked on us periodically making sure our party was satisfied and had a good time. Very intimate and homely feel to restaurant environment. Kinda pricey menu but in my opinion well worth it. I'll be revisiting soon."
5 star rating,"We had a very enjoyable experience sitting at the bar.   Mechalle was great and all of our food was very good. While we observed much of what others complained about,  this seems to be growing pains.   As long as you're not in a hurry,  it is not really an issue.   While it is obvious that they can have a little issue with the volume,  the important things are maintained.   The kitchen does not take shortcuts to get food out quickly and the staff,  while clearly overly busy,  all seem to care. We were particularly impressed that dishes that are inherently rich and often come out heavy,  these versions here are both highly flavorful and seemingly light. Suggest that the chef considers adding duck bacon to the loaded mac and cheese."
5 star rating,Food was great but they need to work on the service. They should maybe hire professional waiter and waitress.   The wait was long to even get bread and a dAlso should have parking   But again the food was excellent
4 star rating,Food was great but they need to work on the service. They should maybe hire professional waiter and waitress.   The wait was long to even get bread and a drink. Also should have parking   But again the food was excellent had the Salmon Tower it was great
4 star rating,OK .. I'm going to look over the bright bright lights because the vibe is the best. Ordered a vegan salad.... While waiting they served a complementary plate of bread.. croissant in honey. Very good.  Good bar selection. The salad is awesome... Quick to arrive. Crab cakes also very good.  Two recomendations 1. Stop by and enjoy the food and vibe. 2. The owner needs to invest in some  dimmers!
5 star rating,"My experience was awesome! We arrived about 15 minutes early and was seated immediately. Our server Jamin was ""Johnny on the spot"" he was prompt and attentive, even asked us if we were celebrating a birthday or anything so we could be acknowledged. The food was hot, delicious and tastefully displayed. The servings were so large we have food for lunch tomorrow. The dining experience exceeded my expectations, I will be back and I'm going to recommend this restaurant to everyone. Great job!"
5 star rating,"First time being here.. the space in Downtown Detroit, small and elegant, not in a location you would think, you could possibly drive pass it. but hey once you find the spot!!! Nice service, I had a 7:45pm reservation,  it wasn't full to capacity, but if it were, you would be cramp, so keep that in mind, trying to entertain a large group would be annoying, but the food was delicious, I had the salmon tower.... it was worth the price ( get a side of bread)..it's a worth trying!! It's nice casual dress place, you can get fancy if you want!! I definitely would go back"
4 star rating,"The best brussels sprouts I've ever had! Le Culture Cafe lived up to all the buzz surrounding it's opening. The ""seafood tower"" or maybe it's called the ""salmon tower"" either way it's excellent; would reccomend to anyone who enjoys seafood. The decor and embiance is very cool and unique and the service was good but could be great with some fine tuning."
3.5 star rating,"First time here. Food was pretty good. Creamy corn was on point. I had mac and cheese seafood overload. Plenty of seafood and season. Enjoyed every bite. Pleasant services and nice atmosphere. Hostess Billie treated us real well, very friendly."
5 star rating,"The food was amazing the wait was not but I was with a friend so easily forgot. The server was okay they need better training (was unaware of liquor) but she was cool and very nice. Great portion size, very very very intimate setting."
5 star rating,"Finally was able to visit here and so happy that I did!! The menu is not huge but trust me you will want everything on it! We tried the crab cakes and the wings and both were very good. I had the Oscar LeCulture(it's not on the menu) and my husband had pasta with chicken and shrimp. When I tell you the food was AMAZING!!! My steak was cooked perfect and melted in my mouth, it was so flavorful!! You get good portions also, the truffle fries came in a huge bowl!!!!  Please note this is a cafe so seating a little tight but its very nice and there is some seating against the windows and on the day we were there it was cold(it was 3 degrees outside though). They have only been open a few months so I know things are still coming together and hope they continue with the great food but I do hope they service stays good. The waitress we had was not the best but she did make sure to tell us she was not actually a waitress but a bartender, we had to ask for silverware(because of her and the lack of parking options is why I didn't give it 5 stars). I do reccommend giving it a try!!"
4 star rating,Amazing food amazing service it's a small restaurant but a very cozy restaurant. the staff were friendly and helpful. Definitely would recommend this place to friends and family.
5 star rating,"Nice, new spot in the Eastern Market area. This is an all around type of venue. Meaning, date night, family dinner, hanging out with friends, it's a go for all of these here. Atmosphere is cool. Dimming the lights a tad bit would step the ambience up by 100%. Food was good, won't review service and food times until I visit again. We came for the soft opening so kinks were still being worked out. Our server had a good listening ear and the chef catered to our specific requests. A must try. Will return."
5 star rating,I am a frequent customer here and before the shut down I have always enjoyed my food. The last three visits were not so great. The employees are amazing but the food is not great anymore. I had a seafood pizza my last visit and a salmon tower this time around and sadly I was disappointed. Maybe its the cooks that are there since the food is not worth the money anymore.
2 star rating,"****PARK IN THE REAR*****The staff was friendly and attentive. Had The Culture cocktail and it was delicious! Had the brussel sprouts app and the were good just a lil overcooked, I love a char but not a burnt taste. It's usually the loose leaves that can go over fast. Anywho, I ordered the lamb chops w/Mac & Cheese and a side of grilled chicken breast that I wanted to incorporate into my Mac. My chops were tender and flavorful and the Mac was delicious!!My only complaints are that my food was not put in as TO GO so my food was bought to me at the bar and then had to travel back to the kitchen and my chicken was not added to my Mac as I requested but It wasn't an end of the world mistake so I will definitely be back! Oh & get yourself some of their Strawberry Lemonade as well.After leaving, I heard from a friend ... THEY ARE RELOCATING!! SOON!!!!!OWNERS....EMPLOYEES...this would be a good tidbit of information to pass along to your Patrons!!! I'm jus saying"
4 star rating,My food was excellent and I will be returning! It was for my birthday they complimented me with the black bottom cheesecake. Appetizers was the Leculture Wing's that came on fire! Me and my bestfriend had the entrees Mamba Pasta with Chicken and the Seafood Mac and Cheese with fried lobster tail! My food was seasoned and ho which excites me! Anytime I have to wait for my food to cool off and salivate is a GOOD SIGN! Period! Thanks for the experience! Keep the same momentum please! Perfect to the Eastern Market vibe
5 star rating,"Wife and I went for brunch. She had the seafood overload omelette that came with a pancake, and I had steak and eggs that came with potatoes and a pancake. We both had mimosas hers was watermelon, mine was traditional. Overall the food was great, great ambiance, service was better than decent, drink were okay. Definitely wanna go back for the dinner menu. Be prepared to spend a pretty penny if you wanna eat good! With the things I listed above came about to about $80."
4 star rating,"They literally had NOTHING ! They were out of the Beyond Burger, which the waitress said THEY NEVER HAD and she's been working here since they opened, they were out of broccoli, Brussels sprouts, no blueberries, no sweet potatoes, the chicken and waffles is just one big breast. I asked for vegetarian options and the waitress offered a steak or lamb chops....this was by far the WORST experience EVER & truly showed it's ""black ownership"" quality! They can't handle their walk ins and they run out of food??! Meanwhile, the owner makes it seem like it's all put together, per his social media....What a misconception! Don't go here expecting the following items because they will more than likely be OUT!"
3.5 star rating,"Let me start by saying that BILLIE made this review possible. My husband and I were visiting from LA and found this upscale, BLACK OWNED, DELICIOUS Cafe. Unaware that you should reserve a table in advance to ensure they can seat you, we arrived like 45 minutes before it closed. A host (just doing her job & following protocol) informed us that they are no longer taking walk-ins. We were going to have to go elsewhere but BILLIE saw us and realized we were in town visiting for The NOI annual Saviours' Day Convention and she made room for us PBTA. Because of her act of kindness we were able to enjoy a wonderful meal in a gorgeous, chic yet rustic atmosphere. Food was GREAT & the service was EXCELLENT! We are so very appreciative of Billie and pray that Allah (God) continues to bless LeCulture Cafe with abundant success!"
5 star rating,"I'm here from out of town and i am so impressed! Me and my family chose to get a few different things and share so we could sample multiple items. We ate the Culture Wings, Seafood Overload Mac&Cheese, and the Roasted Root Vegetable salad and it was all AMAZING! The actual venue is so trendy and cute! Staff was friendly. Everything was great! I will be back again!"
5 star rating,Terrible service Waited 30 mins for the seafood Mac and cheese and it came out cold.Offered us the breakfast platter only to tell us they were out of some items.Messed up one of our orders then said the kitchen was closed so one person had nothing to eat.No parking.This place sucks.
1 star rating,"The atmosphere of this restaurant was very welcoming and warm. The staff was just as pleasant. The brunch menu had an excellent variety of flavors from lobster & crab grilled cheese, smothered chicken biscuit, and chicken & waffles. My pick was one of their most popular items, the seafood overload mac & cheese, my dining partner ordered another top dish, the seafood overload omelette. The mac & cheese is a five cheese blend with lump crab meat and a fried rock lobster tail on top. The lobster tail was so flavorful and fried to perfection. The mac & cheese had a good creamy consistency. The omelette was drenched in their house sauce, which was one of the best sauces I've ever had. The sauce is the boss! The food was so good that during our visit we went a second time before we headed back home to Chicago. We ordered the catfish & grits (came with chicken sausage) and salmon croquettes that came with gouda cheese grits. I added a side of cheese eggs and duck bacon, of which I never had so I was excited to try. The catfish & grits came drenched in that oh so delicious house sauce, we left nothing on the plate! The perfect bite: a piece of catfish, some grits and sauce, talk about a taste bud explosion! The salmon croquettes were my least favorite as well as the chicken sausage. The texture from the batter used to make the patty for the salmon was unsettling, it gave it a doughy taste and the chicken sausage had a strong bratwurst taste. I was looking for a breakfast sausage essence. The duck bacon was okay for my first try, I am sure it would have been a hit if it was maple flavored. Nonetheless the food at this restaurant is AMAZING and is a MUST TRY whenever you're in Detroit, MI!"
4 star rating,Love how the owner kept with the original architect and enhance the building's natural beauty. it is a very cozy restaurants with excellent staff the food was beyond delicious. I had the macaroni and cheese loaded and my son had a steak we had the broccolini and everything was delicious. I enjoyed that they had Faygo pop in the original bottle. I would definitely recommend this for a lovey intimate dinner or for a girls night out
5 star rating,"Beware of takeout orders...!!!!! I have been to this restaurant 3 times before the pandemic and the food was good. This weekend was my first time ordering take  out and the food was TRASHHHH! I ordered a salmon tower which comes with salmon lobster and shrimp, however I didnt have any lobster in my order and only two shrimp . My side of creamy corn was disgusting and over cooked ...the food was overall was cold when I picked it up ... not to mention they got my order wrong and I had to go back in and pick up my actual order just for the food to be nasty. I really should've took it back but I was already home when I started eating it .. this meal was in celebration of my bf birthday and we didn't even enjoy our food . I'm very disappointed, definitely not worth the $100 we spent !!!!"
3 star rating,"Service is horrific! I placed my To-go order at 6:34pm on Sunday. I drove all the way downtown and didn't arrive until 7:39 (an hour later) and my order STILL wasn't ready! They told me they would call and if they haven't, it's not ready! I only had two orders of Chicken wings and fries! Guess what? They never even called, EVER, to tell me my order was ready. I never ate, I wasted time and money."
1 star rating,The food was good. The service both times I've been was terrible! Asked the server to see a manager and she said no one was there.....ok!! For the money that you spend at this place the service needs to reflect that.
2 star rating,"Terrible service!! Our reservation was at 10pm, it took us a minute to be seated. Once we got to our table it took them 20 minutes to take our order. It wasn't really busy so I don't know why it took them so long. Also it took about 35 minutes to get our food. We literally ate for ten minutes and left. The food is good but the service is terrible."
1 star rating,I've visited on more than 5 occasions. Brunch is gross but the dinner here is good. Service is extremely slow and not worth the wait. I would go back in the future if they revamped the entire breakfast menu and had faster service.
3.5 star rating,"My first time eating here was last Friday. My date ordered the Lobster Mac and said it was perfect. I however, ordered the bone-in Ribeye- Medium well. The first time it was brought out, it was cooked perfectly. However, the cut was NOT a bone-in Ribeye. It looked to be more of a porterhouse. The sauce, I thought, was overwhelmingly salty. I sent it back and asked for the sauce to be placed on the side. It took nearly 30 minutes to get a replacement. And when it finally came, it was well done and more salty than the original. Aside from my steak and the time it took, which I just asked that it be removed from the bill and didn't take anything- the staff was incredibly unwelcoming. Everyone that made eye contact seemed to want to get into a staring match. No smiles. No hello. Nothing. Only the manager upon entering and our server the first time she came to the table. I may give it a second shot, only because I was so hopeful"
2 star rating,"Ok, soooooo....you walk in and with no reservations we were able to get a table on a Friday night. We sit down and waited about 15 minutes before any wait staff would even acknowledge that we were sitting there. We had to flag down the person who sat us to find our waitress. Waited another 10 minutes for her to bring our water, yet our bar made drinks were ready before the water. Whatever. After that, we ordered. I ordered the Seafood Overload Mac&Cheese.w"" With a side of Broccolini. Ohhhhhh Myyyyyy Gooddddddd. When I tell you this food, all of it, was amazing. I put the Mac and cheese in my mouth and next thing I know my toes curled up and I was this close to passing out! Soooo goodddddd. The lobster was fried, seasoned to perfection. The broccoli was yummy. Seasoned wonderfully, also made my toes curl slightly. Drinks... I ordered the Sweet Georgia. Buzz achieved! Overall, a nice place. Nice vibe, excellent music, staff friendly, but like I said just be ready to wait a bit for your waitress."
4 star rating,"1st time going, it took about an hour for food to come out. Decided to give it another try this past Saturday evening. Took my girlfriend, who were here from Chicago. Horrible experience...my food arrived, I started eating after 10 minutes,  I inquired how long before her food come. I was told 5 minutes. 10 more minutes went past, so I inquired again. I was told 5min. After 15 minutes they brought it out. By then, we just told them to put it in a carryout container. They took it off the bill. I won't be going back. So disappointed."
2 star rating,"I was excited to finally get to try LeCulture!  However I ended up slightly disappointed. The ambiance was nice .... but the food was just OK. I had the seafood Mac & cheese.  The seafood did not taste as fresh as it could've been. I am a BIG seafood lover and I can definitely taste the difference.  My waitress was nice ... but when my friend and I got ready to pay our bill our change was shorted by a couple of dollars... and her excuse was they round the bill up -_-  really ???? I mean it was only a couple of dollars but how dare you ?  Give me my correct change and I'll tip you out of that !!! Another thing I didn't like is that there is one restroom with 1 toilet for men and women to share ... I went and asked where it was and I guy told me ""oh it's out of order ""   So then a lady came up behind him , pulled the out of order off the door and said ""oh I fixed it "". So my thing is .. if I had reservations a half hr earlier and had to use the restroom... I couldn't ??? That's not acceptable!! Sorry to say that I probably won't be back ...... the food was overpriced for just OK food $26 for the Mac & cheese .. and $13 for the hard lemonade that you needed at least  3 of to even catch a slight buzz.  If you do try this place... try something other than the Mac , and make sure you count your change !!"
3 star rating,Went to LeCulture for my birthday in April 2019. Food was amazing. Went recently and the prices were through the roof. Did not stay as not affordable. Why do Black owned restaurants increase their prices. There was hardly anybody there and that could be the reason. Sorry to say I will not be back
1 star rating,"Read almost every review on here for them and still decided to check them out for myself. Glad I did! Great food, good drinks, and love the vibe. I wanted to try the cobbler but unfortunately they didn't have any left Customer service was awesome in spite of our waitress having to deal with a situation across from my guest and me. She handled herself with grace and kept a smile on her face! So kuddos to her! Cheers to black bottom coming back!"

4 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place forever, and I finally got the chance to go for a Saturday morning brunch last weekend. I made reservations, so we were seated right away. My son and I were a little over dressed, though. I was in a dress, and he was in dress slacks and shirt, but everyone else was in jeans or other casual clothes. Maybe people dress up more in the evening? Anyway, brunch here is casual in case you're wondering what to wear. Service was great, although they do warn you that there will be a wait as everything is made from scratch. No problem. It was worth the wait (and it really wasn't that long, anyway).Their brunch menu is large and unique. I had a hard time deciding what to get from so many tempting options, but I went with the shrimp and grits. Omg. Heaven on a plate. The grits are made with gouda cheese and are the best grits I've ever had. My son enjoyed his chicken and bacon rollup sandwich and fries. Parking here might be tricky on a busy night, but early on a Saturday morning I was able to park right in front of the restaurant. Highly recommend for a memorable meal."
5 star rating,"Food was seasoned well but came out cold, I ordered the salmon tower and broccoli. Wait staff is very attentive. Good environment, good music. But it's overpriced and over rated and the seating was awkward. Had a 9:45 reservation and was seated promptly. Food took a while to come out that's why I didn't bother sending it back."
3 star rating,"After hearing mixed reviews about this place it was my turn to have the LeCulture experience. I dined in on a weekday(Wednesday evening). When I arrived I was promptly greeted and asked if I had a reservation, we did.  The decor reminds me of an old bar turned into a restaurant, it works though.We were seated at a half booth/table. Water was placed before me without a lemon which I appreciate greatly! *I hate lemon in water when it's not requested. Jamin was our waiter, he was extremely pleasant and greeted us each time with a smile and was very attentive. We ordered the LeCulture wings as an appetizer. Not long after a plate of all flats was presented. The wings looked as if they came from a regular chicken and not one that was in a body building competition. A+. The wings were presented on a plate with flambé'. Neat. What I appreciated was that Jamin asked about a peanut allergy which is noted on the menu but I was pleased that he asked. The honey butter croissants weren't anything to get excited about. I felt like I was eating a croissant bought in bulk from Sams Club, that was heated up with honey butter. I ordered the Bone in Ribeye (which only comes in one size),a side of Mac & cheese and the Broccolini. The steak was a nice size in regards to thickness, I ordered it prepared med-well and it was cooked perfectly. The taste is reminiscent of the J. Alexander's Steak Maui. The accompanying mashed potatoes were a tad dense but seasoned just right. No complaints about my main course. The side of Mac and Cheese is really for two people. It was brought in small cast iron skillet. Creamy and lots of cheese but not the taste I expected. It was nothing to excite me. The broccolini was topped with parm and was tough to cut, it could've been steamed a little long but the color was poppin and the taste was good.The food portions were so large that I asked for a carry out container right away to put most of the food away for a treat the day after. I ordered The Gratiot which comes in at $25! It was NICE! Finally, I decided on the Black Bottom cheesecake. I think it may have been my least favorite of all the food I tried. Loved the presentation but nothing really tickled my tastebuds. Unisex restrooms, clean and good mirrors. It's wheelchair accessible but small on the inside. Good lighting. GREAT playlist! I mean myself and another patron jammed the whole time! All in all LeCulture proved to be a nice experience. Based on other things I've heard I probably would never go on a weekend.  The service was great, most of food was good, I would like to go back and try a few other dishes. I most definitely would get The Gratiot again lol."
4 star rating,"When you walk into the space, you feel a good vibe. There's bumpin' music, young patrons, vibrant servers, all of this makes for a positive experience, especially on a girls night out. What I will say about the food is that it is indulgent. The featured ""grain"" that is served at the table is a croissant drenched in a sugary honey concoction. My girls loved them and ordered extra (for an extra charge of course). I thought it was too sweet to start out my meal and if you didn't eat it when it was warm, no bueno.For appetizers, we ordered crab cakes, culture wings and steak bites. The crab cakes (see pic) were not great - a bit rubbery and too much filler/breading. The steak bites were tasty-well seasoned and cooked properly. The wings (see pic) are served in the ""Hastings"" sauce (menu items feature several tributes/references to the Black Bottom neighborhood) and set aflame on the table. A lot of show and no go. Wings were tasty enough, but for $12, I'll pass. I'm a VERY discerning wing connoisseur. I liked the fact that they're small and naked. The sauce was nothing to ride down Hastings for. One of my girls and I ordered the lamb chops with a side of brussel sprouts (see pic). Both orders were cooked under. I ordered medium and she ordered well. I got medium rare and she got medium. Still, they were seasoned nicely, simmered in a wonderful sauce. I couldn't eat them all anyway and they were perfect heated up in the microwave the next day. The brussel sprouts were not that impressive. Would rather have a serving of tender green beans sautéed in garlic n olive oil or something.  Ready for the brussel sprout trend to end.I tried another friend's chicken mamba pasta. That was good. I would order it the next time. I also tried the Mac n cheese with fried lobster. A lil indulgent for my taste as a meal, but was delicious to try. My girlfriend enjoyed it. The cocktails - they featured a watermelon vodka cooler. It was yummy, but overpriced at $12. Then when I saw the plastic cooler of pre-made watermelon juice/Koolaid at the bar, it cheapened it. Also, I can't believe they feature so many top dollar ($40+) protein options and don't have a decent wine list! This kills me. At least offer a nice Cabernet if you're going to get me for $40 for lamb chops. It's like wearing a Valentino dress with some shoes from Aldo. I mean, you can do it, but,....The service was good. Food was a bit slow coming out of the kitchen, but we were full on apps and chatting quite a bit. Our server was nice and high energy. But then again, they do tack a 20% service charge onto the bill. This was no problem because we all planned to tip. Just maybe a delicate notification of that by the server before ordering might have been more diplomatic? Some members of my party didn't like it at all. Overall, this spot is solid. I will return. It's a fun space. Plan to spend $100 easily for dinner. Not sure if the price points are on point. They need to tighten up to justify those prices if they want to be around in the long run. I'll support though and hope to see growth."
3.5 star rating,First time eating here. Service was good. Atmosphere was pleasant. Had an issue with my lamb chops and I didn't want to send them back but the waitress insisted so I did. I like how she had too make it right. Sides are large enough to share. The only negative I have is that I wished the menu was explained some. The ribeye comes with mashed potatoes so don't order French fries. The wings come out flaming and looked delicious.
4 star rating,"Ok, soooooo....you walk in and with no reservations we were able to get a table on a Friday night. We sit down and waited about 15 minutes before any wait staff would even acknowledge that we were sitting there. We had to flag down the person who sat us to find our waitress. Waited another 10 minutes for her to bring our water, yet our bar made drinks were ready before the water. Whatever. After that, we ordered. I ordered the Seafood Overload Mac&Cheese.w"" With a side of Broccolini. Ohhhhhh Myyyyyy Gooddddddd. When I tell you this food, all of it, was amazing. I put the Mac and cheese in my mouth and next thing I know my toes curled up and I was this close to passing out! Soooo goodddddd. The lobster was fried, seasoned to perfection. The broccoli was yummy. Seasoned wonderfully, also made my toes curl slightly. Drinks... I ordered the Sweet Georgia. Buzz achieved! Overall, a nice place. Nice vibe, excellent music, staff friendly, but like I said just be ready to wait a bit for your waitress."
4 star rating,Unreal. The food is simply amazing and cooked fresh to order with such friendly staff!
5 star rating,I must say that my wife and I just love this place the food and service was phenomenal
3 star rating,"The food was amazing! I had the Seafood overload mac and cheese and the Culture wings and the portion size was big with plenty to take home for later. My sister had the Salmon tower and after tasting her food I'm definitely torn about what to order on my next visit. The crossiants were to die for and a different twist from the ordinary dinner roll! The atmosphere was warm and inviting, with a hip vibe! The service could use some work our waitresses never provided drink menus after being asked at least twice, she also didn't seem very familiar with the food on the menu and couldn't really provide suggestions, and kept forgetting our food for others in my party, which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that the experience was great and I'll definitely recommend and come back."
4 star rating,no one ever answers the phone its impossible to make or cancel a Registration there phone never gets pick up they should hire a phone person only
1 star rating,"Our date night at Le Culture Cafe was awesome!!! Service was A1 and the food was EXCELLENT, EXCEPTIONAL & EXTRAORDINARY in both taste and presentation which is extremely important because we eat with our eyes FIRST!  I had the stuffed salmon which was perfectly seasoned and my hubby had the Mamba pasta which was delicious!  The special appetizer wings are a MUST...the are LIT literally!  They definitely made return customers out of my hubby and I!"
5 star rating,"the service here was great and the food came out at a perfect time. the only complaint I had was the drinks had no refills, for the price of things on the menu I believe that they should. but I give it for stars because the food and service"
4 star rating,"My husband and I decided to try Leculture for lunch on our 17th  wedding anniversary.  We heard so many good things about the restaurant and wanted to try it.  When we arrived we were told to hurry up and order because kitchen staff was leaving( our reservation was at 1:45pm).  We waited an hour and twenty minutes for our food, it was bland and not as advertised.  Menu stated 6 tiger shrimp with the shrimp and grits entree, it came out with 4 regular shrimp.  When asked about this, we were told they ran out of shrimp and they will discount the meal $5.  Lobster macaroni and cheese was bland and dry.  Ordered drink and was told they were out of watermelon vodka.  Substituted for pineapple vodka and the drink was $13 in a small shooter glass.  Prices are extremely high for what you get.  We asked to speak to a manager was told they were all gone.  Waiter was really nice.  Will not be back."
1 star rating,"Get it together LeCulture or this place will not last long!!!Atmosphere: The atmosphere was nice and clean. Service: IT TAKES TOO LONG! I understand that this place is fairly new, but the system they're running here is not efficient nor effective. This place is small, yet the waitstaff is everywhere. I wasn't sure who my waiter(ess) would be, I had one person bringing me water, another bringing me croissants, and another taking my order. Have you guys ever considered assigning sections to your waitstaff? I noticed an irritated couple to the right of me. They were there before us and it took forever for them to get their food. Their waitress didn't communicate with them on eta of their food, she just continued to give them bread and water. I think it would be nice to educate your staff on alcoholic beverages, at least the basics. I ordered a Remy with a splash of sour and my waiter came back with a tequila sunrise. Food: We ordered the crab cakes (Good), LeCulture wings (Good), and Salmon Tower (Mehh). The salmon tower had the potential if executed properly; Salmon was dry, crab was dry and chewy, and the mash tasted like boxed mash potatoes. Conclusion: I wanted to love this place and I definitely wanted to support our ppl, but this place needs some work! For the price of the food here, the service and quality have to match! I suggest they start reading the feedback that everyone is giving and make the changes, or this place won't last long!"
3.5 star rating,"Food was over seasoned, wait staff was less than courteous. Would not make a return trip even though I drove over an hour to get here!"
1 star rating,Great food! Breakfast and Dinner. Seafood omelet was amazing. Great vibe. Sascha is great.
5 star rating,"If it wasnt for the waitress this place would have gotten 5 stars. The food was prepared in a timely matter and was good. Waitress...not so good. She had dirt in her fingernails, asked her for lemons 3 times, got my husband's order wrong, had to ask for more water and did not clear our table not once while we were there. Waitress could have made this a much more pleasant place to dine."
3 star rating,"First time at LeCulture Cafe.  My daughter made reservations to celebrate Mother's Day. We did not have to wait long for our food. I ordered the lamp chops which were pretty good, but not as hot as they could have been and mashed potatoes. My mashed potatoes did not come until after I was done with the lamb chops. My son had the steak and mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was piping hot. I ate most of his mac n cheese since I did not get my mashes potatoes until we were done eating. The steak was pretty big, but seemed to have more fatty areas than meat. My daughter had the wings. They were so small you could barely see them for $12. We did not have bad customer service, but I guess I expected more in terms of the food for the prices that they charge."
3 star rating,"I've waited months to try this place and disappointed would be an understatement. I ordered the smacking wings and the chicken mamba pasta and they were both terrible. The chicken sauce or ""smackin sauce"", was way too salty, and the pasta had no flavor whatsoever. The chicken was tough and chewy. For the price and quality I could've cooked at home."
2 star rating,"We had a reservation for 9 pm, we were 13 minutes late and the hostess told me it would be a minute because they only give you a 15 minute grace period.  Two other couples comes in shortly after with a 9:30 reservation and they were also told it would be a minute because they took walkins.  Thirty minutes later we were finally seated, the other couples were seated 45 minutes later.  Why take reservations if you're not going to honor them?  Although our waitress was very nice, the service was extremely slow.  We ordered chicken quesadilla's and wings for appetizers, quesadilla was bland and the wings were good.  For dinner I ordered the lobster mac and cheese topped with a fried lobster tail and my husband ordered the 68.00 Oscar Dela Steak (I think thats the name). It took 45 minutes to get our food.  My lobster mac and cheese was dry and the lobster tail was tough.  My husband's steak was tough and crab meat was old and flavorless.  The drinks were small and expensive but very good.  I was disappointed because I'd seen them on Live in the D and on Facebook and the food looked so yummy.  2.5 stars for me"
3 star rating,"This was honestly some of the best food I have experienced at a restaurant in quit sometime. The staff was prompt and the food was piping hit. I though my drink wasn't that strong until I stood up, needless to say great experience. I will definitely be returning"
5 star rating,"First time, went for brunch. We were greeted and seated immediately. I had the breakfast special, the only thing I didn't care for was the sausage. It was like sliders for a burger, no real flavor seeing as they were supposed to be spicy. I will try again for dinner"
4 star rating,The restaurant is cute and has lots of potential. There are just some improvements needed. Enter the restaurant no one greeted me. The website states they serve liquor but we were notified that on Sunday's they don't serve liquor. This was very disappointing. We ordered our food. I ordered the seafood overload Mac and cheese. It was okay lacked seasoning and the lobster tail was fried in corn meal (not a fan). The staff lacked enthusiasm which impacted the dinning experience. I ordered a carry out order of salmon burger and fries which was awesome. Overall the restaurant has potential but they need to work on the servers and serving alcohol  on Sundays.
3 star rating,Had the breakfast.  Food was great.  Service was a little ehhh.  Food makes up for it tho
3.5 star rating,"First time visiting this place, it was my sons 15th birthday!   We had reservations for 8 people we did have to wait for like an additional 15mins in a designated waiting area. The Host was super nice and very welcoming. We ordered our food it was delicious everyone liked their food no complaints. We got some bomb.com honey butter crescent rolls. Our waiter Jamin was very patient and nice the entire evening and kept us updated on food that was still being brought out. He checked on us periodically making sure our party was satisfied and had a good time. Very intimate and homely feel to restaurant environment. Kinda pricey menu but in my opinion well worth it. I'll be revisiting soon."
5 star rating,"Everything was delish, was seated upon arrival.  Only critique I can give is that the owner needs to contact the city of Detroit regarding the signs that are related to parking and paying meters. It's a set up for tickets to be given...as there is a meter but also a sign stating no standing...parking enforcement was out strong. No one wants to go to an establishment that they've waited on a reservation for and get a $45 ticket while spending good money to eat."
5 star rating,"This place soothes my soul!!! When I tell you EVERY-THING on this menu is bangin'....BOOOOYYYY!The vibes, music, people...from the starters to the dessert all good! Bring an appetite! Better yet, order your meals and immediately ask for a carry out container so that you can put half of your food away to make room for dessert! Share with your date/friends and taste everything. Love this place! Take your time, talk, eat and enjoy Lê Culture! #ForThePeople"
5 star rating,"I was excited to support this black owned business and was truly disappointed after waiting 2 months for reservations.  Everything was super expensive, which I don't mind if the food is worth it.  The food prices don't match the overall restaurant ambiance of a mom & pops hole in the wall restaurant.  There's obvious needed repairs of the ceiling.  I had lamb chops that had good flavor but over cooked and tough.  I ordered them medium well.  I also ordered a lobster tail on the side for $18 and it was way overcooked.  My date had fried lobster and it too was overcooked and rubbery.  The $12 wing ding appetizer was good, but they were just that....wing dings.  Overall, the service was good, the food was seasoned good but overcooked.  I will go back if someone else pays for my meal!  I'm sure the food isn't always overcooked, they had the wrong chef on 6-1-19 at 9:15 pm.  If this restaurant doesn't provide the ambiance and food to match the food prices and long reservation list, they won't be in business long."
2 star rating,"Terrible first experience there. Long wait (two hours), took forever to bring the food out and the manager (female with honey blonde hair) rude as hell and terrible management skills. food was pretty good, however the service needs a lot of work. BTW they add 20% tip to your bill for a table of 5+ so pay attention to that lol. Even though the food was good, I expected for there to be good service as well because when go out you're paying for the service too right??? Anyway, let's get to the nitty gritty, got my food as well as everyone else at the table and they totally forgot my mother's meal. Spoke with the server twice and every time he said her food should be out shortly. After everyone was finished with their meal and ready for the check ""MY MOTHER STILL DID NOT GET HER FOOD!!"" Spoke with the manager, expressed my concern/frustration, suggested that the meal be comped at pointe and she did not want to compensate for my mothers meal for negligence on their end in the kitchen. Needless to say, she refuse to comp the meal, which was bizarre to me....anyway definitely won't be going back to this restaurant nor will anyone else that was in our party. You all just lost 6 new customers over a damn fish sandwich‍"
1 star rating,"We had reservations at 11. We were sat at 11:07. We advised the ""manager"" we didn't see at waitress at 11:23. She came at 11:30. It was 3 of us. We asked for water and line for the table. She brought 2. 10 mins later she came back and asked for drink orders. We ordered 2 orders of bottomless mimosas. The waitress told us she couldn't ""spilt"" the bottomless mimosas. We advised that we ordered 2 , and we can afford 2 smh. 15 mins later she asked ""are you ready"" we didn't know what for...so we asked ""to order"" she shook her head yes. So we order food, but still never go the mimosas. 10 mins later. Mimosas. 45 mins later a chef comes out and tells us ""one of chefs need to get slapped"" and our food was coming. We looked around. A couple who was sat 45 mins after us was eating. The ""manager"" advised.... ""we will not comp the bill""... so we left hungry after 2 hours ... did i mention bottomless mimosas means 4 mimosas... and we don't know our waitress' name.. she never told us"
1 star rating,"After seeing the post on social media my friend decided to make us reservations for 11am. We arrived on time and were seated with no hesitation. We waited 15 mins and we had to advise the manager that we didn't have a server. After our server came we order the ""bottomless"" mimosas which aren't bottomless because they have a limit of 4. We placed our orders and let's just say we left at 12:45 and still hadn't received our food. We kept getting continuous excuses about how the kitchen was back up yet tables that came in after us had received their orders. I really wanted to give this place a shot but it was definitely a let down."
1 star rating,"Was extremely excited to check out Le Culture Cafe on a trip to Detroit with an investor colleague of mine who are contributing in many ways to one of my favorite cities (Detroit vs everybody) We strolled into Le Culture Culture Cafe around 9 Pm on Saturday night. No reservation, which I lived in Chicago for 10 years and Los angeles for the past 3 years, I have waited 2 hours for a table at restaurants I wanted to eat at and would gladly do it again. I was prepared to do so at Le Culture Cafe. Before I could warmly approach the host, She shouted to me ""We are booked!"" Before I could even tell her whether I had a reservation or was meeting another party. I told her kindly that I would like to put my name in. No. I asked if there was a bar. ""it's full."" I asked If i may wait for a cancellation or possible opening since there was just two of us. No. I asked if I could make a future reservation. ""go online"" This woman was telling me that I will not be eating there. Everything was an objection and it was incredibly rude and uncomfortable. I understand that Detroit is kind of new to the touristy restaurant scene...but don't let your staff ruin this for you, Le Culture Cafe. We are really trying hard to build up the morale amongst tourism in Detroit, where still has a reputation of being ""mostly boarded up"" and poverty stricken....So to encounter someone who was barking in our face and taking pleasure in it to be a greeter at a restaurant that is getting a decent buzz, is not a good look. Best wishes, but I will not be making another attempt to visit. Tip: Make reservations and have thick skin to rude workers that don't want money.EDIT: Scratch the ""make a reservation"". I've read several other refuse that they discriminate against who they seat. Carry on."
1 star rating,"This is based on our visit at this restaurant in April 2019.  I'm just now getting around to writing this review as I have been off YELP for a little while.  We had reservation and checked in on time.. needless to say we left without eating and waited over 45 minutes to experience the ""Fine Dining"" that everyone is raving about.  Going to this restaurant had to have been one of the most disappointing experiences we have had in a very long time especially downtown.  We waited almost a hour to place our order after we were seated.  We witnessed three tables be seated after us and they each placed their order and received their food.  Although we arrived there before many others were seated some of these tables were placing orders, eating, and receiving their drinks well before we were even acknowledged.  After the female manager noticed we had not been approached by one of the wait staff she came over and ask us had we been helped and if not she would be willing to take care of us from that point.  Because we had become extremely agitated with the entire ordeal we opted not to order any food. We felt it was best we leave.  The manager did cover the cost of our drinks and we then left.I did make mention of this on another social media site and after 2 weeks one of the owners responded with a ""What is it, you are seeking or what do you suggest we do"".  I never responded to his question.  I truly believe he could careless about what transpired that night as he has many happy patrons so one or two disappointed customers here or there mean nothing to them.   I am happy to see others enjoyed their food and their experience.No apologies needed.. !!"
2 star rating,"My experience was awesome! We arrived about 15 minutes early and was seated immediately. Our server Jamin was ""Johnny on the spot"" he was prompt and attentive, even asked us if we were celebrating a birthday or anything so we could be acknowledged. The food was hot, delicious and tastefully displayed. The servings were so large we have food for lunch tomorrow. The dining experience exceeded my expectations, I will be back and I'm going to recommend this restaurant to everyone. Great job!"
3.5 star rating,Where do I start the hostess and the staff was very unprofessional never had a smile on their face wasn't welcoming at all maybe cause it was hot in the restaurant  due to the low quality of air Idk or maybe they just didn't like  working .  It took 20 minutes to get water I ordered mimosas it took another 25 min to get a drink due  to the waitress saying they didn't have enough champagne glasses and we had to wait until the other guest was finished to snag a glass last but not least my food was not up to restaurant standards the potatoes was old my oversized pancake was on a saucers  the experience was very unpleasant. I hope from this review he make some changes with the staff eventually he's going to lose a lot of business due to the operation
2 star rating,"What a disappointment. And I mean truly. My party of 3 arrived at 5:15pm and after it was all said and done, we left the establishment around 8:50pm. Almost 4 hours to receive our food and even waited way too long to get our checks. RIDICULOUS. In the midst of us waiting there were other parties who also voiced their frustrations with their food being cold and waiting long to the manager. We were able to get 25% off the entire meal....but I mean. That didn't give us our time back. Never again. I don't care how good the food is. ‍"
1 star rating,Food is good. They were out of a few things. The waiter was awesome though we had to wait a long time he was very attentive and informative. The atmosphere was very well laid out from music to the decor and seating great job on that. Overall I would give it about a 7 or 8 out of 10.
4 star rating,"Let me first say. I've heard a lot of mixed reviews on lLe Culture. And now let me say, if you had a bad experience. I'm sorry. I had a wonderful experience. The reason being, a lady named Sam. Her service was top tier and that's me being modest. If you eat at Le Culture, ask for Sam. She broke down the menu like it was the only thing she ever studied in her life! Gave me the pros and cons of everything before I took a real look at the menu. Sam = good time at Le Culture. The food was a good plus too. I had the Crab/Lobster cakes and boy. It was a lot of meat, fried so damn nice. It was some good ass corn sprinkled in as well. They brought some CRAZY glazed croissants too. I ain't even know that was in they package. Very fucking impressed. They lamb chops were also. MEATY AF! And if you like Brussel sprouts them was a hitter too. I'm on that salmon tower next. See y'all soon. And I'm reviewing.. again!"
5 star rating,I ordered the crab legs. They were seasoned to perfection. And the macaroni was A1. Drinks were good too. Will definitely go back
5 star rating,"Visiting Detroit for the Auto Show and came across this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised. It is reservation only, but they let us dine. Everybody enjoyed the food and the presentation and service was good. My Salmon was bland and I don't like a lot of seasoning, but this was under par. For the most expensive dish on the menu at $42, it should have been on point."
4 star rating,"Nice venue, nice staff! The wait for the food was ridiculous though.....our reservation was at 9:45, our food didn't come out until 11:00. Other than that, it was nice!"
3 star rating,"Food was good. Cafe is small... We had reservations, were seated quickly, bread and food arrived expeditiously. Service was accommodating and management stopped by our table to make sure that we enjoyed ourselves. I have no complaints. The crab cake appetizer was AMAAAAAZING! We had the seafood Mac and cheese as well as the Mamba Pasta. All delicious. Definitely plan on going back.The setup was more casual than I expected, though not necessarily a bad thing. The parking enforcement was giving out tickets while we ate, so be mindful of that."
4 star rating,"I made an appt to visit LeCulture @ 10:30a on my birthday as my first time to the restaurant.  Don't look for a birthday perk.  They don't give them during lunch...not even a verbal ""HB"" from server when mentioned to her twice.  No biggy.  It was not crowed at all.  I was a bit underwhelmed with the environment since they try to list themselves as somewhat higher end dining.  My table was dirty, the menus given to me had gouda grits all over them I suppose from the guests the day before.  I ordered the seafood omelet with a choice of gouda grits and 1 pancake.  My omelet and gouda grits came out in a reasonable amount a time but soon grew cold as I tried to pace myself to wait for my lonely pancake so, that I could eat all of my choice foods together.  Unfortunately, my pancake came out about 20 minutes later.  The taste of the omelet (reasonable portion) and the music selection (not the flies I watched bouncing around the table and windows next to me) were probably the only elements I enjoyed from my experience.  I would suggest them fine tune some things including fixing the involuntarily swinging front door handle that I thought would come off in my hand.  I was not offered any croissants.  Perhaps, they are only offered during dinner.  I wouldn't say I'll never go back, but I'm in no hurry."
3 star rating,"Not as hyped up as you think. Food wasn't that great and the service wasn't either. A bit over priced if you ask me. $3.5 for a cup of Faygo pop with no refills...rip off! Whoever runs the company social media page should be replaced. By the restaurant being popular they usually only take customers who have reservations. On their social media page they advertised ""Now taking walk-ins"". After arriving we were asked if we had reservations and since we didn't we were asked to sit in the waiting area when clearly there were plenty of staff and tables available. I ordered the chicken quesadilla, which the chicken was really dry, and my sister in law ordered the crab cakes, which was also dry, and did not look like they did on the advertisement. Not to mention all of the food was not brought out together. The fries took so long to come out that we honestly had forgotten about them. On top of the disappointment we were experiencing with the food and service, the gnats hovering over the food became extremely annoying. After hearing and seeing the couple next to us have the same complaints we just assumed that we picked a bad day to come and would try again later. After leaving a comment under a picture that's on their social media page both me and my sister in law were blocked from their page! Instead of handling the situation professionally and reaching out to us to apologize for the bad experience or to even see if they could have made the next experience better, we were blocked. With that being said me nor my family will never visit this establishment again!"
3.5 star rating,"Excellent food. We ordered steak, lobster and chicken dishes. Of course salads and one came with duck bacon and that was good too..Excellent service.  Lisa was our server.Le Culture in the city got it going on!!!!"
5 star rating,Awesome new restaurant in the heart of the city. One of my favorite spots to eat. Will be back soon!
5 star rating,"I booked my reservation on OpenTable a month ago because every date in June was filled. I can see what all the hype is about though. We arrived at 6:45pm for our 7pm slot and were seated promptly. Staff were friendly and very busy. We received waters right away to cool off in this heat. There was no bar menu, but we were told there was one on Instagram. I was disappointed to see no free refills on soft drinks. At about $3.50 a glass, it seems very steep for not even one refill. We put our orders in at around 7:05 and received our food around 7:20. I was impressed. I didn't experience any of the horrible wait times other reviewers had. We ordered the catfish po'boy, salmon tower with a side of creamed corn, and seafood overload mac and cheese. The food was very tasty. Everything was cooked to perfection. Nothing was dry or bland. I was expecting a little more seafood in my mac and cheese though. I got a fried lobster tail on top and didn't get much else. It can get a little crowded in the restaurant, but then again all the restaurants near Eastern Market are tiny. All in all, I'd say we had a good time. I'd go again."
4 star rating,"Nikki was amazing!!! We were sitting at our table waiting on our waiter, Nikki walked passed asked have we been helped and immediately took our order. She was knowledgeable about the menu, sweet and very attentive even with it being extremely busy. When we got our food everything was perfect!!!! I will definitely come back everyone at our table enjoyed themselves."
5 star rating,"I was so excited, I waited 3 weeks to get a table. Our service was slow.  Not necessarily a place for great cocktails. Our server seemed preoccupied and her follow-up was extremely slow. We asked for recommendations for a signature drink, none to offer, we asked for highlights of the menu, statement-""everything is good"".  Aside from the slow service my food was ok- prices were reasonable. I had the overloaded seafood Mac with a fried rock lobster tail. My lobster tail was chewy, but the pieces of crab in the Mac was extremely tender and flavorful. The Mac it self was just ok. My guy had the lamb chops he was very pleased. The waitress did inform us the Lamb chops require a 30-35 minute wait for cook time. I can honestly say my expectations were mismanaged."
3 star rating,"I went to le culture today for brunch with a few friends and my son, we walked in and were seated right away. Since this was all of our first time there we literally ordered like 2 meals each. Everything sounded so good we just couldn't decide. Everything tasted as good as it looked, delicious! The banana French toast was amazing. We literally couldn't stop eating. We also had their mimosas which came in a few different flavors. The staff was great as well, very friendly! They brought out a bowl of grits for my baby while we were waiting on our order..I would definitely recommend this place. Good vibes and amazing food!"
5 star rating,"Fantastic food, great customer service and a beautiful  venue! The Bone in steak, lobster mac and cheese, and lamb chops to die for. A must try spot!"
5 star rating,"so far, so good.  Always good food and a friendly staff.  Things do happen for a reason, browsing looking for something to do after dinner for Valentine's day and discovered the couples event that included 4 course meal , drinks and Jazz.  Boom I just found something . . .A little mix up with reservations and menu etc. in new location with events. However with the helpful and nice staff that go over and above to get whatever is needed you still get 5 stars.  This place is awesome in my book and I love, love, love the seafood meals served.  Yes they have steak and chicken and other yummy items on the menu but I am there for the seafood.  All I can say is keep up the good work and I will recommend you to anyone on any day of the week."
5 star rating,What a disappointment. I had hoped that this place would be a bit better than my intuition suggested and certainly not as bad as I could imagine... well. The food is just awful. The pasta dish allegedly came with chicken.... not that I could see but I guess that why for $8 you could ADD chicken. My usual Friday date dinner is usually $250-300 for two but even in my experience $8 for add on chicken was a bit stiff in this city. That aside the pasta dish was like some kind of noodle soup. The sauce could be sucked through a straw! Ugh. Messy and impossible to navigate with a fork but that's what they gave us with the paper napkins. My martini was cheap but you have to give step by step instructions if you want a real drink and not well liquor with some kind of sweet mix. I can stay home to make my own cocktails. The crab/lobster cake was your standard cake with too much breading but you can see the lobster claw meat. The best part was the brussel sprouts. Nothing special but at least they weren't bad. The service was horrible. The seating is cramped and when a woman was seated on a stool at eye level with our heads at our lower table let's just say that wasn't the rear view i was paying for. The waiter was unsure but well intentioned. Attention was lacking. Service was slow and the smoke from the kitchen was an eye burner only improved by opening the front door and letting all the night light loving bugs in. They seemed to enjoy my pasta dish ‍. Everything ain't for everybody so if you've been to great or even good spots especially spots with good service in other places (I live in NYC part time) skip this overrated spot.  You'll be sorely disappointed.
1 star rating,Made a reservation for a certain time didn't get seated until an hour and 15 mins after our reservation time. Did not receive our food for another 45 mins. Gnats were everywhere. Saw our waitress maybe twice had to ask other people for help. I would not come back. It was amazing the first time I went but the second time was a disaster!
3.5 star rating,"I went here with my friends after the Gucci mane concert on Saturday and had a terrible experience. We waited almost 2 hours for our food. Then my girls pepsi was flat and warm. When we were talking to the light skinned manager (can't remember her name) she was very rude, had a smart mouth and sarcastic. We were being very nice to her but when we told her my girls pop was flat, instead of offering to bring us another pop she offered to bring us some more ice. And then when we wanted to change our food order (thinking we would our food faster) they were out of half of the things on the menu. They didn't even have the whipped potatoes that came with my stuffed salmon. After we hit the 2 hour mark for our food we just got up and left. I really love to support local businesses but this was the first and last time I'll be visiting. We wouldn't have left if they had what we ordered or if the customer service was better. Just a bad experience all around. I tried contacting them via their Instagram page and no response, not even an apology. Pathetic."
1 star rating,"My first time eating here was last Friday. My date ordered the Lobster Mac and said it was perfect. I however, ordered the bone-in Ribeye- Medium well. The first time it was brought out, it was cooked perfectly. However, the cut was NOT a bone-in Ribeye. It looked to be more of a porterhouse. The sauce, I thought, was overwhelmingly salty. I sent it back and asked for the sauce to be placed on the side. It took nearly 30 minutes to get a replacement. And when it finally came, it was well done and more salty than the original. Aside from my steak and the time it took, which I just asked that it be removed from the bill and didn't take anything- the staff was incredibly unwelcoming. Everyone that made eye contact seemed to want to get into a staring match. No smiles. No hello. Nothing. Only the manager upon entering and our server the first time she came to the table. I may give it a second shot, only because I was so hopeful"
2 star rating,Visited here for my sister's birthday celebration. My new favorite restaurant! Had the salmon tower and it was absolutely delicious! Also sampled the seafood overload Mac & cheese and culture wings. Best Mac and cheese I ever had! Wings were great too!  Our waiter Byron was awesome! Very friendly and ensured that our bills will split appropriately being that we had a large party. He also brought the chef out as requested so that we could thank him. Wasn't too thrilled about our seating location. It was right next to the door which brought in a chill every time someone entered or exited the building. Bathroom was also unisex/single stall but was clean. I'm sure in due time a new and larger location will be purchased.  With the food being that awesome expansion is definitely needed. Will be returning soon!
5 star rating,"By far the best restaurant around, hands down. Intimate, cozy, excellent service, great ppl, great comfort food and GREAT MUSIC MONDAYS!DETROIT STRUCK GOLD!...A DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH!!!"
5 star rating,"My friends and I visited Le Culture and was extremely impressed with the food and quality. Our server was Ms. Sam and she had an amazing personality and was very attentive. She helped each of us pick and decide on what to eat, which was a difficult task with such a large indecisive group. I ended up choosing the lamb chops and mac and cheese. The lamb chops were the best I ever tasted, not only were they cooked perfectly but the flavor of the sauce was incredible."
5 star rating,Food is ok. A little overpriced. Service was average when I went.
3 star rating,"We really enjoyed our experience at LeCulture Cafe. They have nice R&B music playing, and the atmosphere is urban chic but intimate. Upon arrival we were seated right away. Our server was promoted and very friendly. The food was excellent, and plentiful. You will need a take out box if you don't have a big appetite. We had the Le Ceasar salads, Salmon Tower, Lamb Chops, and Truffle Fries. We will definitely be back."
5 star rating,"Was extremely excited to check out Le Culture Cafe on a trip to Detroit with an investor colleague of mine who are contributing in many ways to one of my favorite cities (Detroit vs everybody) We strolled into Le Culture Culture Cafe around 9 Pm on Saturday night. No reservation, which I lived in Chicago for 10 years and Los angeles for the past 3 years, I have waited 2 hours for a table at restaurants I wanted to eat at and would gladly do it again. I was prepared to do so at Le Culture Cafe. Before I could warmly approach the host, She shouted to me ""We are booked!"" Before I could even tell her whether I had a reservation or was meeting another party. I told her kindly that I would like to put my name in. No. I asked if there was a bar. ""it's full."" I asked If i may wait for a cancellation or possible opening since there was just two of us. No. I asked if I could make a future reservation. ""go online"" This woman was telling me that I will not be eating there. Everything was an objection and it was incredibly rude and uncomfortable. I understand that Detroit is kind of new to the touristy restaurant scene...but don't let your staff ruin this for you, Le Culture Cafe. We are really trying hard to build up the morale amongst tourism in Detroit, where still has a reputation of being ""mostly boarded up"" and poverty stricken....So to encounter someone who was barking in our face and taking pleasure in it to be a greeter at a restaurant that is getting a decent buzz, is not a good look. Best wishes, but I will not be making another attempt to visit. Tip: Make reservations and have thick skin to rude workers that don't want money.EDIT: Scratch the ""make a reservation"". I've read several other refuse that they discriminate against who they seat. Carry on."
1 star rating,Food is amazing! Slow service but that's only because they are new and they are packed... well worth the wait! I'll be returning next time I'm in town!
5 star rating,"Well, I've been here 3 times, and only the first time was a pleasant experience. Food is good, but service is terrible. 2nd time I came and waited about 10-15 minutes before someone came to table (first strike). Waitress finally comes over, and no apology for the wait (second strike). We decided that we were just getting appetizers since the service started bad and we go somewhere else for dinner. I asked for the chicken wings, without the sauce (I have peanut allergy) they bring out chicken wings with sauce on them after I made it clear I have peanut allergy. (Third strike). Came here a few weeks ago because the girls wanted to come. I tried to warn them, but just like I thought it would be crappy again. We waited again a long time for water and one of friends ask why it's taking so long. So I we ordered appetizers and had one drink and left. They really need to get someone that knows how manage a restaurant front of the house. This place will never be a fine dining restaurant with that type of service. What makes those places fine dining is the service, atmosphere, and"

3.5 star rating,"I'll start out by saying that the food here is absolutely amazing! I had the salmon tower, which was topped with shrimp and crab meat in a creamy sauce, it was paired with mash && spinach. For dessert I had the black bottom cheesecake, which was delicious. It's a nice small cozy place. It's reservations only, which kind of sucks because they're always booked. So you literally have to plan ahead. When I arrived I was greeted by the hostess, whom was very nice. I was seated immediately && the waiter came within seconds with water. The staff is very friendly. Had no complaints."
4 star rating,"Leculture cafe is a cozy restaurant with friendly  young staff .. The food was excellent, the wait time ran a little long but well worth it. Pleasant surprise after dinner chocolate strawberries very good . Lamb chops with lobster macaroni a must will return."
4 star rating,"Went here for a friends birthday and the service provided to us by our waitress Shay was wonderful. Food had great flavor, our table had the mamba chicken pasta, the lamb chops, seafood Mac and the salmon tower. Our reservations time was 10p so by the time we ordered the kitchen and bar was closing. My suggestion would be that the bar remains open until all patrons have left because some of our table wanted to order another round of drinks. My biggest problem of the night was my order of lamb chops were ordered medium well and when I received them they were beyond that point and where at well done which left them dry. When the waitstaff went back to the kitchen and came back out the kitchen stated that the lamb chops were medium well. Now I have been to many restaurants and I consider myself to be a foodie. By all means were the results of my lamb well done and over cooked. The lamb was tough and I was left without lamb chops because the kitchen wouldn't remake them because they had already cut off the burners. All of this is according to the kitchen. Not one time did the chef or cook staff come out to our table but yet relayed the message through the waitress. I was highly disappointed and felt that the kitchen obviously didn't care. Not to mention as my table were gathering our items to leave, the kitchen staff which I believe to be the cook, stated which one had the problem with the lamb chops, speaking to a different employee. Not once did he approach our table but this is what I heard. As much as I dine out, I know the difference between rare, medium, medium well and well done. It's just wrong that the kitchen cook didn't know how to properly cook medium well. There was absolutely no slight pink at all. Just completely well done. Everything was delicious. Tip to all who order the lamb chops order them medium so they get it right and your lamb well be edible."
3 star rating,"Get it together LeCulture or this place will not last long!!!Atmosphere: The atmosphere was nice and clean. Service: IT TAKES TOO LONG! I understand that this place is fairly new, but the system they're running here is not efficient nor effective. This place is small, yet the waitstaff is everywhere. I wasn't sure who my waiter(ess) would be, I had one person bringing me water, another bringing me croissants, and another taking my order. Have you guys ever considered assigning sections to your waitstaff? I noticed an irritated couple to the right of me. They were there before us and it took forever for them to get their food. Their waitress didn't communicate with them on eta of their food, she just continued to give them bread and water. I think it would be nice to educate your staff on alcoholic beverages, at least the basics. I ordered a Remy with a splash of sour and my waiter came back with a tequila sunrise. Food: We ordered the crab cakes (Good), LeCulture wings (Good), and Salmon Tower (Mehh). The salmon tower had the potential if executed properly; Salmon was dry, crab was dry and chewy, and the mash tasted like boxed mash potatoes. Conclusion: I wanted to love this place and I definitely wanted to support our ppl, but this place needs some work! For the price of the food here, the service and quality have to match! I suggest they start reading the feedback that everyone is giving and make the changes, or this place won't last long!"
2 star rating,"I checked out the restaurant last night for the first time. Honestly from the picks online and the reviews, I had mixed feelings, and was scared it might be to good to be true. I was definitely not disappointed. Walking in, the lighting, ambiance, music was very laid back and comfortable. The staff was very easy going and casually welcoming, while still being professional and attentive. Unfortunately, we didnt reserve a table, so we had to sit at the bar, but it worked out because the bartender Nicki was super nice and friendly. She immediately asked if we wanted drinks, and helped us with the menu by answering any questions and offering recommendations. Our food came out in about 7 mins, I mean it was the fastest service that I have EVER had at a restaurant!! The food was hot, flavorful, presentation was nice and again although things were super fast and chill, the food and service didn't come off as rushed. Looking forward to going back!"
5 star rating,"I've been following the owner on Instagram for a while and his food always looked amazing so I had to stop in.Reservations: I made reservations a month in advance and was easily accommodated. They was no wait for my sisters and I.Atmosphere: I expected more grand entry. It was chill and laid back. Drinks: Patron margarita was tasty.Food: appetizer: chicken was really good but only came with flat pieces. The bread was buttery with syrup. The lamb chops were overall price. I would've liked if it came 4 for 32 instead of 3. The fries were decent. Salmon burger was salty. I ordered the salmon tower. It came with spinach, mashed potatoes and one side. I ordered the Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese was good. The salmon had a lot of food. The parking was difficult. There's many ways to get a ticket on that street so I parked in the rear. It's overhyped. Overly expensive because the atmosphere doesn't match the price. The service is attentive just wish there was a bigger menu."
4 star rating,"First time being here.. the space in Downtown Detroit, small and elegant, not in a location you would think, you could possibly drive pass it. but hey once you find the spot!!! Nice service, I had a 7:45pm reservation,  it wasn't full to capacity, but if it were, you would be cramp, so keep that in mind, trying to entertain a large group would be annoying, but the food was delicious, I had the salmon tower.... it was worth the price ( get a side of bread)..it's a worth trying!! It's nice casual dress place, you can get fancy if you want!! I definitely would go back"
4 star rating,"Good food is not enough. The experience starts at the door. We had a 4PM reservation which apparently is when the restuarant opens. We arrived at 3:55PM and were asked to wait outside in subfreezing temperatures along with two other patrons. One of which was a senior on a walker! A bit of advice, if you begin seating at 4PM your doors should open at least by 3:30PM. Furthermore, your patrons should never have to wait outside in the cold because your staff is not ready at 3:55.Once we were allowed in and seated a whole other experience began. The tables are too close together. Multiple times I was bumped by other patrons and wait staff moving about the dining area. A couple of times while eating, I experienced the waitresses rear end in my personal space while she was serving the tables next to us. That's always a negative for me. As well as the lack of attention our waitress provided us considering how small the space is and the number of tables she was serving.  The hostess talking on her cell phone was also a disappointment considering the lact of attention we received during our visit.The food had really good flavor. The only downside was that the meat we ordered was not cooked to the temperature we requested. In comparison to another recent fine dining experience I had the price points were the same, but the level of service I received elsewhere far exceeded what I experienced at LeCulture cafe.  There is a great opportunity for improvement. If I had been awed by my experience I would not hesitate to spend another $150 on a meal here again really soon. That being said, hopefully this feedback falls on receiving ears and improvements are made before my next visit."
2 star rating,First time eating here. Service was good. Atmosphere was pleasant. Had an issue with my lamb chops and I didn't want to send them back but the waitress insisted so I did. I like how she had too make it right. Sides are large enough to share. The only negative I have is that I wished the menu was explained some. The ribeye comes with mashed potatoes so don't order French fries. The wings come out flaming and looked delicious.
4 star rating,"We had 715 reservations on a Saturday night arrived about 10 minutes late and were still seated immediately. We ordered the crab cakes appetizer, fried king crab legs, the culture bag, mashed potatoes and broccolini. Everything was great. The food did not take long to come out at all as I was expecting a long wait based on reviews. Our sever was great. Some of the food we ordered isnt on the menu but is featured on their social media page. My only recommendation would to dim the lights a little since its supposed to be fine dining restaurant and to put a podium in the reception area so customers aren't confused when walking in. I think this restaurant is off to a great start."
3.5 star rating,"Never again. Our reservation was for 8:45. We were seated maybe 15 minutes later and once we were seated we waited at least another 15 minutes before I had to get up and ask for a waiter. They even took 15 more minutes to bring us water. By 10:20 I asked how much longer it would be for our food and we were told they didn't know. The woman next to us had been there since 8:00 and still did not have her meal. The people across from us received their meat and the waiters came out with their sides 35 minutes later. It was a total disaster. We ended up leaving by 10:30, hungry and without food. Waste of time!"
1 star rating,"Today is my first time coming here. I'm still here actually. I had a 4pm reservation, waited 2 hours for Brussels Sprouts and when the bowl came out it wasn't even a half bowl. I asked about the portion amount before I ordered. The cook/waiter was very rude when I asked him about my food. Told me that the kitchen was swamped and rudely walked away. The waitress was nice, she did what she could to make it right, yet in her power she could only do so much being the fact that there was no manager, SMH. BTW I was told that I wasn't being charged for the strawberry lemonade that was given to me in the first place due to my first sip of water had some unknown particle in it. I'm still leaving hungry and very disappointed and dissatisfied."

3 star rating,My sister-in-law and I decided on this place for a girls night out. The food wasn't good and over sauced. The lobster mac&cheese was over cooked. I only like the fries and my sister-in-law loved the chicken wings. I'm a foodie so I purchase everything on the menu and only like the fries (that says a lot).
1 star rating,"I was very disappointed after eating there. My girlfriend and I have been wanting to try it out for a while. First off I thought the staff was excellent. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. My problem is with the food. That was probably the worst steak I've ever gotten from a restaurant and it cost 42$. Over cooked and tough.  (I ordered it medium)  The Mac and Cheese is pretty bland as well, which surprised me because it looked like it was gonna be good. Everything else was just ok. But my girlfriend did like her lamb chops, so I'll give them that. Nice place but the food is way overpriced and not that good. To many better options in the city for that kinda money."
2 star rating,"I waited to write this review as this is my second time trying them. First time was a disaster with service and although the food was great impacted my whole experience. I make a reservation for 2 weeks later. Walk in restaurant not as chaotic as the first time and this time we sit in I believe is the main dining room. Waitress was really nice and I am mad I didn't get her name but was very friendly. I told her about our last experience and although we were never compensated the first time I thought she'd feel empowered to buy us an appetizer, she doesn't no big deal. We order appetizers and drinks. Now they just got their liquor license but no drink menu I suggest making one fast. It's nice to know what you have or feature especially if you are wanting to have the feel of fine dining. Appetizers come and looks and taste great. I give the food a 5!! We order our meals, I love that they have large portions and the price point is just right. The server was attentive including anyone that stopped at the table well that is until we are wrapping up our dinner and are told your reservation is only for an hour and a half and we need this table for the next reservation. Mind you at the time of booking no where does it state this. The woman not our waiter insisted that it does. She went on open table to show me and well it didn't tell her either. She continued to insist that it does tell you I told her it doesn't matter we already got up and are leaving. Honestly I would have rated it 4 stars but that lasting impression was unacceptable. I've never been to a restaurant that tells you there is a time limit on your reservation. I want to love this place but I'm not sure if I'll be back. Maybe order Togo."
2 star rating,"My first experience at Le Culture Cafe was not good at all. The waitress was the best, but hostess was not friendly and seemed to be angry. The steak was good and the mac/cheese with crab/lobster was horrible."
2 star rating,Let me start by saying the scenery is very nice and the presentation of the food is amazing! I was with a party of 4 and they couldn't pull up my reservation for some reason but we were seated after a 30 min wait! I ordered the ribeye steak it is a nice size but comes with a sweet glazed on top just in case you didn't know. The lamb chop at our table was good I added an additional lobster tail for $18 steamed it was cold! The salmon tower looks amazing and taste great but it took 1 hour and 20 min to get it because a mix up in the kitchen but the waiter was very apologetic. Right now the appetizer menu has 2 items which sucks a little bit the wings are very tasty though! I'm willing to give them another try since they are new and working out the kinks but over all it was ok!
3 star rating,"I vistited this restaurant for the first time today. The lovster on the macaroni should be a standalone dish. It was good and seasoned well. I also tried the lamb chops whixh was bigger/thicker than what an average restaurant would give  for a hogher price, so kudos for that. The chicken pasta was spicy but plentiful."
4 star rating,"Everything was delish, was seated upon arrival.  Only critique I can give is that the owner needs to contact the city of Detroit regarding the signs that are related to parking and paying meters. It's a set up for tickets to be given...as there is a meter but also a sign stating no standing...parking enforcement was out strong. No one wants to go to an establishment that they've waited on a reservation for and get a $45 ticket while spending good money to eat."

2 star rating,The restaurant is cute and has lots of potential. There are just some improvements needed. Enter the restaurant no one greeted me. The website states they serve liquor but we were notified that on Sunday's they don't serve liquor. This was very disappointing. We ordered our food. I ordered the seafood overload Mac and cheese. It was okay lacked seasoning and the lobster tail was fried in corn meal (not a fan). The staff lacked enthusiasm which impacted the dinning experience. I ordered a carry out order of salmon burger and fries which was awesome. Overall the restaurant has potential but they need to work on the servers and serving alcohol  on Sundays.
3 star rating,"Food was great, we tried 5 different dishes no complaints.. however there was an issue about our reservation they couldn't find it and we had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated host was kind of rude. The waiter and owner were polite and apologized for the inconvenience, will try again they out different dishes so the menu changes every so often"

5 star rating,"As promised, I returned to give this restaurant a second opportunity and they did not disappoint. I had the pleasure of being served by Moe again. He was as hospitable as he was the prior visit. We had the Culture Wings again as our starter as they were really good our initial visit. This time I ordered the Lobster Mambo Pasta adding Shrimp. My friend has the Chicken Mambo Pasta adding Shrimp. Since our last visit the restaurant has obtained their liquor license so we were able to indulge. I had the Pineapple Long Island and she had the Strawberry Marquerita. Everything was excellent. Service started off a bit shaky as no one initially came over to assist us as far as providing menus and or water. Once Moe saw us and came over to acknowledge us, the young lady assigned to the section told him he ""could have our table"".  There wasn't a need that wasn't addressed after he began. Food order went in expeditiously and was brought out properly heated and very delicious. The owner was gracious enough to come over and talk with us having heard of the prior experience. His passion with his business and food is evident. I will continue to support him and all his future endeavors."
5 star rating,"I have highly anticipated the opening of this restaurant for months so I was super excited to finally make it here. We arrived in the area earlier than our reservation time set for 9PM. I went inside to see if we could get in early. I spoke with who I now know to be the manager who indicated we could. She placed menus at the tabletop for us as we went to park. We came in and seated ourselves. The two young ladies serving never acknowledged or addressed us as they served others on the main side of the restaurant. After at least 30 minutes (thank goodness for great company and conversation) we realized we hadn't yet ordered or received any water. One of the young ladies just then walked over with water and stated Moe would be our server. He came over and quickly recovered, apologizing as he thought that we were taken care of by those actually serving on that side. He was very knowledgeable of the menu and offered recommendations for our starter of the Culture Wings. We elected to go with those. My friend ordered the Bone In Ribeye with mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese. I had the Chicken Mambo Pasta adding Shrimp to it. Another 30 or so minutes goes by, no additional service. We then are told of an issue with the kitchen and our food order was in. We were offered complimentary dessert and beverages plus 25% off the bill. Eventually our entrees arrive and we mention that the appetizer had not come out. We asked them to be taken off at this point. Moe stated that the order was in for them and he'd bring them out on the house. We say fine. My friend's steak ordered as medium well was beyond well done. The Mac and cheese looked reheated from days prior. My pasta was lukewarm at best. I opted to send my food back to be warmed. My friend tried to eat her steak. It was not edible after a few bites as it was too tough. The Mac and cheese was under seasoned. The wings that came out were good. Moe came by checking in with us and offered carry out containers for our food. My friend opted to tell him about the steak as she declined the box. He stated he'd have the manager to come over. She came over and stated she was taking it off the bill altogether, reiterating the complimentary dessert and the beverages. The bill comes and the wings had been added to the bill which we questioned. The manager comes over and in a condescending tone says she ""overrid"" that. Disenchanted by the entire experience at this point I just wanted to pay and leave so I didn't push the matter further. I really want to give a two star rating for this experience but the professionalism and hospitality of Moe as server was stellar thus the additional star. Given that it's a new establishment and the apparent staffing issues to be worked out, I plan to revisit to see the improvements made and have the experience I know this place can offer."
3 star rating,I heard about Leculture on Instagram and saw pictures of the food and was excited to try the restaurant out. I arrived on time for my reservation and waited about 20 minutes to be seated. The waiter was really nice and checked on us a lot. It took about 15 minutes to get my glass of wine and they only had one type of white wine. Their wine options were limited. It took exactly 1 hour and 17 minutes to receive our food. I don't think I've ever waited that long for my food to arrive. I ordered the mamba pasta and it was good. Because it took so long for my food to arrive I doubt I would go back to Leculture. The food wasn't good enough for me to go back and wait more than an hour again.
2 star rating,My food was excellent and I will be returning! It was for my birthday they complimented me with the black bottom cheesecake. Appetizers was the Leculture Wing's that came on fire! Me and my bestfriend had the entrees Mamba Pasta with Chicken and the Seafood Mac and Cheese with fried lobster tail! My food was seasoned and ho which excites me! Anytime I have to wait for my food to cool off and salivate is a GOOD SIGN! Period! Thanks for the experience! Keep the same momentum please! Perfect to the Eastern Market vibe

Service was A1 and the food was EXCELLENT, EXCEPTIONAL & EXTRAORDINARY in both taste and presentation which is extremely important because we eat with our eyes FIRST!  I had the stuffed salmon which was perfectly seasoned and my hubby had the Mamba pasta which was delicious!  The special appetizer wings are a MUST...the are LIT literally!  They definitely made return customers out of my hubby and I!"

5 star rating,"Nice, new spot in the Eastern Market area. This is an all around type of venue. Meaning, date night, family dinner, hanging out with friends, it's a go for all of these here. Atmosphere is cool. Dimming the lights a tad bit would step the ambience up by 100%. Food was good, won't review service and food times until I visit again. We came for the soft opening so kinks were still being worked out. Our server had a good listening ear and the chef catered to our specific requests. A must try. Will return."
5 star rating,"I'm here from out of town and i am so impressed! Me and my family chose to get a few different things and share so we could sample multiple items. We ate the Culture Wings, Seafood Overload Mac&Cheese, and the Roasted Root Vegetable salad and it was all AMAZING! The actual venue is so trendy and cute! Staff was friendly. Everything was great! I will be back again!"
