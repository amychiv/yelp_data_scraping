4 star rating,My favourite restaurant! The soul platter and catfish tofu are my jam. There okra stew is fabulous as well. Having been to many a soul food places throughout the States and cooking it myself- this is jabs down my favourite option.
5 star rating,"Lady who brought out food was a bit rude, not saying hello or anything when my date and I said hello and thank you for bringing the food to the car.I've eaten vegan before, but never been a big fan.  I eat vegan when I have to when I'm with others who are vegan.  The food here was good, but not extraordinary.  We ordered the Soul Platter, ""Catfish,"" a side of Collard Greens (the best of all the dishes), and something else my date ordered but I can no longer recall.I was stuck between giving the food a 3.5-4, but decided on giving an overall 3 because of the rude woman."
3 star rating,"This is THE SPOT okayy? Best vegan food I've ever had. They set the bar. The soul food platter is my favorite. The Mac and Cheese will make a non-vegan want to go vegan. Everything about this place just blows me away. 100 stars if I could! And of course, this place is Black owned soooo it is simply phenomenal."
5 star rating,My mother and I enjoyed a lovely lunch on a Thursday afternoon. She ordered the veggie millet burger and I ordered a blt wrap with fried tofu. My mom's meal was really good. She enjoyed it and our waiter told us it was their more popular meal. My blt wrap was really delicious. I felt the tofu was just slightly too salty. But the rest of the wrap was mild in flavor so it wasn't too overwhelming. Yam fries were yummy!!! Probably my favorite thing. The ambience was airy and sunshiny. The service was friendly. The prices were reasonable. I think this is a good lunch spot and I would recommend a friend to check it out.
4 star rating,"I loooove Detroit Vegan Soul. Everything they've ever made me is the best food I've ever had. No joke.I wish I knew how to make that tofu catfish at home, I would have it all the time. And the Mac and cheese. How is it so cheesy without real cheese?!?Seriously, just go get some ASAP. I have some food allergies and they've always been very helpful and informative to me about whether a food is safe to order. I love all their locations."
5 star rating,"I really hate to give bland review because I was sooooo excited to try this place upon visiting Detroit from Houston. I'm not vegan but I eat vegan and vegetarian quite often and I'm always amazed at how many dishes can taste just as good as non-vegan dishes.... but that wasn't the case here. For starters, the water in the bottles at the center of the table are so cute but extremely dirty. We asked our server twice for a new bottle because there were floaties in the bottle and on the glass. After the 3rd dirty bottle, We took a bottle from an empty table and it was still disgustingly dirty. So we ended up not drinking anything which was a huge disappointment. When it came to the food, The plating was bomb but the food itself was mediocre at best. I took an ""instagrammable"" photo of my Soul Food Platter with BBQ Tofu because I told my followers I'd be coming.... what a disappointment. The cornbread was rock solid, the black eyed peas tasted like they were out of a can and salt and pepper couldn't even help, the collard greens could've been great but they were SOOOO salty. I ate some of the bbq tofu and the Mac and cheese which were okay but I was so let down. I didn't update my followers on my experience. We just went to another restaurant afterwards bc instead of leaving with full stomachs and empty plates, we left with full plates and empty stomachs. The servers were kind so of course we tipped well but doubt I'll be returning."
2 star rating,"Great spot! I ordered the soul plater and wow did this dish not disappoint. Mac and Cheese, smoked collards, yams, cornbread, and black eyed peas. This favorite menu item is pretty popular and I can see why. The collard greens were full of flavor and just enough smoke taste to not overbear the collard greens. 100% plant base, organic, and friendly atmosphere make Vegan Soul a must stop if you are in the Detroit area.Keep up the great work Detroit Vegan Soul, see you soon :-)"
4 star rating,"What a great place! Lovely interior, super friendly staff. I love having a full carafe of water on the table (I drink a lot of water and I almost always ""run dry"" before a refill is offered or must be requested). I absolutely LOVE going to a vegan restaurant where I won't have to pick one or two times from a menu that will accommodate my food choice: everything here is vegan I optimistically ordered the Soul Platter with an add-on of ""Catfish"" tofu. And I was not disappointed! From least interesting to most:Sweet potatoes-tender cubes of sweet potato that tasted as if they were sweetened with agave syrup. I don't think sweet potatoes need sweetening, but if you do them southern sweet style, pure maple syrup would be preferable. But they were still pretty goodThe collards were perfectly cooked: tender but still green. Raw red onion chopped on top added a nice crunch and kick. Good-my preference is no sweetness to my greens, but that's a personal preference. Overall they were quite good. Small cornbread muffin was just right: a little sweet and not too dry. Hoppin' John was amazing! Had a ""ham bone cooked with the beans"" flavor. Fantastic!The Mac and cheese was perfection: tender pasta, perfect cheese sauce, and not overly thick. Delicious. And finally, the tuna catfish. Amazing!!' Soft tofu encrusted with cornmeal and fried. The tarter sauce MADE these. Good flavor in the crust, but tofu, as most everyone knows, is naturally bland. The spices in the crust, and the perfect cook dipped in the beautiful sauce made this the highlight of the meal. This place is a real treasure!"
4 star rating,"I came here back in April and just realized I never reviewed which is a shame because their food is amazing! I am not from Detroit,  so I am only comparing to NY/NJ vegan restaurants, but everything was great! The service may have been on the slow side (especially since I came almost right as they ooened) but that's probably just the New Yorker in me, so it didn't change my opinion of the place.I got the chicken bacon wrap and it was THE most incredible vegan wrap I have ever had. The fries it came with were oversalted but I still ate most of them because the wrap was just that good!I personally don't know of any places in tri-state area that do it like this so I was definitely taken aback. Fresh lettuce, delicious chikn, and that coconut bacon!! That was certainly the cherry on top. The server was a sweetheart too I specially remember and I even got a shirt because why not! When on vacation (of sorts) it's fun to act like a tourist. When I come back next year I will definitely return here and got some other stuff."
5 star rating,"One meal here is not enough to explore the menu.  Vegan never tasted so good so I'm eating here everyday while I'm in town.  Day 1:  tofu bites, smothered tempeh, hibiscus punch and strawberry dream.  So, so good.Okay, Day 2 here was just as good.  The catfish tofu platter was a satisfying mix.  I'll be here one more time before I leave Detroit.Well, time didn't allow me a Day 3 here.  That's too bad.  Whenever I'm in Detroit again, I'll definitely return to Vegan Soul."
4 star rating,"This is a cool little place located in a redone area with Detroit homes surrounding it. A friend of mine is Vegan and wanted to try this place out. There were three of us and we all were interested in the Soul Food Platter which is Mac and cheese, tenderly smoked collards garnished with shiitake mushroom, maple glazed yams topped with raisins and pecans, hoppin john (black eyed peas over rice topped with green onion) and a cornbread muffin which is $14. I particularly liked the collard greens which were great even without being cooked with the traditional pork. The muffin was perfectly sweet and one of the best I've had in a while. This was my first time trying hoppin john and I was impressed. I also was interested in the Green Life Smoothie  which is Spinach, kale, pineapple, avocado, dates, and coconut water and costs $7 This was my favorite item that I tried. You could taste the the greens first with a pineapple coconut finish. I'd come back here just for this."
4 star rating,"Wasnt impressed. Had the soul platter, vegan mac n cheese was ok, no cornbread, they ran out of collard greens so they gave us some crunchy kale greens which was not the lick at all, some bland black eyed peas with no seasoning whatsoever over brown rice sitting in a puddle of warm water (smh), yams with no type of sugar, and a side of tofu catfish which was thin sliced tofu fried in cornmeal and salt and pepper. The tofu is flavorless of course so it was pretty much like eating the leftover crumbs when you fry catfish.  This was the best item we had, only because it was the only thing that was seasoned besides the kale greens. The person i was with had the barbecue tofu, which was fried unseasoned lukewarm tofu swimming in a thick and overly sweetened soup of sauce that tasted like open pit straight out of the bottle. Let me find out. Nah, there was not one single solitary bit of soul coursing through this food, we don't cook like this. This is some hipster type stuff. Also it was really expensive, entree with an iced tea(with no sugar in it which is definitely not how we make it) was almost 25 dollars. Took 15 minutes for the waitress to even acknowledge us, and another 30-40 minutes before our food came out. And the portions were really small, especially given how much it cost. They would be better off just cooking veggies with soul food spices and seasonings rather than trying to make vegan renditions of meat flavored or based foods. I mean almost all soul food is either meat or flavored with meat, I don't think this is a plausible thing to even attempt and expect great success from. But they had a pretty full seating area so i guess they have a demographic whos looking for this. As for me personally, I boo this place."
2 star rating,"VEGAN FOOD VEGAN FOOD YAH! For all those that follow my vegan reviews. Here is a spot that I recommend you hit. They have two locations and have different menus at both so you should try both. But, Detroit has a good amount of vegan spots that you should go to so you may want to pick one of their two restaurants. I order the soul platter and it was tasty. I was torn between that and the smothered tempeh, but they were out of tempeh so my choice was easy. The Mac and cheese was really good and the kale too ( they were out of the collard greens)! The corn bread could have been more warm in my opinion and the sweet potatoes were nice and sweet and added a great taste to this platter. I was so stuffed I couldn't even finish everything.  I also tried a bite of the bacon ranch wrap and I liked it too. However, it tasted like there wasn't any ranch on it so I asked if they forgot to put it on  but the staff said that they just don't put much on it but then proceeded to bring a Side of it out so that was nice. The potato chips that come with this dish are really good. I would say it was my favorite thing that I ate at this place. However, the green smoothie was really amazing and refreshing too.I was so stuffed and didn't have any room... but... their cakes looked really really good. This spot lost a star because they were out of multiple items which is a bummer because they just opened for the day. LGBTQ+ foodies out there - this business is owned by an LGBTQ+ couple so show your love and support and give this restaurant some love. Anyways, Vegans or non-vegans, I recommend you hit this place up. Oh, and there is a gorgeous floral mural outside that would be a great spot for some quick pictures with friends."
4 star rating,"I had higher expectation for this place, but a little bit disappointed. I like it's 100% vegan and they try to use organic as long as they can. But the flavor has a lot to improve. We came on a Saturday afternoon, and waited for about 20 minutes. Later the places get more empty tables, maybe just the time we came has lots of people. The service is not good, we had to ask to refill water. We ordered soup, which come with a small corn bread. We were told the corn bread need to wait 15 minutes, but it never came. I'm pretty sure the corn bread was ready later, the corn bread in my entree came, but the corn bread supposed to come with the soup never showed up...The tomato basil soup is really good! The vegan version is amazing! This is my favorite one that night. I also got a Vegan Soul Plate, which is a bit disappointing. The mac&cheese is not good at all. I think it's better to take this out from the menu if they cannot make good vegan mac&cheese. The other items (rice, beans, sweet potato) on the plate are OK, but not much difference compare the one you can make at home. It's a boring dish overall.My friend got the tofu catfish likes it. The DVS burger is great! I might give a 4-star review if I ordered the burger."
3 star rating,"I would love to love Detroit Vegan Soul but it's kind of stuck in time. I like their burger and soul platter, and their German chocolate cake is to die for! I just wish they did some innovation with the menu."
3 star rating,"Not the place to go if you have a nut alergy. Yes, you can order some items...but its not the stuff you'd hope for. My date ate this beautiful meal that they recommend...i had a smoothie that took 15 minutes to make."
3 star rating,"A friend recommended we go and I was super skeptical. What? VEGAN soul food? We were plesantly surprised. The food was tasty and flavorful with only a shadow of the oily, yummy, heavy, goodness that is soul food. I got the ""catfish"" sandwhich which looked like fried catfish but lacks the umami of the real thing. Nevertheless it was tasty. Comes with coleslaw and the potatoes were delicious. Friend got the soul food platter and it was surprisingly good. I was especially impressed by the collards that were really good even without bacon or pork belly.Serbice was prompt, friendly, and gracious. We were in a rush to get to the airport and they accommodated our rushed schedule. I love when a restaurant anticipates a customer's needs - our waitress brought our check to the table when she saw we were done before I asked for it. Well done all."
4 star rating,"I was really let down by this place as I was really excited to try it. After ordering an array of food there wasn't much I really enjoyed from it. The bbq tofu came out cold, the cornbread was hard and tasteless, black eyed peas were kind bland, and the collards were very salty. I expected a lot better especially for the price of each plate. I always hate to leave a downer review but my experience was just not good."
2 star rating,"Holy cow. This place was AWESOME. Being vegetarian, I am so appreciative for great places like this!!Parking: plenty of street parkingService: fantastic!Ambiance: really niceFood: -coconut BLT wrap with raw collard wrap (So freaking delicious!!!)- but did not like the red skin potatoes. Too much oil. -Seitan pepper steak: very good I would definetely come out!!"
5 star rating,"This place was so good I wanted to die, reanimate, then sit down and eat again as a zombie because zombies don't have to worry about how it looks to hwarf down three platters of food and a shake and a piece of cake at one sitting. They just do it. This place, if it weren't for Surya Cafe in Madison, WI, would be the best vegan restaurant ever - and it IS the best soul food anywhere. We got two platters and shared them. EVERYTHING, absolutely everything - arrived at the table at the perfect temperature, texture and flavor. Ever been to a vegan restaurant that can't get the food in the window? Or the service is slow? This is NOT that place. My friends are omnivores and they were in heaven. The German Chocolate cake is to die for. Just get here. Take a plane or a cab. Do what you have to do but get here and EAT."
4 star rating,I had high expectations for this place since I love seeing vegan places but to be honest it was just average in my opinion. I liked the catfish tofu but everything else seemed bland for palette. I think I would have appreciated more flavor in my food. I think it's good that the restaurant is trying but I was personally not impressed. Great dynamic & friendly staff though! I'm not sure if I'd return to this place.
3 star rating,#mynewveganlife. Detroit style!  Back in the D and exploring my new lifestyle in my old stomping grounds.  DVS is a quaint little gem in a great neighborhood.  Staff is friendly and the food is on point!!
5 star rating,"Detroit Vegan Soul is a comfy place set in a quiet, quaint neighborhood.  If you're there on a nice day, you'll want to make sure you set aside sometime to take a stroll.I've been meaning to visit Detroit Vegan Soul for a long while now, and finally up and went by myself after work one evening, since it's pretty close to work and pretty far from home.  I was pleasantly pleased with the ambiance, the service, and the menu - which offers a wide variety of apps, sandwiches, salads, and entrees.I sort of liked the entree I ordered, which was the BBQ tofu.  And by sort of, I mean this:  The BBQ sauce itself was deliciously tangy, but the tofu was, in my opinion, over cooked.  The kale and potato salad were both tasty, but the spice(s) on the corn on the cob overpowered the flavor of the corn (turmeric?  I'm not that good at identifying spices).The smoothie I ordered was delightfully refreshing.  It is called Tropical Breeze.  I ordered mine made with coconut water. The fruit in the smoothie was mango, pineapple, banana, and dates.  Yum!I will definitely dine at Detroit Vegan Soul again.  Now that I've tried it out, I can recommend it to all my vegetarian friends."
3 star rating,"Excellent Food. Great Vibe. Great Service.My wife had the Soul Plate, I have the Vegan Millet Patty , Cole Slew And Red Potato Fries.Great stop for authentic vegan soul food"
5 star rating,"So far we've been here for 37 minutes waiting on 2 ""Soul Plates"" we finished our water and waited 9 mins for a refill on that. The place wasn't to busy when we came in. But I doubt that would provoke any haste in service. I'm beginning to wonder if the cook came into work today...We got our plates 47 minutes after ordering themAll in all the food was okay Portions small I've never had worse ""cornbread"" in my life. It's as dry as if they just served you corn meal Get the greens they were cool"
2 star rating,"I was in Detroit over the weekend and went back to this place TWICE. I always have to try the mac-n-cheese wherever I go, even though it is usually not that impressive. I must say that I was impressed!!!! It is just a little cup for $6.00 but sooooo yummy! I ofcourse had to try some of the desserts sitting out front. I got the German Chocolate. It was okay - nothing special. I also got the Southern Fired Tofu Wrap. I really liked this but you have to enjoy tofu. The net day I got one of the tofu 'egg' scramble wraps - the sauce in this was yum yum, beware it was loaded with big spinach leaves. Overall I really liked this place. It is the closest vegan place to Grosse Pointe Park I believe. I loved that on Sunday morning it was PACKED full with people from every walk of life. Great Vibe!!! **I must always note that I gave 5 stars to the Chicago Diner - and sorry but all other restaurants are now compared to that - so my 4 star is pretty great, just not as good as the most amazing place I have ever eaten :)"
4 star rating,"Really enjoyed my first try of Vegan cuisine the service , food and atmosphere was amazing I can't wait until I'm there to visit again I encourage you all to try this place"
5 star rating,"My wife and I stopped in for dinner. Great customer service, very reasonable pricing, and delicious food! The menu has a wide variety of options including mains, sandwiches, soups and salads, smoothies and shakes. There is sure to be something here for everyone to enjoy. All plant based and extremely good dining. Ample street parking available."
4 star rating,"So freaking good! I have a friend who is vegetarian, and we were trying to find somewhere new to go. I'd heard if DVS a lot over the past couple of years and suggested that!! We made reservations for 6:45, and were seated right away (there was no one else in there). The area is so so cute, and we were able to people watch out of the window. She ordered the catfish sandwich with a side of collard greens, and I got the soul platter with a side of green beans. Everything was immaculate. My friend loved the sandwich and the potatoes that come on the side are so good. Her grandma is a soul food connoisseur, and she said the collards my friend brought home were great. My soul platter was phenomenal. I'd never had soul food before and I am so happy I started here! The perfect mixture of the best parts of soul food, and I'm sincerely looking forward to going back to try something else! I wish I remembered to snap pics, but the food looked so good and I was so hungry that I dug right in."
5 star rating,"One of the best all vegetarian/restaurants I've dined at, to date. My husband and I visited Detroit for the weekend after reading an article in the travel section of VegNews that highlighted the vegan-friendliness of the city. We stopped in for lunch on Saturday and enjoyed it so much that we changed our Sunday brunch plans and returned again for brunch. The food is delicious, our server was very attentive and helpful, and it's all vegan - which makes dining out a much more enjoyable and comfortable experience. I would highly recommend checking out Detroit Vegan Soul if you're looking for tasty vegan food in the city, or an omnivore looking to branch out and try something new."
4 star rating,"As a vegetarian, I LOVED this place. It's small, but thankfully we've never had an unbearable wait. I do wish they had some cans of Coke or something to drink besides water because I do really like my soda when eating out, but I get that it doesn't ""go"" with their vibe. My husband, who is not a vegetarian, enjoys it and is always happy to join me there for a meal. The kids, however, aren't super crazy about the fake cheese and different textures, but they do finish it."
4 star rating,"First time staying in west village and we were very happy to know that this place was only steps away from our airbnb. The service is a 5 out of 5And the food was out of this world, it made me feel like we were at gran's house on a Sunday afternoon having brunch with the family. The food here is good and wholesome. We had the catfish tofu and the smothered tempeh and both were delicious, gran would approved! This place has become a staple and every time we come to Detroit it will be a mandatory stop. Cannot wait to be back!"
5 star rating,"Decided to try something different and wanted to try a vegan soul restaurant, since I was in town for an NSBE conference. Ordered the soul platter and the hibiscus punch and we got our food promptly, but we never received the cornbread that was listed on the menu. The punch and macaroni was really good. I am shocked that the vegan mac had no cheese, it was that GOOD!  Also, ordered a side of the tofu catfish and when paired with the tartar sauce is convincing that you're eating catfish.Everything else lacked flavor and the yams were dry as well. Service - 2.5 (waitress wasn't that attentive)Food - 3Venue -4 (nice)"
3 star rating,"Really cute spot and food is fantastic Smothered tempeh, Mac & cheese, & candied yams!"
5 star rating,"Completely exceeded my expectations. I typically find vegan soul food to be very heavy, salty, and simply not something I would eat every day.This place is completely different-very fresh tasting ingredients and not oily or too salty whatsoever. I ordered the Soul Platter which for $14 included collard greens (perfectly cooked with tomatoes and onions), 2 mini corn muffins, sweet potatoes, black eyed peas, and Mac n cheese. Everything tastes incredible and the Mac n cheese was one of the best I've ever eaten. The portion was perfect, and the food didn't make me feel heavy or gross. Our waitress was lovely, and they accept all major credit cards. You must come here if you are in Detroit!"
5 star rating,"Detroit Vegan Soul is a great place to eat in Detroit, for both the die hard Vegan, and the die hard Carnivore. As someone who used to be insistent on having meat with every meal, this restaurant was pretty eye opening as to how good food can be, even without meat! They've got a pretty solid selection of dishes, and there's generally something for everyone. Many of the dishes are twists on meat-based or meat-centered dishes you'd normally see, but they taste fantastic and don't try to trick you into thinking they are meat. The one downside of the restaurant is that it is pretty small inside, so if you are trying to have any remotely large group (4+), I'd say look somewhere else, as either there won't be enough space or you'll be waiting quite a while for a table. However if you have a small group, it's a very nice and cozy atmosphere and the dishes prepared are very ""instagrammable"". Keto/ Low Carb folks: You might want to look for another spot to eat, as substitutes for meat can be on the carb-heavy side, the restaurant is dairy/egg/lactose free, and the sandwiches/ burgers aren't an option."
4 star rating,"My girlfriend lives right by here but hadn't tried it. I've been back for a bit and hadn't either, so we gave it a go - so glad we did! Note, be sure you are aware of the hours/days of operation. We arrived right around the end of breakfast and beginning of lunch time on a Saturday and immediately got a seat. When we left there was a wait, but it didn't seem like people were waiting too long. The outdoor area is apparently for take-out orders only, FYI. Food arrived pretty quickly for the amount of people in the restaurant/getting take-out.DVS Breakfast Sandwich (8/10): I love when vegan food comes with ""egg"". This sandwich was delicious, though I didn't get much of an egg flavor (not bad, just not too strong). Everything was fresh and the bread was tasty with a nice crunch, while the sauce was wonderful. In fact, I wish there had been more sauce! I got the red skin ""fries"" (they're really more like warm chips). They were full of flavor with excellent crisp. Bacon Ranch Tofu Wrap (9/10): Wow! My girlfriend won the ""dish off"" this time! The smokey flavor is one of the best either of us has tried. I was shocked she let me have so many bites since this thing was so darn good. Crispy, flavorful, smokey, just all around great. She ordered the yam ""fries"" and they weren't as good as the red skin. Still flavorful and crispy though! Tomato Basil Soup with Corn Bread (7/10): Soup was tasty and warm, had a bit of a kick. Perhaps it was just not matching well with my meal, but I didn't crave more of it, though it was still well done. I always eat corn bread and think ""that's dry,"" but then I think that must just be how corn bread is. It was tasty and would be even better if we had put some butter on top for the parts we didn't toss in the soup. They serve desserts and lots of other options that we will try on future visits. Can't wait to go again."
4 star rating,"I've heard so many great reviews about this place and I was so excited to try it. As a vegetarian who is trying to transition over into veganism, I was so excited that I would still be able to enjoy soul food without sacrificing the staples, but I was pretty disappointed in my meal. I had the soul platter. The mac n cheese was probably the best thing on the plate. The cornbread was hard, the yams were super bland, and the collard greens and black-eyed pea tasted like straight salt! I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt and assume that the cook was just having an off day because so many people swear by this restaurant. Hopefully, if I decide to come back the food will be better."
2 star rating,Excellent delicious food! Service was a little slow but that's because it's so good and popular
5 star rating,This was just not my cup of tea. I'm not the slightest bit vegan or vegetarian so I just wasn't  satisfied. I wouldn't go back but I do recommend this place for vegans.
4 star rating,"I'm not vegan, but boy do I love me a good vegan restaurant. Whereas the plant-based options at most restaurants leave you feeling like you've missed out on the good stuff (cheese! eggs! dairy!), thoughtful vegan cooking is deeply satisfying and nourishing. When I planned a weekend staycation in Detroit with three friends, I was on the lookout for places that would be able to satisfy a vegetarian, a meat-lover, a meat-ambivalent omnivore, and a vegan with Celiac's and weird food allergies. Detroit Vegan Soul exceeded all of our expectations. The menu is fairly extensive, and clearly labels dishes that contain gluten or soy, and allows you to mix-n-match sides to create a plate of your own. Some standouts for us were: - Really, really, ridiculously good coffee. - Mac n cheese. (We still don't understand how pasta with cheese sauce could be made so deliciously and creamily without any dairy or wheat!)- Candied yams- Smothered tempeh - Catfish tofu- Attentive, friendly serviceDefinitely kid-friendly, suitable for groups up to 8 or so. The lighting is bright and the ambiance is casual (more cafe than restaurant), which is great for breakfast/brunch/lunch or a dinner with friends."
5 star rating,"Yummy choices,  very good service and  nice to visit a local small biz place while visiting in Detroit. Everything was hot and fresh. We had the millet burgers and potato rounds and tried a small dish of the eggplant meatballs and pasta just for a taste!"
4 star rating,"Came here with a friend on a Saturday for lunch. We weren't familiar with the area so we weren't sure what to expect. We parked around the corner on the street and admired the big houses nearby. We both decided the block the restaurant was on seemed ""hipster"". Once inside we were promptly seated and we both agreed the inside had a fun, ""green"" feel to it. Everything on the menu seemed good so we had a hard time deciding. I got the coconut BLT sandwich with yam chips and coleslaw. I have had fake bacon before and this was equally good with a smoky flavor. It was a lot of food for lunch I thought, I wasn't able to finish it all but it was still very good. The waitresses were very, very attentive and I like how our credit cards were swiped right at the table. I would come back if I were in the neighborhood!"
5 star rating,"I tried this place for the first time on Friday and it was SO GOOD (minus the dry black eye peas). I got the soul platter and my date got the catfish tofu meal. I was really surprised by how good everything was given it was vegan. But I have to admit, we were pretty hungry a couple hours later LOL. My three star rating is due to the service - although our waitress was very friendly and accommodating, we watched other people that came AFTER US eat and leave before we even got our food."
3 star rating,The food at Detroit Vegan Soul is always off the chain but it is always SO slow! 90% of the time it's slow! Every now in then you luck out and not have to wait for your food! This time we actually went next door to do someShopping at The local florist and still HAD TO WAIT! it was a bowl of chili and 1 meal! Its definitely the weak link at DVS!
2 star rating,"First of all, what a cute little place!  I love West Village, and I especially love that Detroit Vegan Soul and Craftwork are pioneers in creating a little retail space there.  Also, their decor and logo are super cute; I love that Spring green color.Now, on to the rest.  The service was great - everyone was super friendly even though we were ordering carryout and kind of in the way.  They let us know how long things were taking and checked in with us until we got our food. There was a pleasant lunch crowd - lots of families with children, and they all seemed to be enjoying themselves. Now, the FOOD!  It's vegan, so of course you want to know about that.  First, ORDER THE TOFU ""CATFISH"".  It is seriously amazing.  And the vegan tartar sauce tasted exactly like regular fatty tartar sauce.  Exactly. I'm not kidding.  I wouldn't kid about mayo tasting like mayo. Second, don't order the mac n cheese.  It's not their fault.  There is no such thing as good vegan cheese. Lol  In addition, though the cornbread muffin tasted really good, it was a little dense.Everything else I tried was delicious, even the black eyed peas over brown rice, which I've never liked before.  The smoked greens were seriously good, and that's surprising, seeing as how they weren't cooked with any meat.  The yams were soft and sweet and I'd order those again.  The tofu ""chicken"" wrap was really good, and the yam fries were yum.All in all? Go here!  Even if you're just playing around with the idea of vegan food, this place will make you a believer and will give you some great ideas to take home. (Coconut bacon, what!?)  I can't wait to try more of their sandwiches and their desserts."
4 star rating,"My cousin and I was so excited to find a plant base restaurant in the city. They're so few and far in-between. We're even more excited that one is going to be actually in the city closer to where we are. I can't wait for them to open, the food here was it delicious. My father and my cousin and I went for lunch and we were not disappointed it was so hearty and flavorful. And they have sweets! You can tell that they really took their time with each of our dishes.-KissTheNyx -Plantbased foodaholic and sweettooth junkie"
5 star rating,"Hello, my name is Sanchaz Brown and I'm going to tell you about the best Vegan food I've ever had in my life! Beautiful Sunday in Detroit, my fiance and I decided to take a personal trip to Detroit Vegan Soul. We were in Detroit visiting friends, but couldn't pass the opportunity to spend some quality couple time, and there was no better place to do it!I went with the Vegan Chicken and Waffles, and the Vegan Biscuits and Gravy. Both were absolutely outstanding. Absolutely delicious. The Vegan fried chicken may have been the best chicken I've ever had. Vegan or not. The waffle with the homemade syrup was great, very crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. I absolutely loved it. So delicious. The biscuits were moist and warm and delicious. Home gravy with vegan sausage in it. I honestly could've put that gravy on a shoe and eaten it. It was THAT good.My fiance had the Vegan Sunday Dinner, which came with candied yams, cornbread, greens, and mac and cheese. She loved it. took her maybe 10 minutes to finish the dish because it was so good. It looked amazing, and so traditionally southern. Very, very good. She also had the tofu scrambler dish and that was amazing as well.All in all, this was some of the best Vegan food I've ever had! Nothing was bad, nothing was even ""good"". EVERYTHING was great or better, and I find that amazing. My next time in Detroit, I intend on stopping here multiple times. May be the only restaurant I visit. If i had to recommend anything specific, the Vegan Fried Chicken will be one of the most amazing things you've ever eaten. But what do I know? I'm just a Yelp Elite."
5 star rating,"I was very skeptical about giving this place a try, but I will say I'm glad I did because I was pleasantly surprised! The food was great! I had the ""Catfish"" Tofu which was Catfish Battered Tofu, Broccoli/Corn Medley, and Redskin Potatoes & Onions. The dish was super flavorful and surprisingly filling. The only complaint that I have is the wait for our food was a little lengthy. Def give this place a try if you want to try something new!"
4 star rating,"Stayed in Detroit for a night - for a concert ...this place was in between our hotel and the venue. Decor is cute; bright and modern. Clean, but not spacious. There's not really anywhere to stand, to wait for a table - so we went outside. (It was super crowded on a Saturday afternoon....) After about 30min we were seated. Ordered, and another 30min until our food was served.At that time we already blew an hour and had to get going to the show, or we'd miss the first few performers. We scarfed down a few bites and took the rest to go. The food is actually really good; super fresh, health conscious, very tasty (meals did taste like meat - not plants), decent proportions, not too pricey, employees were extremely helpful and friendly.My only drawback being from the Chicago suburbs - we had no idea how long the wait time would be and how many people dined here. So we didn't fully get to experience Detroit Vegan Soul, since we had to box our food to go and eat it cold after a 7 hour concert, heh..But we will be returning again, when visiting Detroit."
4 star rating,"One of the best vegan spots I've been too. From the black eyed peas, Mac and cheese (the best), flavorful greens and OH MY the catfish!!  Even if you eat meat you MUST visit because it's all that good!!"
5 star rating,"Who says vegan food can't be comforting, rich, even decadent? Each time I'm at Vegan Soul, I'm reminded how delicious healthy food can be. As a bonus, the giant windows and natural light here make for a perfect spot to catch up with a friend or read a book at the counter while eating something that's as good as it is good for you!"
5 star rating,Awesome vegan soul food! Excellent menu. Clean food. Fast counter service. Cool up & coming neighborhood. Highly recommend it!
5 star rating,"I've been so excited to try This restaurant and last weekend my daughter, who is vegetarian, was talking about missing catfish and I knew we had to go. We went with a friend of ours who is gluten free but were assured that wouldn't be a problem. When we arrived all three gluten free entrees were out for the day. Surprising given we came at 12 for lunch and were the only ones in the restaurant. We then waited over and hour for our food to arrive and when it did the supposedly gluten free bun was not, which my friend with celiac discovered half way through her sandwich. The food was tasty and interesting. I had the catfish tofu, sweet potatoes and collard greens. All really good but the collard greens were outstanding. However not, wait an hour and poison my out of town guest outstanding."
3 star rating,"I feel like I have a responsibility to let people know how bad this place is. I ordered the Soul Platter and it was utterly dry and tasteless and worse than cafeteria food. It looked good in the photos which is why I decided to give it a shot, as a non-vegan, in the first place. I guess it's all looks and no taste here. It's in the bougie side of Detroit if you can call it that. The waitress was super nice though and only charged me for the cornbread and collard greens that I ate, but it would've been 1 star if not for her."
2 star rating,"I went for the first time this past Saturday! EXCELLENT food and service, I was very pleased. I hope the owners consider expanding; they could benefit from doing so."
5 star rating,I was looking forward to trying this place out..I ordered to-go and when I went inside it was jam packed. I got my food quickly afterwards. I tried the fish fillet with mash potatoes and collard greens. The fish was really dry. They also didn't give me any sauce to go with it. All that for $14??.. EhThe people who work there didn't seem to enthused. It was ok customer service.
3 star rating,"DVS burger all the way. It's delicious! Also love the tomato soup and grilled ""cheese"" sandwich. Great addition to the neighborhood. Not only is the food good it's in a Super cute, bright and cheery location."
5 star rating,"I am unable to review the quality of the food because we were never even able to try it. I'm new to the Detroit vegan community, and had heard great things about this place and decided to take someone there as a special date, because he's vegan and I'm not. Imagine how appalled I was when what was supposed to be a nice date night went south, fast. We went last Thursday around 6:30pm. We walked in, there were plenty of open tables. The lady at the counter saw us but did not acknowledge us in any way--not even a smile to denote she saw us. She just kept chatting with the chick at the counter who was picking up a takeout order. Okay, whatever, that's fine. Then there was a second worker behind the counter who engaged the take out lady in conversation. Okay cool, maybe it's super enthralling, fine. Someone enters the restaurant and immediately gets a nice warm greeting from both women behind the counter. I'm feeling pretty embarrassed at how this is turning out in front of my date. We're waiting at the ""Please Wait To Be Seated"" sign. For the next TEN MINUTES. Without even a single ""we'll be right with you!"" or even a single smile or a wave to acknowledge the fact that we were two adults looking to spend some money on some good food. Ten minutes was enough. If I wanted to go somewhere looking to spend money and be ignored, I'd go to Macy's. I don't know if it's because we were guys, or what. But it was not the warm, accepting atmosphere I've experienced of the vegan community elsewhere. Absolutely atrocious. My date was not impressed, and he was severely disappointed by your staff and business.[posted from a friends account]"
1 star rating,"Fiancé and I went here on a Sunday for brunch. Although the food was good, especially the catfish tofu, we will never return. The place was a little busy, but the service was extremely slow. It took a full hour just to get our food after we had ordered, for two people!Worse part about the whole experience was our encounter with the owner. She was a smug, ungrateful, and rude person. The least you could do is smile at your customers who are coming to your place and spending money with you. At least fake a smile and make people feel a little welcome. We asked if we could substitute a side with another side, a seemingly uncomplicated request, her facial expression was as if we'd just trampled her firstborn son, then she grumbled a ""no"" before briskly walking away from us. Lighten up a little, lady."
4 star rating,"The catfish tofu sandwich was so so good - highly recommend! Tofu pieces were crispy and flavorful, sauce was perfect. We also had the coconut bacon BLT and a side of Mac and Cheese. It was my first time eating coconut bacon so that was exciting! Very smoky and satisfying. The rest of the BLT, esp the wrap, was so so. The side of Mac and Cheese was yummy but didn't blow our minds either..we felt that the 'cheese' flavor fell a bit flat. On the other hand, yam chips and potatoes were well seasoned and addicting. Next time, we will order like 500 catfish tofu sandwiches (with yam chips), skip the Mac and Cheese, and try their PVS burger/some of their other sides. Limited seating but it wasn't too busy when we went (around 1pm on a Saturday). Service was great and restaurant is bright and airy. We found parking right across the street. (There's a beautiful mural there!) I usually have to smoosh vegan places into the itinerary because my boyfriend thinks a meal without meat isn't a meal, but even he was pleasantly surprised. We'll definitely be back!"
5 star rating,I absolutely love this place!! I always go for the soul food platter because it has a little bit of everything and it's delicious!! Servers are always friendly!
5 star rating,This is my FAVORITE VEGAN RESTAURANT in the D'.... I met these ladies at VEGMICHIGAN.when this restaurant dream was only on paper... I'm so proud and happy to support this venture. And I will continue as a patron and as a walking Billboard.
5 star rating,"Yummy. So good. DVS is delightful. It is tasty and it is a local, small business. I love to eat, and I like to spend locally, so those people who work at, and own small businesses, can also shop locally. Keeping that circular economy tasty."
5 star rating,"Nice staff, food is okay. Everything has soy in it... 99% of soy is genetically modified. It defeats the purpose of being vegan if all the food contains GMO. Might as well eat meat! Somewhat disappointing. Need better cleaner healthier options."
3 star rating,"Finally! My first review of this place. I've been on several occasions and I get the same outcome great food! Oh yea and it's totally VEGAN hence the name VEGAN SOUL ha! Ok ok... So I ordered the tempeh wrap and a friend the PVS burger I believe? And both were delicious. Flavorful and filling what more can u really ask for from a meal/ restaurant... Right ? But wait there's more. The ambiance is so cool and laid back and friendly. Everyone is smiling and In a great mood( on every visit) and u feel the energy but wait there's more you can literally eat ur meal off the floor it's so clean in there. Both meals came with a side of redskin potatoes and Cole slaw-- straight fresh and tasty ... Simple The decor was cool  clean  and classic, my style. As a kid i stayed across the street at the Parkhurst apartments and only can remember a tiny grocery/ convenient  store on the corner of the block and a tea/ coffee house in the row.  Nice to see this area has more business up that people frequent on a regular. I also recommend the okra soup and Mac and cheese."
5 star rating,"I believe you get five stars just for opening a vegan soul food joint in the West Village of Detroit!But beyond that, the food did not disappoint.It was our first time so we ordered one Soul Food Plate, (Mac and cheese, greens, black eyed peas, etc), because they're obviously known for it, and then we added the catfish tofu to the other plate.  We loved everything!Staff is friendly and atmosphere is relaxed, perfect for the food served.We will definitely be back to try weekday menu and desserts.Warning that they restrict menu on Sunday, I assume because it's a small kitchen and I wouldn't show up with a group and expect a table quickly.  It's a small place and you're getting in quicker with a party of two...  I was surprised by how many larger groups we saw trying to get in today.  (Tip:  large groups also tend to linger, talk and hang out so you're taking up unnecessary space and time from a small place like this as well). Break yourself up into two smaller groups and eat sooner!"
5 star rating,"Amazing food! Had the veggie burger with a side of mac and cheese. As a non vegan the mac and cheese really threw me off taste wise (maybe because im just not used to it?) Otherwise service was amazing, so many options and i will def be back"
4 star rating,What A Wonderful Vegan Restaurant We Had The MAC & Cheese Ribs Greens Yams I Must Say They Tasted Yummy An Looked Amazing Detroit Vegan We Will Be Back...
5 star rating,"I eat a lot of vegetarian and usually stay away from vegan because I love my cheeses. But I was very happily surprises here.I had a kale salad add tempeh and avocado. Had several kale salads and usually there isn't much to them but this was really good.Also ordered from the appetizer menu the fried tofu. This was amazing, and I highly recommend. One issue its not served during lunch but if you ask nicely they will do it!Service was really fast and friendly. And the neighborhood is really quite quaint once you are there."
4 star rating,"Awesome food with cute ambiance. First time visiting here and it was a great experience. We didn't' have to wait for a table and the staff was friendly and helpful in recommending dishes to us. I ordered the BBQ Tofu plate and it was really flavorful, slightly spicy and really delicious. It came with cooked kale, corn on the cob and potato salad. The potatoes were a little too crunchy for my liking, but the flavors were really bold and delicious. My husband ordered the Seitan Stir Fry plate and ate the entire thing - so I'm guessing he was a fan! I also ordered their okra stew which was really good. Although, it said it had brown rice in it and I actually don't think mine had rice but millet or some other grain like quinoa. It was more soup-y than stew-y but still really great flavor. Save room for dessert - the carrot cake was great.Overall good experience and we likely will be back. Parking is available on the street where you can find it and prices are average (a little expensive for Detroit IMO, but it's OK)."
4 star rating,Black eyed peas bland no taste at all. Mac n cheese the coconut substitute throws off the flavor greens and sweet potatoes are good. Overall soso meal not a place i would have to revisit.
3 star rating,"The food is good but the service in the afternoon is generally pretty bad. Today I called in to place a carry-out order, but I was immediately put on hold for an unacceptable amount of time. I disconnected and called back only to get a busy signal for the next 10-15 minutes. When I showed up there we're at least 8 employees doing literally nothing and only a single other customer. I told them about the phone. The response was ""oh yeah, there was a phone call"". Great.The young lady behind the counter needs to up her customer service game as well. Not a single thank you or please come again. This seems to be a symptom of Detroit in general, as a great many service workers I've encountered seem to suffer from an inability to even pretend be pleasant.So I did eventually get my food, a full 40 minutes after my initial call, but the experience left me sour.Such a shame for a place with decent food to mar their image with sub-par service. My guess is the pool of available workers with the right stuff is quite small. I'll probably give them another chance though."
4 star rating,"This place is the real deal. I ordered the Soul Platter and wished that I had ordered 2 of them. My daughter ordered the Catfish Tofu sandwich. We both were very pleased with our meals. Everything was seasoned well, service was great. Didn't have to wait too long for our carryout. I'm hoping to return soon."
5 star rating,"Dine in service is friendly and To go orders are fast. When I first made it into town this was the first location I visited. I got the DVS burger aside salad and red skin potatoes. Everything was wonderful. I came back the next day ordered the same w mushrooms/ onions/ cheese/ and bacon. A side salad redskin potatoes came with it and I ordered a smoothie as well. Man o man it was good. I wish I was in town now, I would get another one. The combination is simply addictive. Next time I'm in town I'm coming here and I'm eating in. Erica was my waitress, she was helpful, nice, and attentive."
5 star rating,"Very slow service. Allow 2 hours to order, be served and eat if you're dining here at lunchtime. Some of the items were interesting. They could have used some spice."
3 star rating,"Awesome awesome food!!! I really need to come back and write a more detailed review.  The collard greens were great, I had seitan steak which was AWESOME"
5 star rating,"Really cute place :) love the ambiance- the soul food platter I ordered because it seemed the most popular, but tbh I wasn't a fan. The collard greens were extremely salty, the Mac and cheese was not flavorful, and the black eye peas tasted burnt. The cornbread muffin was great, wished there was more of it, and the sweet potatoes were simple but good. (Probably a 2/5)The BBQ tofu burger was completely different- packed with flavor and delicious among the dude salad and yam chips which were crispy yet soft :) (5/5)Dessert was pretty good! Strawberry cobbler with (I think) coconut milk vanilla ice cream. Seemed a little too pricy tho. (4/5)I would come back again but definitely try a sandwich or something"
4 star rating,"As I currently live in Columbus, I will find myself thinking about Detroit Vegan Soul as it is one of the best places I've ever had the pleasure of eating. Visited Detroit twice last year and the second time, we stayed right down the street from here just to be able to eat here. It's really that good! Take your non-vegan and vegetarian friends here. Sure they'll gripe and what not, but if they aren't woo'd by DVS's drool-worthy catfish, or their amazing breakfast sandwich, or their incredible tofu-chicken n waffles... well- honestly, you need better friends then. The service is great and it's fantastic to see such a place in Detroit and makes me wonder why people are still obsessed with eating dead animals on the reg.I plan on staying near and eating here every time I check out Detroit, and I wish them the best of luck in business and hope they can expand and grow!"
5 star rating,"I visit Detroit often, and Detroit Vegan Soul is absolutely my favorite place to stop for food. Immediately when you walk in, you feel a sense of belonging which is only complimented by the amazing staff. The food is absolutely out of this world; if I could give the food beyond five stars, I would. It tastes amazing, but also, very fresh, like they picked up the ingredients just hours before. I would absolutely send anyone who visits Detroit to this place."
4 star rating,"Friendly staff but the food proved disappointingThe wrap along w/ the sides needed more seasoning. I was given rice I asked to be excluded. It was over cooked & mushy, the cornbread was rock hard & the greens under seasoned. The macaroni was good & yams combined w/the black-eyed peas helped with the flavor."
1 star rating,"My family and I (altogether a group of 5) came in for lunch. They told us it'd be a 20 minute wait - it ended up taking an hour. We kept asking what was taking so long, as we were the only ones waiting most of the time, and they told us they were waiting for a specific table to leave. The thing is, the place was half empty. There were many tables they could've moved together, but they seemed to be waiting on a specific one. We kept asking for an alternate way to be seated and they told us to either wait and sit as a group or be separated. We chose to be separated in the end because we were all super hungry and tired of waiting.When we were seated, we had to wait even more. We had been looking at the menu to see what we wanted while we waited, so we were all annoyed that we had to wait even longer for something we'd obviously already done. Some of the waiters saw us try to catch their eye to order and it seemed that they were trying to decide who would have to deal with us.We got the Seitan Pepper Steak ($13), ""Catfish"" Tofu ($12), and Southern Fried Tofu Wrap ($9). The Seitan Pepper Steak was alright; I'd give it 3/5 stars. The ""Catfish"" Tofu was delicious - way better than actual catfish, in my opinion. And the sauce for it was great. I would give it 5/5 stars. The Southern Fried Tofu Wrap was good overall (I'd give it 4/5 stars because the flavor was good, but it was a bit soggy), though the salad it came with wasn't good.We all left not very satisfied in a bad mood.If I was rating DVS solely on food, it would get 4 stars. It lost 2 more because of their customer service."
2 star rating,"Was expecting so much more soulful flavors then what came out to me in bowls and plates.I tried the soul platter with the Mac n cheese, collard greens, corn muffin, black eyed peas and rice, and maple yams, started off with a cup of the okra soup and ended my lunch with the pumpkin cupcake. The collard green was boring and flat and tasted liked boiled collards with no spice or flavoring, the yams tasted too perfumed and overly pungent of incense, the Mac was decent, the corn bread was far too dry and required copious swallows of water to get it down and the black eyed peas continued the spiral of boredom, the okra soup was decent, but could have used a bit more heat and flavoring and the pumpkin cupcake, too was dry, but the frosting was sweet and delicate. The meal was average and left me wanting something more to wipe away the entire boring experience. The vanilla cake with the Careb frosting was decent, mostly the frosting, of course."
3 star rating,"Small, cold and restricted. This place gives you what they give you and that's it. No substitutions and they charge way too much for the portion sizes and add ons. When I say it's cold I'm referring to the atmosphere and servers. From the site and yelp I gathered it would be a warm, friendly and accommodating place. The food is either too bland or too salty and God forbid you ask for ANYTHING they will say no, stand around the corner, roll their eyes and talk about you while making it evident that you are not welcome. I'm traveling and I was so excited but you can't win them all.  And I wrote this while sitting there waiting for them to ""fix"" my friend's order. After 20 minutes they brought her burger out to the person next to us. We decided to just leave and they offered nothing. Not even a verbal apology."
1 star rating,"The food was amazing! I was accompanied by my parent and we both came with high expectations and left fulfilled! Such great service, a great location and also the food was phenomenal. Can't wait to come back again! Thank you for your service!"
5 star rating,"The ponytail guy told us to wait outside after we ordered, because there wasn't enough room inside."
1 star rating,I have been on a quest to try the vegan diet. My first step was eating here at DVS. I ordered a BBQ tofu sandwich and it was delicious. I will be back to try the other meals on the menu. Very good sandwich and the environment was relaxed and positive. Looking for vegan menu try this place asap!
5 star rating,"DVS is definitely one of the better area vegan spots I've tried, but to be honest that's not really saying much. We liked our platter of veggie-fied soul food staples well enough (cornbread, Mac n cheese, black eyed peas, collard greens, yams) but it was not some sort of culinary sensation. I'm glad I left feeling relatively light and not overstuffed, though! The lemonade was way too sugary btw. Our waiter was nice! I would come back to try some other dishes. If you're a vegan you'll enjoy DVS but I think I'd rather have my collard greens cooked in animal fat, thank you (and I couldn't stop feeling like something was missing- fried chicken or rib tips, probably)."
3 star rating,"This place is small and sterile. Service is hit or miss and a lot of times the workers are slightly rude to put it bluntly.  I live within walking distance and it is disappointing they don't take to-go orders over the phone on weekends. Not a good business move to keep local clientele. The food is very good and I'm always impressed with the ALT sandwich. I recommend trying it for lunch. Overall, I would skip this place for dinner. Craft work next door has healthy options, less attitude, and way better ambiance."
2 star rating,"My catfish sandwich was incredibly good. Service was friendly, but inattentive (sitting on her phone every time I needed something). Sparkling water, or non-room-temp water of some kind would have made my meal much better. I hope they step up with the service, I'd love for them to stay in business."
4 star rating,I've been here twice now and both times the food was stellar. Both as delicious and comforting as you want soul food to be but none of the trouble of trying to figure out what might be plausibly meatless. I loved both the BBQ tofu sandwich and the tofu catfish sandwiches and can't imagine anything on the menu being less than tasty.
5 star rating,"I have always been a meat eater. Putting things into my body that unhealthily contributed to my high blood pressure.  I topped the scales at a whopping 450llbs  I'm a diabetic I've had a heart attack and I now have leg ulcers.  I felt like nothing would turn my slow ride to the grave.  Enter vegan soul...... this trendy spot,  ultra hip atmosphere and pleasing menu I now see hope where there was none.  Im down to 357llbs and I believe that things are now looking up for me thanks guys.  If I could give 10 stars I would"
5 star rating,"I'm not vegan or even vegetarian but I enjoyed this place. I had the candied yams, fish nuggets and collard greens. They were tasty. I highly recommend the lemonade!"
4 star rating,So this place is average. I think the concept is better than their actual execution of Vegan Soul Food. The mac and cheese is good. The greens are hit or miss. For some reason the beans and rice is never seasoned and today the cornbread muffin was a brick. I was disappointed. This is my second visit to the location.
2 star rating,Loved this place. Food was delicious. Service was good. Very chill vibe & prices were reasonable. This will be my go-to when in Detroit.
5 star rating,"I'm going to go back a 100 more times. The Mac and cheese  can't believe it's vegan. I loved the black-eyed pea hummus served w/ pickled beets, olives, and cucumbers. The pita bread was amazingly seasoned. The soul platter is a good choice if you want to taste a couple different things. Those yams =. The smothered tempeh was great just a little salty... But I especially loved the mushroom gravy smothering it. This dish was served with green beans and creamy mashed red potatoes. This entree was enough for leftovers or to share. I can definitely taste the love in the these dishes!"
5 star rating,"I never thought Vegan food could taste so good. Detroit has come a long way. This place is in a great residential neighborhood.  The service was great, and I loved how diverse the place was. Detroit has most definitely changed in the past 10 years."
5 star rating,"Detroit Vegan Soul is a great place for brunch or dinner!  The DVS Breakfast Sandwich is one of my all-time favorite meals, and it is by far the best option in the mornings.  Add a damn fine cup of coffee along with it, and you'll be completely satisfied.  I do wish they offered hash browns or something similar on the side (other than their very small side salad), but maybe that's just the fatty in me.  I've also tried their ""Chicken & Waffles"" option at brunch, but it was a bit dry.As far as lunch or evenings go, you really can't go wrong with a single thing on the menu.  I've tried almost everything, and it's all great.  The staff is nice and it doesn't seem to have much turnover.  It's a small, cafe setting - but not loud at all.  The prices are a bit higher for casual dining, but if they're going to give a vegan that many incredible options, I can handle the bill at the end.  Very cool place."
4 star rating,Was excited to check this place out in the West Village. It really disappointed on a few levels. We went around 2 on a weekday when it wasn't busy. The service was pretty bad for such a small restaurant. They forgot a part of my girlfriends order. Their fryer was broken and therefore half the menu couldn't be ordered. They brought my food out 10 minutes after my girlfriends. The food itself was very mediocre. We probably won't be back.
2 star rating,"My first tofu experience...the catfish tofu wasn't bad at all, although i hit it with some Frank's Red Hot . I'm new to this whole veggie/vegan stuff so keep that in mind. potatoes & broccoli/corn sides were good, a little heavy on the onion for my taste, but good none the less. Hush puppies not so much. Didnt have much taste. Fast & easy online ordering.  I'll be returning."
4 star rating,"Just checked in and found this place in the coolest of areas here in Detroit, abandoned homes, un manicured lawns, closed business but beyond that this business stands out as a beacon of hope for this community.  My coconut Blt was fabulous and sweet potatoes amazing... Good prices good portions.."
5 star rating,I had the pvs burger. And the kale salad. I was only in town for a few so we decided to check this place outThe kale salad smelled real bad. As if its been sitting in a plastic bag for a while and improperly stored. It was really really bad. I was even over charged for the item. I understand that they were busy..but that still not an excuse to serve something that smelled that bad. It was a turn off.The pvs burger was alright. It was on the burnt side but it made up for the salad. Paid over $30 .. Left unsatisfied Try this place on your own. Maybe they just had a bad day. Maybe they were too busy.
3 star rating,"Vegan soul food? Whaaaa? Absolutely. This place is amazing. Vegan, delicious, with yummy gluten free options (try the ""catfish"" & greens...omg). Great food, great friendly people. I took my out of town (non vegan) friends there & they were blown away. Do be prepared for a bit of a wait, though."
5 star rating,"1st of many stops on a vegan food tour, road trip from Illinois. Awesome little restaurant, with amazing bbq tofu. Would love to try the tempeh next time - as it looked seriously delish.  Clean ingredients with fresh produce and a homestyle flair. I was so happy we found this place! Love the brightly coloured interior and pleasant staff. Would love to visit again!"
5 star rating,"First time coming here for brunch, we were quickly seated which was great! But, my friend and I were seated right in front of the window, where the sun was shining so brightly on us and who really wants that on a sunday morning? I suggest that they buy a curtain to put to block out the sun so customers could enjoy eating and talking without the sun in their eyes.After looking around for our waiter (no one came to us even after being seated already for about 10 minutes), I decided to go ahead and walk to a server and tell them nicely that we were ready to order. We were able to switch tables which I was very happy about! I had ordered the vegan biscuits and gravy with the fried chicken and waffles, while my friend had ordered the sweet potato pancakes. The fried chicken weren't good in my opinion, they tasted like tofu siracha and were not crunchy like how ""chicken"" should be. The waffles didn't really taste like much, no flavoring at all. My favorite had to be the biscuits and gravy, yum! I had tasted the sweet potato pancakes and they were heavenly!!  I gave this review a 3 because of the seating in front of the sun (invest in a curtain please!) and bc the chicken and waffles were terrible."
3 star rating,"Amazing! I Iooked this place up while at home in Colorado. I took my parents who aren't vegan and they loved the food. Sunday brunch menu was diverse and tasty. I will come back every time I visit Detroit in the future! Great job, ladies!!"
5 star rating,The SMOTHERED TEMPEH was awesome !! Feels like gradma confort food !! The ceaser salad was very good too !
5 star rating,"I've been eager to come to DVS ever since I heard it was opening. My friend and I were in Detroit so had to take a detour here for dinner. We love the idea of vegan food being more accessible to everyone, including meat eaters, and were not disappointed by what we saw. The menu offers a great selection with options for even the pickiest of eaters. We couldn't stop eating the fried broccoli. The hush puppies were okay, but I preferred their dipping sauce to the actual pups - a little bland. My friend got the BBQ tofu sandwich and I ordered the soul platter. The texture of the tofu on her sandwich was absolutely spectacular. The flavor combo was wonderful. I enjoyed my soul platter for the most part (was so excited to have vegan collard greens). Overall the experience was wonderful. The atmosphere is relaxing and upbeat, the food overall very good. Only complaints were that the service was very very slow and were not checked on often at all. The milkshakes were odd. The strawberry was okay but I did not finish it, and my friend's chocolate/banana tasted sour. Other than the few small complaints, I really loved the experience and the food and will definitely be returning - hopefully to try brunch!"
4 star rating,"It was just ok. I like having an option in the Detroit area but there wasn't anything that was ""good"" satisfying. The place was very clean and the staff members were very polite. Just compared to other restaurants in Michigan including Whole Foods vegan menu the food here was basic"
1 star rating,The portions was way to small and the wait was long. The catfish was breaded tofu and it taste just like breaded tofu. I was not impressed at all
4 star rating,"I tried Detroit Vegan Soul for the 1st time yesterday and it was fantastic. I had the Coconut BLT and I ain't going to lie... if was better than expected. I figured it would be bland and really ""Healthy"" tasting, but it had great flavor and the 2 sides were on jam too. I got the sweet potato chips they were actual fried chips real sweet potatoes baked and delicious along with a little spinach salad. I will make this place a regular go to place for lunch. When the 2nd location opens I will be supporting that one also!! &"
5 star rating,"I thought the food was absolutely delicious. Even though I'm not vegan, I absolutely love vegan food. The restaurant is super cute and on an amazing block in West Village that I never knew existed. I wish the potions were just a bit bigger for the price. I suggest getting anything with coconut bacon!"
4 star rating,I love their bbq tofu sandwiches and their potato salad.Great food
5 star rating,"Great find! The menu is plentiful with so many classic and comfort food options. A few favorites I tried: bbq tofu sandwich, Mac n cheese, and curried potato salad. The decor is contemporary and inviting, but the space itself is small so it's often difficult to be seated right away, especially on busier weekends. Service is also a bit on the slow side. Otherwise great place. I'll definitely be back!"
4 star rating,"My sister and I went to DVS for the first time this afternoon for a quick lunch. She ordered the soul food plate with collards, Mac and cheese, black eyed peas, and cornbread. Since the Mac was made with soy cheese, our waitress gave my sister a sample to make sure she likes it. We both tried it and loved the flavor and texture. It was creamy and tasty. I ordered the smothered tempeh (meatloaf) with mashed red skinned potatoes and green beans. It was delicious!! I didn't even miss the meat (and I LOVE meatloaf)! The tempeh was a bit crunchy, the mushroom gravy was really tasty, and the green beans were really good. I thought the potatoes were a little firm, but still good.We also ordered the peach cobbler with coconut vanilla ice cream. The cobbler was a bit more like bread than an apple crisp, but it was really good as well.We will definitely be back!"
5 star rating,"I went to Detroit for a concert recently and was on the hunt for a good vegan restaurant. By chance I found Detroit Vegan Soul, which only did not disappoint, but turned out to be one of the best vegan resturants I have ever tried. Me and my friends enjoyed it so much we went back the following day on our way home. The first day I got the soul platter which comes with collard greens, candied yams, black eye peas and rice, Mac and cheese and I got a side of catfish tofu. For one holymac and cheese!! Not only is it creamy and dense, it is seasoned  perfectly. All the other vegan Mac and cheese I had at resturants have been somewhat bland not this one I didn't even have to put hot sauce of it. The collard greens were super flavorful as well. The catfish tofu was breaded in corn meal and came with this amazing dill tartar sauce I could probably eat by itself with a spoon.The second day I got a DVS burger and with potatoes and coleslaw. The coleslaw was super creamy and the vegan patty held its shape well not turning in mush and was also very tasty. If you're on Detroit make the trip and go to this place. Vegan or not you I promise you will find something you enjoy!"
5 star rating,"Happened to be in town for football and a concert - had seen DVS featured in a blog, made time to visit, loved it and wish they could open a location in my hometown!Southern Fried Tofu & Waffle was perfect, breakfast sandwich was amazing, sweet potato pancakes were enjoyed by the omni mother in law, it was delicious and everyone left stuffed full and happy. I wish we didn't have to eat and run to get to the Lions game but now I'm scheming on how to get to the other location before I leave town. I'll make the trip back any chance I get!"
5 star rating,"I had the catfish, cheesy grits and spinach. Delicious!! I've never had tofu and this was a great first try. The service was great and attentive. They also have a great tea and smoothie menu. Will be back again!"
5 star rating,"Yummy food last night- Detroit Vegan SoulSouthern Fried Tofu BitesTofu battered and lightly fried, and served with spicy buffalo dipping sauce. (the sauce was amazing and tofu bites so lightly battered did not seem like you were eating ""fried"" food- same with broccoli so lightly battered really tasted the broccoli)Lightly Fried Broccoli with sesame ginger dipping sauceHad to do the gluten free Mac-n-cheese (GF)Kai Lackey had""Catfish"" Tofu (GF)Cornmeal battered tofu, broccoli/corn medley, and redskin potatoes & onions. Tarter sauce was amazing and tofu tasted just like real catfish! The ketchup they use is all tomato and no artificial flavors all real food and was amazing for her potatoes.I was too full but wanted to finish to taste this healthy milk shake could only sip a few sips but REALLY TASTED like the banana splits I used to love as a kid complete with the hersey chocolate syrup taste. Amazing that they can make healthy food taste so authentic and great. I will be trying to find the catsup online to buy for home. Kai and I could only eat about 1/4 of our meal but was so yummy.Even if you are not vegetarian or vegan, I would recommend going here. I am not either but love fresh fruit, vegetables non GMO artificial foods, sugar and want more in my life and LOVED this and it lives up to all- truly went beyond my expectations.The atmosphere was awesome with all nationalities and types of people all harmonious and wait staff wonderful, helpful, patient and kind."
5 star rating,"I was visiting Detroit over the weekend and went to both locations. I had the tofu fish brunch and the tofu fish collard wrap. I love both dishes! I want to learn how to make the cheesy grits, they are so freaking yummy. I had a foodgasm eating here. Please come to Chicago, I love you!"
4 star rating,"Was expecting so much more soulful flavors then what came out to me in bowls and plates.I tried the soul platter with the Mac n cheese, collard greens, corn muffin, black eyed peas and rice, and maple yams, started off with a cup of the okra soup and ended my lunch with the pumpkin cupcake. The collard green was boring and flat and tasted liked boiled collards with no spice or flavoring, the yams tasted too perfumed and overly pungent of incense, the Mac was decent, the corn bread was far too dry and required copious swallows of water to get it down and the black eyed peas continued the spiral of boredom, the okra soup was decent, but could have used a bit more heat and flavoring and the pumpkin cupcake, too was dry, but the frosting was sweet and delicate. The meal was average and left me wanting something more to wipe away the entire boring experience. The vanilla cake with the Careb frosting was decent, mostly the frosting, of course."
3 star rating,"Dine in service is friendly and To go orders are fast. When I first made it into town this was the first location I visited. I got the DVS burger aside salad and red skin potatoes. Everything was wonderful. I came back the next day ordered the same w mushrooms/ onions/ cheese/ and bacon. A side salad redskin potatoes came with it and I ordered a smoothie as well. Man o man it was good. I wish I was in town now, I would get another one. The combination is simply addictive. Next time I'm in town I'm coming here and I'm eating in. Erica was my waitress, she was helpful, nice, and attentive."
5 star rating,"First of all let me start off by saying I am not a vegan, but DAMM THIS FOOD WAS GOOD. Notice the all cap letters. I had the soulfood sampler that had greens, yams,hop-n-john and a cornbread muffin and all of it was tasty. If I had this place close to my living area I could almost become vegan. remember I said ALMOST, GOOD STUFF Detroit Vegan Soul food, my girl and I will most definitely RETURN!!"

5 star rating,"Love this vegan spot! I craveeeee the catfish sandwich. I also love the location, the beautiful restaurant, and the historical references to the city. Every dish I've had is so great, and service is always exceptional."
5 star rating,"This is a cool little place located in a redone area with Detroit homes surrounding it. A friend of mine is Vegan and wanted to try this place out. There were three of us and we all were interested in the Soul Food Platter which is Mac and cheese, tenderly smoked collards garnished with shiitake mushroom, maple glazed yams topped with raisins and pecans, hoppin john (black eyed peas over rice topped with green onion) and a cornbread muffin which is $14. I particularly liked the collard greens which were great even without being cooked with the traditional pork. The muffin was perfectly sweet and one of the best I've had in a while. This was my first time trying hoppin john and I was impressed. I also was interested in the Green Life Smoothie  which is Spinach, kale, pineapple, avocado, dates, and coconut water and costs $7 This was my favorite item that I tried. You could taste the the greens first with a pineapple coconut finish. I'd come back here just for this."
4 star rating,"I never thought Vegan food could taste so good. Detroit has come a long way. This place is in a great residential neighborhood.  The service was great, and I loved how diverse the place was. Detroit has most definitely changed in the past 10 years."
5 star rating,"This is a beautifully appointed restaurant in Detroit's West Village. I'm not vegetarian, but I am gluten free, and they have an extensive gluten free menu. Sadly, they recently made the Mac and cheese not gluten free. It was so delicious, and I'm sad. Today I had the catfish sandwich, which comes with a tiny side of cole slaw or spinach salad, and redskin potatoes or yams. The catfish is delicious, especially because of the dill sauce. It's served on either a regular or gluten free bun. My friend had the barbecue tofu sandwich, which she had last time as well. She loves the barbecue sauce, and the cole slaw on the sandwich. We also had the roibus punch, which was very sweet. We got the milkshake for dessert-the banana split-though we got it without the banana. It was very tasty, and I'd get it again, though it's pricy at I eight dollars. We also got a side of the candied yams, which are wonderful. I had gotten the soul platter last time, which was good, but I thought the sandwich was a better value. I wasn't a fan of the black eyed peas, because I like mine more vinegary, but a lot of people live them. I can't wait to try more of their options!"
5 star rating,"Detroit Vegan Soul is a great place to eat in Detroit, for both the die hard Vegan, and the die hard Carnivore. As someone who used to be insistent on having meat with every meal, this restaurant was pretty eye opening as to how good food can be, even without meat! They've got a pretty solid selection of dishes, and there's generally something for everyone. Many of the dishes are twists on meat-based or meat-centered dishes you'd normally see, but they taste fantastic and don't try to trick you into thinking they are meat. The one downside of the restaurant is that it is pretty small inside, so if you are trying to have any remotely large group (4+), I'd say look somewhere else, as either there won't be enough space or you'll be waiting quite a while for a table. However if you have a small group, it's a very nice and cozy atmosphere and the dishes prepared are very ""instagrammable"". Keto/ Low Carb folks: You might want to look for another spot to eat, as substitutes for meat can be on the carb-heavy side, the restaurant is dairy/egg/lactose free, and the sandwiches/ burgers aren't an option."
4 star rating,"The food is good but the service in the afternoon is generally pretty bad. Today I called in to place a carry-out order, but I was immediately put on hold for an unacceptable amount of time. I disconnected and called back only to get a busy signal for the next 10-15 minutes. When I showed up there we're at least 8 employees doing literally nothing and only a single other customer. I told them about the phone. The response was ""oh yeah, there was a phone call"". Great.The young lady behind the counter needs to up her customer service game as well. Not a single thank you or please come again. This seems to be a symptom of Detroit in general, as a great many service workers I've encountered seem to suffer from an inability to even pretend be pleasant.So I did eventually get my food, a full 40 minutes after my initial call, but the experience left me sour.Such a shame for a place with decent food to mar their image with sub-par service. My guess is the pool of available workers with the right stuff is quite small. I'll probably give them another chance though."

4 star rating,"I am absolutely in love with the smothered tempeh. Three pieces of tempeh covered in mushroom gravy, smashed garlic potatoes on the side and topped with green beans cooked to perfection, fresh green onions and sliced almonds. The mushroom gravy is incredibly flavorful. The green beans are crisp and tender. I cannot wait to go back and sample more! The restaurant had a casual vibe and was perfect for an intimate dinner catching up with my friend. I'm salivating while reminiscing on this delightful dish!"
5 star rating,"Very slow service. Allow 2 hours to order, be served and eat if you're dining here at lunchtime. Some of the items were interesting. They could have used some spice."
3 star rating,I had the pvs burger. And the kale salad. I was only in town for a few so we decided to check this place outThe kale salad smelled real bad. As if its been sitting in a plastic bag for a while and improperly stored. It was really really bad. I was even over charged for the item. I understand that they were busy..but that still not an excuse to serve something that smelled that bad. It was a turn off.The pvs burger was alright. It was on the burnt side but it made up for the salad. Paid over $30 .. Left unsatisfied Try this place on your own. Maybe they just had a bad day. Maybe they were too busy.
3 star rating,The only thing that has flavor is the peach cobbler that isn't always available & the Caesar salad. The tofu bites aren't bad but they're over priced. I really want to love this place but it taste like white ppls version of souless soul food. Vegan food should not be bland because it's healthy. 2 stars for the two good menu options I've tried out of them all. Oh & if you order carry out please check your bag before you leave. They've only NOT forgotten something once.
2 star rating,"Over the past three years I have enjoyed coming to Detroit Vegan Soul. Their menu is consistent and predictable, the space is nice and cozy, the food is comforting, the service is good. Some of my favorite dishes are the seitan pepper steak, smothered tempeh, DVS burger, catfish tofu, and BBQ tofu. Also, their sesame broccoli is fantastic. I would definitely recommend Detroit Vegan Soul to vegans and non vegans. I am giving it only four stars because I have noticed a decline in the quality of the food, the service, and the overall experience over the past few months. I have not enjoyed the food quite as much as I used to the last few times I was in. Also, I wish they would close just a bit later, 8pm is early."
4 star rating,I have been on a quest to try the vegan diet. My first step was eating here at DVS. I ordered a BBQ tofu sandwich and it was delicious. I will be back to try the other meals on the menu. Very good sandwich and the environment was relaxed and positive. Looking for vegan menu try this place asap!
5 star rating,"Well, I took the plunge. We live in close proximity to Vegan Soul and my vegetarian wife has been after me to try it since it opened, and I must admit, having walked by the (rear) kitchen door scores of times w/my dog, it usually smells very good. Oh, one more thing about me - I more-or-less went along w/my wife's conversion to vegetarianism, although I still eat fish, turkey and every so often, a little chicken (kind of pescetarian / vegetarian lite). I've also heard neighbors rave about this place (which admittedly makes me suspicious), and the (allegedly) faaabulous Mac & cheese.  OK, so much for the disclosures.I had the Mac & cheese, corn & broccoli, and cole slaw (3 sides); my wife had the tofu catfish, polenta grits & spinach. $22 for fairly meager portions (like a small-to-medium size ice cream scoop, except the 3-4 Dorito chip size pieces of 'catfish'). The coleslaw was ok - maybe in competition w/Kroger or your basic Spartan store deli, (I'd give Kroger the edge); the broccoli & corn fresh - not overly done - crisp & flavorful, but it's broccoli & corn, not a signature dish from a CIA (the one in New York, not Washington DC) trained chef. Then we have the reputedly brilliant Mac & cheese. Mmmm no.  I had a vision of an I love Lucy episode (with the facial expressions as only Lucille Ball could do) in which Lucy's eating some celebrity chef's Mac & cheese, but the cheese was inadvertently omitted, with a mash up of cumin & turmeric & curry - maybe a hint of bay seasoning - substituted in its place. And the ""Mac"" part . . . Hmmm, if you put antique fire hoses (the one with the canvass-like covering) in a food processor & tried to form it into macaroni-like kibble, perhaps stirring in some Elmers wood glue for color & texture, then baking the mush/slurry until it appears to be developing a crust (or the rubber from the hose starts to brown) I believe you'd have a remarkable approximation of this 'signature' dish. Kraft  (or even the Meijer store brand I used to try to fool my kids with) -you have nothing to worry about.The spinach & grits - well, I observed that my wife ate with a noteworthy lack of enthusiasm (and she started the meal with the kind of ""Try new things - you're going to LIKE this can-do happytude""). When she - or anyone else - starts a meal at 8.5-9 on the enthusiasm scale, and finishes at about 3.5, it pretty well sums things up. Oh, and the faux catfish? Kind of like twice-refried fish nugget pieces at a disreputable long John silvers (in fairness to long John silvers, I remember them from my teenage years, and they were definitely better than the vegan version). Our dog a bite of one, and I didn't even note any particular enthusiasm from him (and there's a reason he's nicknamed the 'snack king' at the dog park).So there you have it.  A vegan acquaintance of ours might like it, but she equates consuming a burger to murder (I'm not making this up), and her significant other consuming eggs & dairy products to rape, so go figure.Perhaps for hardcore vegans who thrive on this stuff, I say more power to you (and suggest regular multivitamins). For the rest of rational society - including vegetarians - I say believe me, skip Detroit Vegan Soul, you won't have missed anything,"
1 star rating,I love their bbq tofu sandwiches and their potato salad.Great food
5 star rating,"My first tofu experience...the catfish tofu wasn't bad at all, although i hit it with some Frank's Red Hot . I'm new to this whole veggie/vegan stuff so keep that in mind. potatoes & broccoli/corn sides were good, a little heavy on the onion for my taste, but good none the less. Hush puppies not so much. Didnt have much taste. Fast & easy online ordering.  I'll be returning."

5 star rating,"Caring for my grandparents has me in the Detroit area every few months and one thing I look forward to most is driving from Belleville (where they live) to enjoy a meal at DVS. The food is good and until yesterday, the service has always been on point. This past weekend, I returned to town with my husband and we were both excited about having lunch at DVS. Being a Saturday, it was busy but not terribly so. We were seated after about a 15-minute wait. At the same time, a group was seated next to us and we noticed some other tables opening up. Guests were led to those tables shortly thereafter (the timing of these seatings is important later). When our server came over, she seemed friendly and introduced herself by name (unfortunately I've forgotten it, but she is a young black woman--maybe early 20s--with very long, curly weave and long fingernails. The description is relevant since I can't recall her name). We said hello and asked how she was doing. She said, ""Fine. Thanks for asking."" And that is the end of anything pleasant about our interaction with her. For my drink order, I asked if I could have one of the shakes without anything in it except the vanilla coconut milk ice cream and almond milk. Blank stare from the server. ""I don't like shakes with a lot of stuff in it,"" I explained, ""so I was wondering if they could just do a vanilla shake instead?"" She said she didn't know what I meant. I repeated myself, ""The shakes on the menu have vanilla ice cream and almond milk in them, right? So, I was wondering if they could just do those two ingredients instead of adding all of the other ingredients to make it a 'flavor,'"" Visibly exasperated, she said, ""I don't understand what you're asking for."" I asked her if she'd ever had a vanilla shake. She said ""Yes, but I don't think they can do that here."" I asked if she would mind asking the kitchen staff just to be sure. (I neglected to mention that I have had a vanilla shake there before, whether it was on the menu or they just made it for me, I don't recall). At this point she snapped and said something like, ""This isn't a diner. They can't just make shakes."" Put off by her attitude, I told her never mind about the shake and I would stick to water. A bottle of water was already on the table so I asked for glasses. My husband ordered a smoothie from the menu. She said she'd bring the glasses and walked to the counter where I could see her talking to one of her co-workers, who we found out later was the supervisor, Breana. The server gestured over to our table. It was not difficult to conclude she was telling Breana about us. She never brought the glasses. In fact, she never returned to our table.After waiting about 10 minutes, my husband got up to ask the hostess for the glasses. When he sat back down, we watched our server take orders from the table next to us, then walk to several other tables, all of them seated after us, to take their orders. She never looked at our table and in fact, seemed to be deliberately averting her gaze to avoid us. She ignored us for several more minutes before my husband finally went over to the counter to explain that we were having a difficult time getting her to serve us. He asked if we could perhaps get another server. The woman he spoke with (Breana, the supervisor--although she did not introduce herself as such or make apologies for our inconvenience at that time) said the server would be over soon and explained that the restaurant was busy and it may take longer. He told her our server seemed to have an issue with us after we'd tried to order a shake and seemed to be ignoring us. Breana denied this and gave the excuse that she was the only server. She also said our server was taking orders in the order of seating. My husband pointed out that we had been seated before some of the other tables that she'd already served.In the end, someone else came over and took our order. A different person brought it to us. Our original server never returned. Breana came over later and asked us how our experience was. I told her what happened, and stated that all our server had to do from the beginning was say, ""I'll check with the kitchen"" or ""No, they can't make a plain shake."" All the rest, including her attitude and snarky ""This isn't a diner"" was unacceptable. Breana made more excuses for the server, saying ""she doesn't know that kind of behavior to be a part of her demeanor."" She then gave us a complimentary card to return (which we won't as long as that server is employed there).Here's the clincher. The tables are VERY close together. So when our ""server"" was saying goodbye to the people seated to our right, she told them, ""You guys have been a breath of fresh air."" She then said something under her breath and nodded over to our table. One of the guests even looked over at me. This was AFTER Breana had made all the apologies and excuses for this server's unprofessional behavior.Sorry, DVS. You've lost these vegans."
1 star rating,"Clean, healthy food. Excellent service. I'll definitely be back! I had the Soul Plate. I'm thinking I might set a goal of working through the menu."
4 star rating,5 stars for the tasty salad and soup I had tonight. Making vegan taste soooo good! A must try if you are into whole foods and clean eating:)
5 star rating,An excellent version a vegan soul and a place where non-vegans will also be happy. Loved it!
5 star rating,"Went here last summer for lunch, and remembered whatever sandwich wrap I had was exceptionally good with a nice side salad of greens.   It was a 5 Star lunch.  So tonight I went for dinner, and our meals were disappointing.   The seitan stir fry was good, except the brown rice was unrecognizable, like goo, and the side of broccoli wasn't fresh but frozen.  My lemonaid tasted like Country Time mix---even though the server said it's made fresh.   She kindly replaced it with sweet tea, but it wasn't the best iced tea either.   The Caesar salad dressing was tasty, but it was on the side and the salad itself looked forlorn.   I wonder if this was an off night but I won't be back for dinner but I'd still go for lunch."
3 star rating,"Catfish tofu was the prefect summer afternoon meal. Light, well seasoned and topped off with a tall glass of lemonade!"
5 star rating,"The food is outstanding, but the portions are too small for the cost. Also, the service leaves much to be desired. Came in on a Saturday, and was greeted by 3 different servers before being placed on a waitlist and told it would be 20 minutes... this was after we had already been standing there for 10 minutes and were told it would just be a few minutes. When we were finally seated we weren't given menus, the food took too long to come out, and the waitress took other orders before bringing us things like salt and pepper. It's a shame because the food is really great, but the service really took away from the experience."
3 star rating,Best vegan food in Detroit. Went 2 days in a row. Got smothered tempeh both days it was soooo good!
5 star rating,"Awesome. We tried the black-eyed pea hummus, the smothered tempeh, BBQ tofu, mac-n-cheese, and sesame broccoli. All of it was absolutely delicious and the portion size was great for the price. Left feeling full but not gross. The BBQ sauce is very sweet, but I mixed in some Sriracha and it was great. (That's a personal taste thing though, not a complaint.) The mushroom gravy was rich, the hummus was nicely smoky, and the sesame broccoli was salty and earthy. Also, our server, Morgan, was super friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. All around great experience."
4 star rating,"OMG.... My grandson & his girlfriend treated me to a meal at Detroit Vegan Soul, East Restaurant. They have a East & West Vegan Soul. This was my first time eating there, and I must say the food was ""Delicious"" I tried the Vegan platter with collard greens, mac & cheese, sweet potatoes, black eyed peas & rice with a cornbread muffin & real lemonade as the drink. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because there is no parking lot. It was a problem trying to get in & out of the car on a small busy street with parking on both sides. Other than that I enjoyed my visit to Detroit Vegan Soul, plus I had enough food to take back home for later.  I can add this to my list of favorite places to eat."
4 star rating,The wait time was 30 mins but that was ok! Now The food was good I had the smothered temphe with tofu bbq and the mac and cheese. I liked all of the sides oh and also I had the carrot cake which was very moist and good. The catfish tofu was ok due to it was a bit on the salty side. All together I loved the environment and it was a great experience.
4 star rating,"What a delicious spot! Location/Atmosphere: 5/5. DVS is located on a truly charming street by the Historic Indian Village. The inside is casual, comfortable, and well lit. We went in for lunch and it was pretty busy. Service: 5/5. We received prompt and kind service! Also we had a couple of special requests, and the waitress must have communicated them well because there were no mistakes. Food: 5/5. We had the fried tofu wrap and the burger, with cole slaw and redskin potatoes. We both loved our entrees! I particularly loved the burger--it was deliciously seasoned and had a lovely texture. I'd never had a millet-veggie burger before and I'm so glad I tried this one. The redskin potatoes and cole slaw were delicious, as well! Overall: So glad we went here, this will probably turn into one of my new favorite spots!"
5 star rating,"WARNING: FOOD POISONING AND CROSS-CONTAMINATION. Also, bad customer service and they don't seem to care about their customers well being after getting sick. Here's the long story:I had an allergic reaction to my milkshake here. Let me preface this by mentioning that the menu does state that there is a chance of cross contamination, but I received a verbal ""GUARANTEE"" that there would be absolutely zero traces of the thing I am allergic to. I only had a sip and the actual ingredient definitely wasn't in there (or else I would've needed my Epi-Pen) and could immediately tell I was having a reaction. I acted quick enough with a pill to counteract what had just happened, and this is where I start critiquing the restaurant. The customer service was BAD. Our waitress was sweet, but once it looked like I had a problem she avoided me like the plague. My boyfriend had to call her over because we wanted to let her know that there must have been a cross contamination of some sort so that nobody else with my allergy experiences the same thing. I almost felt like they didn't believe me even though I had my pills and my Epi-Pen right there. The manager (I think) came up to us afterwards and didn't offer to call an ambulance or even offer our money back for just that item. I politely asked if they could take it off of the bill (because it's a pricey place) and they would only partially take money off. She continued doing other things and what seemed to be just killing time so she didn't have to refund us the few dollars that was offered so we just left. I'm so sick right now. My boyfriend doesn't have any allergies and he feels sick too. I don't know exactly what is up with this place but I would save your time and money and go elsewhere. There are plenty of other great places around that serve amazing vegan food. Sadly I doubt that they will read this or care about what happened."
1 star rating,"The good is completely amazing! The service however is terrible, I've only been here twice both experiences were not pleasant. My order was wrong the first time and it took a while to get my food so I didn't want to start again. The second time I spoke with a manager name Bri, she was very rude. I asked if I could substitute a side for another one due to the fact that they are all the same price, she disregarded my question as if personally offended. It was just so rude and unnecessary so I won't be back. A the food is too expensive for shitty service"
2 star rating,"Had lunch there 8/30/18. I am not vegan, just trying to eat better. Had the kale saled. Delicious, really nice dressing. Entree was the fake pepper steak over brown rice. Can't tell you what the veggie protein was,  but it was prepared fantastically mixed with the peppers and onions.Bill was $25. Not cheap, but worth it. I guess I'm forced to eat healthy the rest of day.  No washing this down with pizza for dinner. Restaurant was nestled in a neighborhood that is still holding up nicely. Check it out."
5 star rating,"Let me just say I am SO pleased that I was able to visit this gem of Detroit! I was in town for a conference and was able to swing by for Sunday brunch. Boy was it worth it! The soul platter was amazing and the tofu and waffles looked mouth watering! Heads up that the dining area is a little small so it can't accommodate parties of more than 6.Vegan ""soul"" food is rare to find. Give this place a try. You won't regret it!Read my full review here: veganhostess.com/2015/04…"
5 star rating,"Ok we're such vegan foodies that imagining soul food from Detroit became an obsession/ dream realized, we had to take a road trip just to taste! Lovely adventure, beautiful souls serving  and we loved it! Yummers!!!"
5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite vegetarian restaurants I've ever been to thus far. They have something no one else has. Soul food, vegan soul food. The restaurant is clean and in a nice spot. I can't wait to come back here. Their Mac and cheese is so amazing."
5 star rating,"I will no longer eat here and that's sad because it was a great place when I first came to the restaurant. I'm the customer and if I want the Southern Tofu Bites, which are appetizers, then that what I should get what I want. Why do I need to be told, ""No you can't order it till it's a certain time."" like I'm a child. That's not right. I'm in the service industry and we are taught to give customers what they want. Sorry DVS you've lost a customer and I will be informing others that how you operate your menu :)"
4 star rating,"Came here later in the evening in late January with my boyfriend.  Neither of us are vegan but I'd been buggin to try this place for a while and my boyfriend ""owed me one"" so I got to pick.  The place is kind of tiny but cute.  We were immediately seated and our server instantly came to take our order.  I asked for a few minutes to look over the menu and for a glass of water.  It took a while, but our server came back and took our order - no water though, which I reminded her.  A little while later, our fried broccoli arrived (via another server) and I noticed our server chatting it up with another table so finally I just flagged down someone else and asked if I could have a water.  She then waited to get my server to get my water... really kind of annoying.  I was ready to go behind the counter and pour it myself.  So water crisis aside, our food came out pretty much right after.  I had the BBQ tofu and my boyfriend had the Cesar Chavez salad.  I really liked my entrée.  Tofu isn't something I eat a lot of and I never thought about pairing it with bbq but it works.  The kale I did not have high hopes for as cooked kale rarely interests me but it was delicious with a nice ""pot liquor"" you'd expect from a bowl of home made collard greens.  The corn and potato salad were also very good.  I feel the portion was fairly small, but the price point is low and perhaps it was just that good I wanted more.  However, while I was devouring my food, my boyfriend tried his salad and did NOT like the house made ""Cesar"" dressing it was served with.  I kind of brushed it off and told him ""It's a salad, can you really screw it up?"" but eventually tried the dressing and, yeah, I don't know if it was supposed to taste like that but it had a gross (almost chemical) aftertaste.  It threw the salad off.  Easy fix with a new dressing right?  Well, only if you have a server that isn't more worried about chatting with everyone else.  We went the entire time of me consuming my meal without being able to flag her down.  We were over it at that point because getting a new salad (or just new dressing) would have had me just sitting there without food but we did tell our server when she returned.  She did get him a different dressing to take with, but honestly it was too late for that... would have been nice to have had service who felt it was not an inconvenience to check on her customers.   After we asked for the bill I remember waiting around for the server to be able to ring us out or print our bill or something of that nature... just a lot of waiting... kind of annoying and made me question if he should have just tried to eat the salad afterall.  So in short, food is delicious (except that weird dressing...might have been an off-day).Price point, perfect.Atmosphere - cuteAnd I love the whole concept (plus it gives my food-obsessed self the ability to impress my vegetarian friend who won't take part in most of my endeavors) But I felt we spent so much time WAITING for simple service basics it knocked my experience down to just ""meh"".  The worst thing a business can do is make a customer feel like they aren't very important to them.  I do plan to return at least once more before I pawn this place off as a carry-out-only joint."
3 star rating,The food was delicious! I got the smothered tempeh with green beans and potatoes! The flavor was everything! I also had the hibiscus punch! It was delicious! The prices are reasonable and I'm leaving feeling happy and healthy!
5 star rating,"Omg, awesomeness the location and atmospheres was great, Morgan our hostess with the mostess was charming. We tried almost everything on the menu and may I say everything was delicious! Catfish Tofu, what, yes it was delectable, mind blowing delicious. Then there was dessert pumpkin spice cup cake wonderful, Apple crisp cobbler with ice cream heartwarming then there was peach cobbler and ice cream that made my eyes roll to the back of my head and export me to my grandmother's front porch on a warm summer day, the peach cobbler was outstanding! I will return!!!"
5 star rating,The tomato basil soup with the hoppin john is amazing! Mix it together and you've got vegan goulash....yummy!
4 star rating,"Even if your not cool, you will feel cool for eating here. Nice atmosphere, as if your in some hipster paradise. Food is prepared with love and thought, from the soul food stuff spring rolls filled with greens to the tofu catfish and grits. This place is a hidden gem, this review coming from someone who loves meat."
4 star rating,"We love Detroit Vegan Soul! They have excellent food! We always enjoy whatever we order here. As a vegetarian, it's always nice to find a place where you can get great food and have many options, instead of just a veggie burger. I would definitely recommend Detroit Vegan Soul!"
5 star rating,"I wasn't vegan when I first went there nor were any of the people I went with but we all loved it and have been back multiple times. I am now vegan an can say it is one of the best vegan places I've been to. Try the carrot cake - oh heck, try everything, nothing disappoints."
5 star rating,"Sometimes vegan food tries to imitate animal products and fails. This place doesn't. Amazing flavor that more than resembles the flavors of cheeses and meats. I am a vegan and don't like eating imitation food often, but this place is a nice treat. Portion sizes are nearly perfect and the prices are fair. Give this place a chance if you miss the taste of animal products and just want some good 'ole soul food."
4 star rating,Suprised that the city of Detroit has such an incredible vegetarian restaurant.Very cozy and comforting.Friendly service and affordable pricing.Whenever I am in the city for work Id definitely make a stop there.
5 star rating,"totally underwhelmed by this place. i've been wanting to try it for a long time since it opened and finally got a chance to come here with one vegan friend and one omnivore friend. i think we all kind of felt the same way about it.the coffee is cheap and good so it's got that going for it. i also tried the china cola, which was just like coke but without the caffeine (lame, but my own fault for wanting to try it).we started with the collard spring rolls, which were okay. they tasted exactly like they sound like they would taste. just crispy spring roll shell filled with collard greens. came with a sauce to dip but i don't really remember it.i had a brunch plate which was the tofu catfish, cheesy grits, and some cooked spinach. the greens were really salty and i didn't really like them. the grits were awful. they would have been much better if they didn't try to be cheesy. i asked the waitress what made them cheesy if they were vegan. she said it was soy cheese, so i gave it a shot, but it tasted just like daiya, which i can't stand, so i regretted that immediately. the catfish was really good! it was a little on the dry side, but i thought the flavor was really good. it did really taste like catfish or at least some kind of fried fish.i also had a bite of sweet potato pancakes. in the last two years, i've developed a terrible aversion to anything sweet potato, but i'm always trying to learn to re-like it. i'm pleased to report these cakes weren't too yammy and i could handle them okay.the space is really small but it doesn't feel cramped and there's plenty of street parking. the staff here are really nice. our waitress was nice and later i asked someone for directions to a liquor store and they were super helpful too.i think i'd not want to come back just because this is the second time i've been to a vegetarian soul food place, and while i'm always looking for good vegan cuisine, i don't think this particular type of food really lends itself well to being vegan. plus outside of the some of the brunch things, i think it's really pricey for how much i'd like it. i can see this place working for some people but it wasn't for me."
4 star rating,Love Love Love this place. The catfish is amazing!!  Just remember the food is made to order so if you are in a rush order ahead.
5 star rating,"Great food, great place. Flavors were wonderful. I introduced my to older sisters to a vegan experience and they have a new view on what eating vegan is all about and how good the food can taste."
5 star rating,"Drove across town to experience a vegan soul food restaurant I heard about. Arrived at 7:35p. There closing time was 8:00pm. A couple walked in behind us and and an employee waved them over and immediately seated them. The employee then walked up and stated that they had stopped seating people. When asked why the couple that came in after us was seated, he stated that they had been on a waiting list earlier. Now......when we arrived, there was no one waiting. I'm not sure what waiting list he was referring to. But, I will not waste my time, driving across town again to be told I will not be seated 30 minutes before closing. I will also make sure other potential patrons understand how they might be treated. If the closing time is 7:30, that should be CLEARLY stated on their website and on Yelp."
1 star rating,Delicious!! Sweet space and friendly wait staff. Cleaned our plates and wished we had had room for a piece of snickerdoodle cake. Five stars!
5 star rating,"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would! I loved everything about this place. From the moment you walk in, you know that this is not your average restaurant. I tell people that it's vegan by default, not by design. If you have convinced yourself that vegan food is not good, with no good flavor, you owe it to yourself to eat here with an open mind. Most items on the menu, taste as good or better than their animal filled counterparts. I was in The D. with friends for a birthday celebration and tried this place with the group. I was the only vegan and all but one in the group, found everything to be very flavorful. I will be making a trip back to The D. in the fall for a long weekend, just to try this place again. Not only did I have the most awesome server, but the owner came to our table to welcome us, once she found out that we were from out of town! I can't recommend this place enough.If you can, ask for Ryla's table, as she will take great care of you. Enjoy!"
5 star rating,"My experience here was awesome. Wasn't what I expected because it exceeded my expectations. I had the ""pepper steak and rice"" and it was awesome. We'll be back soon"
5 star rating,"Where do I begin? I guess I'll start with the fact it took one hour for our food to come out. We walked into the restaurant at 7:23pm and our food came out at 8:35. Now I'll be honest, I can overlook the fact that the food took FOREVER to come out but this place had the NERVE to serve the most insipid, lifeless soul food I've ever tasted in my life. I ordered the soul platter with tofu catfish, which consisted of macaroni, ""candied"" yams, collard greens, a corn muffin, black eyed peas, and the aforementioned tofu catfish. The black eyed peas had absolutely no flavor, and I had to smother in hot sauce just to taste anything. The ""candied"" yams consisted of sliced sweet potatoes which 5 specks of cinnamon on them. I will however give credit when credit is due as the tofu catfish was cool. It was breaded well and tasted all right, but the rest of the bland sides took away from the catfish's spotlight. This place gives vegan food a bad name and should honestly think about revamping their menu and flavors. Idk man but this ain't it ! . So if you haven't gotten the pith of this review, I'll be explicitly clear. Stay away if you enjoy flavor, salt, and happiness."
2 star rating,One of the best vegan places I have ever been to and I'm not a regular vegan eater. Spaghetti with meatballs and lemon pound cake was amazing. Service was great and had a great experience overall.
5 star rating,Friendly staff and delicious food. My guest thought we needed to go to Wendy's afterwards but nope. My guest  is happy with a full stomach.
5 star rating,"I literally couldn't stop saying ""omg"" as I was eating! My friend and I shared our meal. We split the Cesar Chavez Salad, the ""Catfish"" Tofu Fillet Sandwich and the Smothered Tempeh that's covered in mushroom gravy with mashed redskins and green beans. We also had a side of Candied Yams and Black Eyed Peas and Rice. For dessert we got a red velvet cupcake. Everything was unbelievably delicious!! It was my first time there and I will definitely be back! Probably sooner than later because I'll be having dreams about that ""catfish"" sandwich. The restaurant itself is very cozy, very clean and simplistically decorated. There were only two tables and some bar seats available when we got there at 8pm on a Saturday night. Our waitress was very nice! All in all a great experience!"
4 star rating,"This is a beautifully appointed restaurant in Detroit's West Village. I'm not vegetarian, but I am gluten free, and they have an extensive gluten free menu. Sadly, they recently made the Mac and cheese not gluten free. It was so delicious, and I'm sad. Today I had the catfish sandwich, which comes with a tiny side of cole slaw or spinach salad, and redskin potatoes or yams. The catfish is delicious, especially because of the dill sauce. It's served on either a regular or gluten free bun. My friend had the barbecue tofu sandwich, which she had last time as well. She loves the barbecue sauce, and the cole slaw on the sandwich. We also had the roibus punch, which was very sweet. We got the milkshake for dessert-the banana split-though we got it without the banana. It was very tasty, and I'd get it again, though it's pricy at I eight dollars. We also got a side of the candied yams, which are wonderful. I had gotten the soul platter last time, which was good, but I thought the sandwich was a better value. I wasn't a fan of the black eyed peas, because I like mine more vinegary, but a lot of people live them. I can't wait to try more of their options!"
5 star rating,"Not my favorite vegan place, but was very pleased to find somewhere to eat as I was visiting from out of town. The flavor of the food was a bit underwhelming, and some of it was undercooked (sesame broccoli next to raw, strawberry cobbler was sort of like jello in texture, macaroni noddles were waaaay past al dente and fries were soggy). I had the pepper steak, and it was a tad too salty and soggy.  However, the hush puppies weren't bad, and the southern fried tofu bites were really tasty!"
3 star rating,"Came here because Los Angeles has a vegan soul place, and I wanted to compare. Good, simple, clean vegan food. Plates are reasonably priced at $9 and it was flavorful and significant enough to satiate meat eaters. The choices are limited for Sunday brunch, so be aware. Service is prompt and polite."
4 star rating,"I waited to review, after my first three experiences at DVS within a month of them opening their store front. So, I went back after a long time away certain that one major thing would be fixed...Overall, DVS is ""meh."" The food is fine, but the kitchen is unbelievably slow. I thought that was adjusting to line cooks or something in their new space, but as they have been established in this space for awhile, I'll just accept that this is an extremely slow back of the house.  Also, previously, the portions were very small, as in, I left hungry! That's wild because I assure you every time I dine out, I have leftovers. One last thing. We got chicken and waffles for brunch.  Waited half an hour (we were the first people in the restaurant that morning) and when we got our plates I almost laughed out loud because those waffles were straight up from a box of van's frozen waffles!!!  If you don't have a waffle iron, take the waffles off your menu?  Store bought waffles is tacky. I've been vegan for 15 years and the food is tasty, but it's not worth the wait and price."
3 star rating,Vegan soul food done right! I was visiting Detroit and just had one chance to try it all so the server recommended the soul food platter with a side of catfish tofu and I'm so glad I went with the recommendation! We also tried the DVS breakfast sandwich and it was just as delicious. There's no going wrong here! Wish we had something like this closer to home!
5 star rating,I ordered the DVS and I'm highly satisfied. It was so amazing. I would also recommend the tropical breeze smoothie with almond milk.
5 star rating,"On Saturday June 2nd...Went to Detroit Vegan Soulfood for dinner  and it was NOT what they used to be! I know those greens had canned mixed in them if not all canned they were salty as heck! Sweet potatoes had a canned texture, corn muffin was a rock! The lemons for my husband's  water were old..The appetizers ...Fried broccoli a lil heavy in oil but good and black eye pea hummus was great and the presentation was beautiful.., the mac n cheese in the soul food platter was good again, and one lemonade.. which was good but 70 bucks??  Maybe the rent in the new trendy area went up..They had a whole lot of people working .. 4 in the kitchen, a guy at the counter running his mouth, a bus girl with an attitude, a waitress who was working really hard, somebody Auntie hostess who seemed confused and the food was slow to come out ..It was pretty busy with a diverse crowd which I enjoy.The menu has not changed and I know they have a second location now but there is a point when growth exceeds capacity and process needs to change.. quality and service suffer and then the beginning of the end becomes a threat... I hate to see this!!"
3 star rating,"D.V.S had me speechless.  I wanted to not only eat vegan, but I wanted no added oil and I wanted something authentic.  Tall order for my first time there and I wasn't prepared to have my mind completely blown.  Almost all of their sides have no added oil and they have a special of four sides for $9 ($4 each).  By just ordering only sides I could get three plate-fulls of greens, coleslaw, mashed potatoes with gravy, beans and rice and they steamed me some broccoli with sesame seeds.  I was able to eat as much as I wanted without feeling bloated, with no food coma and everything tasted totally authentic and I couldn't believe -- no oil.  All this clean eating, I added two of the moistest cornbread muffins I've ever had.  D.V.S. Is soul foods answer to Gracias Madre (West Hollywood) for Mexican vegan food.  It was my last stop on my trip to the D -- next time it will be my first."
5 star rating,"I ordered the platter with black eyed peas mac n cheese, yams, collards and cornbread.  The mac was really good.  Probably the best vegan mac n cheese I've had.  However everything else was really bad.  Nothing else on the platter tasted good at all.  I can count on one hand how many times I have sent food back at a restaurant.  This was one of those times.  I sent it back and ordered the vegan burger with fries.  That was amazing.  I would actually go back and order that again. The vegan ranch with my salad was great too.  So I guess soul food isn't their strength but their sandwiches are really good."
3 star rating,"The reviews heightened expectations that the food here is outstanding. Well from what I experienced it isn't.  The Soul Plate was ordered with black eyed peas that were unseasoned, collard greens that were overlooked and the consistency of wilted noodles, one of the driest and hardest corn muffins, and an macaroni and cheese that had a gritty consistency and odd smoked flavor.  The one redeeming menu item is the catfish tofu.  Well done and the only properly seasoned item. This food didn't taste fresh and I fear the greens were indeed canned.  An overall waste of time venturing out of the downtown core."
4 star rating,"DVS doesn't spend time trying to satisfy every taste bud. They focus on doing one thing, and doing it right. I ordered the Soul Food Platter, and loved every item on the plate. The cornbread was sweet, the mac & cheese was bold, the greens were smokey, and the yams were soft and sweet. The best cornbread I've ever had, including the non-vegan kind. If you're looking for a simple vegan meal that will stick to your ribs and fill you up quick, this is the place for it. The owners really care about what they do, and the food shows it.Side note: OMG VEGAN CHEESECAKE."
4 star rating,"As a longtime vegan (going on twenty years), I was really excited to try this place. Unfortunately, it was pretty disappointing. It's possible I just caught it on a bad day, but the mac & cheese was inedibly salty (the server did kindly take it off the bill). The collards had somewhat better flavor but hadn't been properly washed, so every bite was full of dirt crunch. The sandwiches were definitely better (we tried the BBQ tofu and the tofu fish), but neither was transformative and the bun was mediocre at best. The menu itself is a bit disappointing to me, too. First, it strikes me as surprisingly limited. Second, I think it would be make much more sense to choose sides with the main to make a platter. As it is, it seemed weird that the sandwiches come only with your choice of (not very good) potato and slaw/salad, with the soul food sides sold separately à la carte. Quickly adds up to a pretty expensive lunch. As a point of comparison, I had recently been to NuVegan in D.C. and, for me, DVS isn't anywhere close to being in the same league, either in its menu or its execution."
2 star rating,"Second time coming. My first visit food was just ok, so I figured I'll give them another try, because maybe it was just what I ordered. Well I had to wait over an hour for my carry out  safe to say I will not be coming back again unfortunately."
1 star rating,"The only downside is that it's not close enough! Or I would be there more often.   Also a bit slow on service, but to me it was much worth the wait.   I agree with some others that it's the best vegan food around.    Look forward to finding time to visit again."
5 star rating,This place is great! I inhaled everything I ordered and can't wait to be back. Only wish they served the entire menu during lunch hours. Was craving the hummus platter but it was only served during dinner? Still. A great place.
5 star rating,"Must have been there on an ""off"" day. Not a single thing here was good.My wife is vegetarian and I am not. We eat vegetarian and vegan together often. She tried Vegan Soul at Vegiefest in Novi and said it was good, so we decided to travel all the way to this location for dinner last Friday.Here's a run-down of our visit:1. The water in the fancy bottle at the table is Detroit tap water. It tastes pretty bad and is strongly chlorinated. I'm fine with it (grew up on it) but wife was not. Funny how their menu touts ""unbleached and unbromated flour"" and don't bother with the drinking water.2. We got the hush puppies to start. It is a soul food restaurant, after all. They came out small, burned black, very dry, and hurt our teeth. It tasted somewhat like falafel mix.3. She got the Seitan Pepper Steak. She said it was bland but acceptable. I tasted the green beans and they were definitely freezer burned. Yuck.4. The signature Soul Platter. Wow. It was all crap. This was a disgrace to ""soul food"". The whole plate lacked seasoning. Mac-n-cheese was a creamy-textured substance over shell pasta that resembled Mac-n-cheeese, but didn't have much flavor. The cornbread was atrocious. Another reviewer gave three stars and said that it was dry and he needed lots of water to get it down. How is this acceptable? See the picture, it's so compacted and dry that it's pretty much inedible. The Hoppin' John had absolutely no seasoning. It was beans and rice, boiled in water, thrown on a plate. No flavor. I started questioning if they even had beans in this. The Maple Glazed Yams were sweet, soggy, and tasted like they were from a can. The greens had some seasoning -- it seems like they had some sort of broth on them. They were bitter, though.Will not return, unfortunately. We had high hopes as we both love soul food, but this place is garbage."
1 star rating,"Wow! By far the best vegan comfort food restaurant that I have ever been to. Went there on a 1 night lay over before going to vegan friendly Toronto, but this place made a lasting impression on me and my wife. When in Detroit, if you're vegan it is a must to stop by here."
5 star rating,"Went in for a casual lunch with a friend. We are promptly greeted by our server who then checks out and after about 20 minutes we are greeted by a new server. I order an ATL (Avocado Lettuce Tomato) and wait the average wait for food. When it arrives to me I notice something interesting. There was no avocado on it. After a minute of trying to get a server's attention, I explain how there is no avocado on my sandwich. It was just lettuce and tomato. And she informed me they were out of avocado. Like what? How do you run out of avocado and let me order it? And then how does the cook make a sandwich and not notice? Silly place. I chose another meal and then had to wait for that. The place is cool and their menu is good though."
3 star rating,"Very nice restaurant, nice sit in area, great service and very great food. Was greeted very politely as soon as We walked through the door. Ordered the Soul Food Platter it was ready in less than 10min. Will be back to try more!"
4 star rating,"I am absolutely in love with the smothered tempeh. Three pieces of tempeh covered in mushroom gravy, smashed garlic potatoes on the side and topped with green beans cooked to perfection, fresh green onions and sliced almonds. The mushroom gravy is incredibly flavorful. The green beans are crisp and tender. I cannot wait to go back and sample more! The restaurant had a casual vibe and was perfect for an intimate dinner catching up with my friend. I'm salivating while reminiscing on this delightful dish!"
4 star rating,"Detroit Vegan Soul is a solid ten. When we arrived for lunch on a Saturday there was a five minute wait. By the time we were done there was a line out the door. The place was packed and for good reason. I brought my dad here and we split the soul platter and the caesar salad. The soul platter came with mac-n-cheese, collards, maple glazed yams, black-eyed peas, born rice, and a cornbread muffin. The mac-n-cheese was my favorite but the collards were also excellent. The caesar salad my dad ordered was one of the best I've had. It was simple - romaine lettuce, capers, croutons and a few other things. But the dressing was divine. I wish they sold it. Overall, my dad and I both loved the food and my dad said he is going to bring all of his friends here. We also loved our waitress Bri who was kind enough to answer my dad's many (many) questions."
5 star rating,"Great little vegan restaurant in town, with fun atmosphere and friendly staff. I had the vegan Cesar Chavez salad with added tempeh and my lovely dinner companion had a veggie burger with coco bacon and yam chips. I would have tried a red velvet cupcake for dessert but I ate too much."
4 star rating,Clean open and cozy atmosphere.  Soul Food made from Whole Food is the perfect description for this place!  The spring rolls were to die for! The yams on the soul platter were heavenly!  I was expecting the mac and cheese to taste bland but I was presently surprised.  I am visiting on business and will definitely return to sample the great food!
5 star rating,"Darn it, DVS.  Had to go changing my review again due to false advertising.  as I got carry out brunch of sweet potato stack, The picture on the menu clearly showed three pancakes. Imagine my disgust to arrive home with only two pancakes in the order.  $9.00 for two pancakes!!!!  I'd never buy at that price."
2 star rating,"I've been back to DVS again and again and was so impressed that I needed to update.  The meals are consistently delicious and the flavors are what I'm looking for when eating soul food. The catfish sandwich has me hooked. The staff is stellar. They have made accommodations for me based on several day worth of orders. Once, the guy told me it would be 20 min so I took a walk around the neighborhood. He actually came out and found me when the food came out sooner than expected because he didn't want it to get cold! Such service!!!!My only complaint is that the restaurant does not have a general nutrition chart or any idea of how many calories in each dish. I get it- soul food/calories shouldn't be the objective.  But I still wanna know for the next day to see if I have to limit myself."
5 star rating,"VSF make the best mock catfish sandwich I've ever had. It tasted like heaven. I ate the entire thing and was tempted to go with another but instead ordered the okra stew and soul platter. The stew was cooked to perfection and was flavor able. The only things preventing me from giving a four or five star had to do with the soul platter. The collard greens were so salty, I gagged on a bite full and had to spit it in my napkin. Perhaps less salt to start and let people eating decided if they feel like licking a block of salt. The entrees were flavor able bit cold. Being the only group in the restaurant , it should have come to our table at least lukewarm. I'd suggest heating everything to at least 140 degrees to real put some warmth into the comfort cooking. With all that being said, I love this place, the ambience , and the people. I'll keep trying , just lay off the salt pretty please ?  ;)"
3 star rating,"The restaurant was small and cozy, the seating and space is comparable to something you would expect from a coffee shop. It had a welcoming vibe, as we entered we were immediately greeted and then seated. Lord Jesus, this was everything I hoped and expect vegan food to be! I ordered the Soul Platter which had mac n' cheese, black-eyed peas over rice, collard greens, yams and a cornbread muffin! This food hit the spot and was loaded with flavor and wasn't seasoned much from what I could taste... but I wasn't mad about it! I could really taste the true flavor of the food without it being loaded down with salt and seasoning. For anyone that needs to spice it up there was seasoned pepper, pink Himalayan salt and cayenne pepper at the table. My husband had the ""Catfish"" with a side of potatoes and a corn medley. The catfish tofu was covered in a crunchy cornmeal shell and tasted amazing with the tarter sauce, the potatoes were perfectly cooked and the corn was so fresh! We were super impressed with the overall flavor that we literally cleaned our plates off! That doesn't happen often. We were both full but decided to try out some dessert, I got the gluten free vanilla cupcake and the hubby got the Snickerdoodle cake. I liked his cake much more than my cupcake because it was a little grainy and heavy... but still tasty! If you have made it to the end of my review, trust me just go! You won't be disappointed."
5 star rating,"Amazing food and the service was excellent! I had the DVS Breakfast Sandwhich and I would have sworn it wasn't vegan, gret taste"
5 star rating,"This is one of the best vegetarian restaurants I have been to. I go here 2-3 times weekly. The food and service is impeccable. Their soul platter is to ""die for.""  I would recommend meat eaters to try this and you will truly enjoy the experience."
5 star rating,Waited there for almost 20 mins to be told you are out of the food This place is a joke.  Great business plan. It's alright though Plenty of places that will take my money .
1 star rating,I would have given five stars if it wasn't for sub par service.  Ordered two apps about four minutes apart and it took over twenty minutes to get the first one and the second came after dinner was served...which arrived almost 30 minutes after app #1.   Food was very good. Tried the hush puppies for the first time and they were really tasty. The tofu bites are a must. I chose smothered tempeh and it was quite good. Server was nice and I don't blame her for slow service. Check this little gem out but plan on at least 90 minutes...their carry out service seems to take precedence.
4 star rating,"Everything about this place is great. Good people, nice atmosphere and amazing vegan dishes. Definitely a must go to for any vegan visiting Detroit. Go to BRBQ  sandwich and redskin potatoes."
4 star rating,"I've tried this place before a couple of years ago and their coconut BLT was disgusting. I recently gave it another go with something else, and again same experience, complete and utter disappointment. For the quality, taste, and rude service that I received plus the overpriced amount the owner charges for the ""food"" that is served, I don't understand how this place stays in business. Then again, hipsters will eat and buy anything that is ""vegan"" as long as they have to put little to no effort traveling to."
1 star rating,"Their Coconut BLT is gross.  Their kids meal price is very high for the amount of food, and not everyone wants to feed Mac-n-cheese to their kids either. The food and drinks prices are very over priced for the quality and taste."
2 star rating,"You must try the spinach lasagne, it is out of this world. You will not be disappointed. Loved the simple side salad with the cashew cheese Caesar dressing, loved it! The hibiscus tea is so good and refreshing. A must try is their pumpkin and vanilla cupcakes!! The wait staff is wonderful and they play the best calming music, makes for a perfect dining experience."
5 star rating,"We drove all the way to Detroit from Ypsilanti to eat here! Just once, and I wish on everything I could have gotten to go back at least once before we moved to California. This place has amazing veggie food. In fact, the menu was gleaming with options I didn't know what to pick! The southern fried tofu is to die for! The place is tiny, and cozy, but friendly and welcoming!"
5 star rating,"Love this vegan spot! I craveeeee the catfish sandwich. I also love the location, the beautiful restaurant, and the historical references to the city. Every dish I've had is so great, and service is always exceptional."
5 star rating,"I am not vegan (""a vegan""?). I love yummy food that feels cared for in preparation and delivery. DVS has that. Great staff, great food with textures and flavored that don't fall into the stereotypical vegan milieu. Of course, basics. Lots of soy, nuts and fresh veggies. Soul food, yes.Favorites: all the smoothies, the fried ""catfish"" sandwich, the kale salad, desserts and the sweet potatoes.When you make it here, smile. You're in one of Detroit's true, locally-owned, locally-sourced, community-loved establishments."
4 star rating,"I was visiting Detroit from out of town and stopped at Detroit Vegan Soul on a Tuesday. I was so excited to eat some amazing vegan comfort food (had read great things online) but they weren't open. There was nothing on their website, no note on the door. A barista working at the coffee shop next door said that they owners work really hard and sometimes bend the hours. I saw other groups outside the restaurant also perplexed and frustrated that it wasn't open. A group of girls walked around the side of the building and said they spoke with a man (who I'm guessing worked there) that said they weren't going to open at all that day. It was our last day in Detroit so we didn't get to go. Very disappointed."
1 star rating,"Yep. The service is a little slow. So, go with a friend and enjoy each others company.That's the only negative to be said about this place. I'm a wordsmith by my own admission and I am at a complete loss for words to do this food justice. ""Holy shit this is amazing"" was about the best I could do.We started with the Black Eyed Pea Hummus. Right then we knew we were in for a treat. We shared the Coconut BLT. Coconut bacon? The vegan food gods have smiled upon us.Mac and Cheese so good you want to smack your mama. Potato salad that would convert any mayo lover. And then the Collard Greens. This is where I really draw a blank.  I am a greens lover, and since going vegan I feared I would never enjoy them quite the same way without a little Wilbur or Babe to flavor them. Well, holy shit, they are amazing. Order two.Run, don't walk. Seriously. ."
5 star rating,Best food EVER! Best vegan food we've ever had. They're also environmentally conscious which makes this place even better. Even their forks are made from plants and are biodegradable! The food is seriously amazing. Please open one in Grand Rapids!
5 star rating,customer service was excellent. The setting was very intimate and clean. I really enjoyed the catfish tofu and mac and cheese. They also had great dessert options. The strawberry cobbler was pretty tasty!! Two thumbs up.
5 star rating,"This was such a great lunch choice. It's a little off of the beaten path from downtown but worth it. I had the Fried Catfish Tofu sandwich. It was the real deal. A side of greens and some yam chips...perfect. The hibiscus juice was nice as well. Nice, quaint place with good service."
4 star rating,"I wish I didn't seem like such a carnivorous grinch for this review, but this seems like a perfect example of vegetarian ""lowering the bar"", which we all know happens all the time.Come on: was this food really that memorable?  Enough to pay $6 for some vegan mac 'n cheese in a serving dish not much bigger than a typical ramekin?I'm being harsh, because, to be fair, nothing I've had here has been bad.  Most of what I've had has been good--and particularly good texture-wise (which is often the vegan restaurant's Achilles heel).  The mac 'n cheese is yummy.  And, for only two visits, I've eaten a LOT at Vegan Soul because I had to order and order again to feel remotely satiated.  And yes, I know that seitan is a bit pricey and doesn't have the fat or protein content of real meat.  I'm not a total vegan philistine.But a $12 scrambler on toast should look like a main course and not an appetizer.  I almost felt like the cooks went out of their way to find the smallest pieces of toast possible--like they procured German bread slices or something.  The much larger combo platter is more satisfying, but at nearly $20, it darn well better be.  Isn't part of the point of soul food is that it's quintessential comfort food with a southern bend that makes the most of flavor on a tight budget?Then there's that service: always friendly, always inept.  Some of it probably has to do with poor communication with the back of the house, such as when you've ordered, and then, 15 minutes into waiting, the server tells you that she forgot to tell you they were out of what you ordered.  But how should we respond when this happens: you're with a group, and one person gets his meal first, waits 5+ minutes to eat, finally relents and starts eating, FINISHES eating, waits 2 more minutes and then finally the other people's food comes out?  Who's to blame--the chef or the wait staff?  Especially when the place only seats about 25 people....The coffee here is fantastic, and, were it not for the price and  the abysmal service, I imagine--and hope some day--I would be able to double my stars.  But I'm not going to be the one opting to take a group out to Vegan Soul, so who knows when that'll be."
2 star rating,Great food! Not vegan but I love how this food doesn't make me feel like crab after I eat it
5 star rating,"The decor is awesome and the staff is quite friendly. However, listen up before you get their main course dishes. Had the BBQ tofu and smothered tempeh along with the Mac n cheese. The concept of the food is great and the prices are very fair as well but they really take advantage of the sodium content. Everything on all those dishes we got was a bit too salty which makes pretty much everything taste better. Tempeh crust was already seasoned and salty enough but then they throw on another layer of salty gravy. Was looking for unsavory contrast but the mashed potatoes had the salty gravy on them too. BBQ tofu smothered in super salty bbq sauce and the kale it came with...you guessed it- bbq flavored with salt. Maybe their salads/sandwiches are different but can't speak on that 100%. This review isn't meant to berate the place but rather maybe hoping that you guys can alter your recipes to reduce all that saltiness."
3 star rating,"Update: This place is amazing. They've since obtained Frank's hot sauce. And the food is amazing. No alcohol, which is a bit of a bummer. Service is fast. Food is great.----This review may be biased and unfair. But, I'll share my experience anyways. My fiancee eats seafood/fish, and I'm vegan. It works for us. However, one day, he went to Captain Jays to get some fried catfish. Upon smelling this catfish, I said ""Hell yea, I know a place where they have vegan catfish. I remember seeing ""Detroit Vegan Soul"" somewhere, and recalling they had vegan catfish (made with Tofu, of course). I looked at the menu, and I said we should go. I order the catfish/greens/vegan cheesy grits. Before I opened the box of food, I asked for hot sauce. They only had srirachi. I tilted my head and became skeptical. In the car, I opened the takeout box and saw the most neatly compiled arrangement of ""soul food"" I had ever seen in my entire life. The ""catfish"" tofu was comprised of four perfectly arranged triangles. The ""greens"" were carefully positioned in their portion of their fortress in the box, and the cheesy grits didn't spill out of their own fortress. I was unimpressed. This isn't soulfood. Meanwhile, my fiances's Captain Jays takeout boxes had sauce spilling everywhere, and the hot sauce we ordered was no where to be found. Srirachi does not equal hot sauce. Franks = hot sauce. Srirachi = hipsters doing hot sauce ironically. Now, I started by saying that this review may be unfair. And I meant it. I've had vegan meat substitutes that taste similar to the real thing (Field Roast sausages and burgers for example), so I was under the impression that when this place said that it had ""vegan"" catfish, that it would be a meat substitute that was seasoned in a way that tasted in fact like catfish. Perhaps I had the wrong expectation. Overall, I was disappointed with the food. Not because it was bad (it was decent), but because I was expecting something different. That being said, I would be ok with coming back here and trying it again. This time, with the expectation that it won't be like ""Seva"", but that it will be like a nice, neat, super clean, and well-managed establishment."
5 star rating,Decided to try this place out after I heard from a co-worker that the food was good.  What can i say the best part was the the greens.  I order the soul food platter.... and i can say that there was no soul in that platter.  I normally dont write reviews but i was so meh about it had to say something.  Only resturant where i ate and wanted to get a burger after words i dont even like fast food like that.. but a mac donalds burger sounded more appealing.  *Overrated place*
2 star rating,"Had a great lunch- 'blt' wrap and Mac n cheese. Both were pretty tasty and satisfying. It's a cozy little cafe, too"
4 star rating,"Gravy gravy gravy. They have gravy that is veg friendly!!!  I had the smothered tempe and a ginger beer. It was so good that I went home and tried to make a homemade version. Sadly, my gravy pales in comparison. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu."
5 star rating,"What jerks. A group of friends an I (about 10) wanted to stop by DVS to have lunch on a Saturday at 11am. Since it's a little bit of a larger group, we decided to call ahead to let them know that we'd be stopping by tomorrow. The conversation?""I'm sorry, we can't accommodate groups larger than six"". ""We aren't making a reservation, we just wanted to give you a heads up.""""Well, you can't come in groups larger than six.""Basically, they just lost a lot of potential business, especially since many of us were really looking forward to trying it out. Many of us are vegetarian/vegan, so it would have surely created return customers.*Note: The guy I talked to said the dining area could not hold that number of people, but we could do take-out.  My friend called back, and she was told that the kitchen cannot accommodate that many people at one time. So which is it? Excuses."
1 star rating,It's ok. Too expensive in my opinion. I also found a bet in my salad which is a big deal to me because that's disgusting. But overall it's ok.
3 star rating,"I finally got around to trying Detroit Vegan Soul and I'm sad I waited so long! Everything sounded good, so I ordered the Soul Platter to try a variety of sides. The sweet potatoes were delicious; perfectly cooked and perfectly sweet. The black eyed peas were probably the best I've ever eaten. The corn bread looked funny, but tasted good. The mac and cheese was okay; I'm glad that it wasn't just slathered in melted fake cheese like other places do (yuck). Though the cheese sauce was tasty, the noodles were cooked within an inch of their life. The amazing collard greens made up  for the noodles being mushy. All in all, it was a great meal.I'm looking forward to coming back to try the catfish tofu & grits, which sounds awesome. The prices are a little out of my comfort zone for non-special-occasion food, and the service was a teensy bit slow, but the pleasant space and the delicious food made the experience a positive one. For a new restaurant, they're off to a great start."
4 star rating,Best darn catfish sandwich that is not catfish in the world. Broaden your horizons at check out Detroit's fine vegan/vegetarian restaurants.
5 star rating,"Best ""catfish"" sandwich in Detroit. High quality tasty vegan vegetarian cuisine in a authentic neighborhood setting. I always try a cup of the soup of the day."
5 star rating,"Make sure you go at a slow time or make reservations in advance. Wonderful vegan soul food. I thought I had already been spoiled by Souley Vegan in Oakland, but DVS is aiming a little bit higher into fine dining territory."
5 star rating,"Went back a couple weeks ago to try the Catfish Tofu Sandwich that everyone has been raving about on here. One word, three syllables...AH-MA-ZING. Just do it...vegan or not, you won't be disappointed."
5 star rating,"I am not Vegan, but I was so happy to see a restaurant in my neighborhood that didn't have a drive thru that I would have tried just about anything. I was thrilled to find that, while Vegan and Soul Food seemed oxymoronic, the food, service and ambiance of Detroit Vegan Soul delivered. I decided to go with The Soul Platter as it seemed to have the most variety and I wanted to get a feel for the food. The sweet potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection and the black eyed peas had a nice smokey flavor. The greens, while a little salty for my palate, were delicious as well. Now, let's address the elephant on the plate...vegan Mac and cheese. I am a hugely gigantic lover of Mac and Cheese and was hoping for the best here. Unfortunately the taste of the soy cheese was a little off putting for me, though the dish did live up to my personal motto that everything tastes better when drenched in BBQ sauce. To finish out the meal I ventured into Vegan dessert territory and was not disappointed with the Snickerdoodle Cake. All and all a super satisfying excursion in to the world of Vegan Soul Food and one I am sure to relive time and again...and not just because it is one of my only options in West Village."
4 star rating,"Meh. I didn't love Vegan Soul much at all, but the server was nice and the atmosphere was friendly, so I'll give it a middle of the road review. I'm also not actually vegan, so I think my expectations of soul food weren't on par with what I'm going to get in a vegan meal. I ordered the collard green spring rolls, which I expected to like, but they didn't have very much flavor to them without dipping them in the accompanying sauce. I would have done without had I known. Afterwards, I ordered the soul food platter, which consists of collard greens (well seasoned and delicious, and on par with eating greens at my grandmother's house), candied yams (standard, nothing spectacular), black eyed peas (a little bland but serviceable, if you're hungry), and mac n cheese.As a black woman with southern roots, the mac n cheese was the dealbreaker. Again, maybe it was my expectations of a food I've been eating since I was probably 3 years old, but the substitute mac was mushy, with a cheesy-ish texture but none of the flavor I'm accustomed to. I LOVE mac n cheese, to the point that even if I don't love the version that's in front of me, I'll clean the plate, but I took a few bites of this stuff and had to put the fork down. I'm sad to say it, because I wanted to love it, but I hated it. For dessert, I had their apple pie. Lots of oats taste, not the same as something stuffed with sticks of butter, but it was actually pretty good. Not something I'd come back specifically for, but I would have it again. Overall, this isn't the spot for me. I think if you love soul food and are NOT vegan, you'll leave here disappointed. I may come again to support the business trying to do its thing, but it won't be because I was blown away by the food."
3 star rating,This is a cute little place with a small but delicious menu. I'm not a vegan or even a vegetarian but I love lunches here! The okra stew and the catfish sandwich are both amazing and the spinach lasagna available on Friday and Saturday is my new favorite.
4 star rating,It's hard to believe that everything on the menu is vegan. They do a fantastic job with the flavor combinations and menu options. I've never had black-eyed pea hummus and it was deeeeelicious. I had the Soul Platter as a main course and it was filling. I definitely made a happy plate and left very satisfied.
5 star rating,"I love that everything is vegan here, so it makes ordering easier. We happened to come the first time around closing and they kindly offered to seat us only because others were still waiting on food. Service was great and quick and the soul food was a nice change from the usual."
4 star rating,The food here is absolutely DELICIOUS!  We're here to run the Detroit Marathon and found this restaurant. My vegan daughter and daughter in law (from Rhode Island) and I were excited with all of the options.  The DVS burger is awesome!
5 star rating,"Absolutely love the food here! The employees are all so kind and inviting. Super clean cool place with delish vegan food! Try the southern fried tofu wrap, it is amazing and my favorite!!"
5 star rating,It's  a cozy  nice little  local  vegan place. We dined  at this place on Sunday and they  offer special sunday menu. Ordered  stack  of  pan cakes and  home style breakfast.  Both items came delicious  and we absolutely  enjoyed  the  food and atmosphere.  Waitress  was very friendly  and knowledgeable  on items and ingredients.  They do offer some vegan deserts and we did not  get a  change to try those.
4 star rating,Food and service have been spectacular every time I visit. Coconut BLT = amazing. This place will please even the biggest of meat-eaters!
4 star rating,"I've been waiting for this restaurant ever since tasting their food at the Vegan Fest.What I ate:Okra stew - soo yummy! Full of okra, black eyed peas & an excellent broth. Soul platter - vegan Mac and cheese was one of the best I've ever tasted. Black eyed peas and rice was okay, not the best thing on the platter. Greens, too salty, but my husband thought they were fantastic. (Different strokes - different folks) Candied yams, delicious. Cornbread muffin, dry but tasty. Hibiscus tea- too sweet couldn't finish. Overall - I will be coming back. There are more menu items that I want to try."
5 star rating,"Catfish is a must have! We ordered a bunch of sides and everything was delicious. Also, we were super in a rush on our way to the airport and they managed for us to get everything in a timely manner even though they were super busy!"
5 star rating,My husband and I went to this restaurant for the first time this weekend and we loved it! He ordered smothered tofu and I ordered BBQ tofu both were delicious. It was pretty busy and tight but the service was still good.  We will return again without a doubt.
5 star rating,Amazing inventive vegan food that tastes sooo good!! So glad they're opening a west side location. Glad to see this business growing! My children love their okra and black-eyes pea soup w/ muffins!
5 star rating,"I had the catfish tofu with collards and mac and cheese. Everything was perfectly seasoned and had great texture. I only wished the sides were served hotter, and not just warm. I will definitely be back to try out more of the menu!"
4 star rating,Great place. Lives up easily to its glowing reputation. Tasty and refreshing food. Excellent service. Light and energizing atmosphere. Will definitely be back. Jealous of those in the neighborhood in walking distance from here.
4 star rating,"Very good ""Catfish"" Tofu sand which! I loved the homemade sauce on it. However, the yam chips were very cold and mushy:/ Overall it was a good experience and it's cool that it's an ALL VEGAN restaurant. (Customer service was great!)"
4 star rating,"This restaurant is amazing! Great food and great service. The Southern Tofu bites were my favorite and I'm not even a huge tofu fan. Cobbler was to die for! Catfish tofu, okra soup, candied yams, mashed potatoes and gravy and mac and cheese were all really good too! You have to try this place vegan or not!"
5 star rating,"The food! Awesome. I've eaten at almost every vegetarian/vegan spot in the D and it was refreshing to finally get some soul food that is actually good... I had the veg platter and my friend had the tofu catfish. We simply nibbled off of the other's plate. The food was hot and fresh. Will definitely go back soon. The sweet tea was delicious - not bland, but not overly sweetened. The service was prompt, though I can see how the kitchen can get backed up."
4 star rating,"My favorite Vegan place in Detroit. If there were one major downside it is the insane wait that this place generates after 4pm and especially closer to 6. The business can detract from the service, so if you want a meal here in the evening I suggest ordering takeout at least 20 mins in advance. The desserts are all very good aswell."
5 star rating,"I love this place! The food is awesome and for those of us who actually grew up with soul food, this place is a treat! I plan to get carry outs from now on though. The restaurant is VERY small and is often crowded with smelly hipsters.....that's a different story though. This is a great place and its also nice that its a black owned business! Not to mention what a great idea vegan soul food is!(Also, the owners might want to work on waiting times for the food. I was okay because I know they were cooking it fresh but it does take QUITE a while for the food to come out)"
4 star rating,"Staff is incredibly attentive and nice. Very impressed by their ability to turn vegan ingredients into such authentic soul food. I have gluten and dairy allergies and it's a nice change not having to ask the waiter what has what in it. I had the Soul Platter which offered a good variety, a taste of everything."
5 star rating,We had an excellent Sunday brunch here. Everything was tasty and the prices were very reasonable.
5 star rating,"Today, I visited for the first time for my birthday, and I was very pleased.  We were the very first customers there (they opened their doors promptly at 11 am), so we had zero problems with speed of service as some people complained. One of the owners served us and she was very nice and even stopped by our table to chat for a minute before our food arrived (however she still managed to balance the act of giving us space and tending to us, which is good because I've been to other restaurants where they are either way over the top with the talking, or compeltely forget about you). FYI, The dining space and tables are made for individual groups of two or maybe three. It was very clean-looking.It started to get pretty crowded around 12:00 with 3-4 small groups coming in at the same time, but with that crowd came another worker--a waiter I suppose. I ordered the catfish tofu sandwich w/ wedges, potato salad, okra stew, and hibiscus tea, and a slice of cinnamon coffee cake. My eyes were bigger than my belly so I had to take some home.  But the food was great. I especially like the catfish tofu sandwich--everything in it made it taste good from the bread to the batter on the tofu. The potato salad is good, the okra stew is equally tasty, and the hibiscus tea is as expected.Glad I went. I'll be a regular..."
5 star rating,"Best Peach Cobbler I've ever had. My God, I regret not ordering two of them. Food is tasty. Only four stars because we waited far too long to be seated."
4 star rating,"I was super psyched to try this place since I'm vegan and I LOVE soul food. We started with the fried tofu cubes with a homemade sauce which were really good. I also got the vegan fish patty sandwich, which was around $9 and good but nothing amazing. I also ordered the $14 soul plate, which I was expecting to blow me away but I found it to be really average and definitely overpriced. There was a little mediocre mac and cheese, but the rest were just beans, greens, and rice, so I'm not sure why it's so much more than the sandwiches, which were much better. I sampled my friend's lasagna, which was pretty good. The service was super friendly and I would give the place another shot if I visit Detroit again."
3 star rating,"I absolutely loved it! Everything was excellent tempeh catfish, the soul platter and the Caesar Chavez salad"
5 star rating,"They are so incredibly welcoming and friendly here! The atmosphere is lovely. I had the veggie burger and it was delicious, however I would recommend NOT getting it with the vegan cheese. They use the Daiya block cheese and when it's melted, it has this weird texture and taste. The burger was delicious otherwise and I appreciate that you can add a bunch of yummy toppings to it! I also had a gluten free cupcake which I was not impressed by. Overall, great place and I will return!"
4 star rating,"I found it online ""Vegan Soulfood Restaurant"" Hmmmm .....as I said to myself in my head.  I was reading the menu. They had things like Barbecue tofu, Smothered Tempeh ???, Catfish tofu, Southern Fried Tofu bites and the list goes on.  Being a vegetarian myself am very familiar with the substitute proteins. BUT to believe this place can make it taste like SOUL FOOD this I have to TASTE!!!  Well I went and let me tell you I AM A BELIEVER!!!!  I love the location. The street strip it was located on reminded me of being in Royal Oak/Ferndale area. That area is getting a face lift. The resturant ambiance is charming. OK, let's get to what I ordered. I had the greens, tofu catfish, macaroni and cheese and some yams! BABY... Let me tell you the taste was quality!!! I enjoyed my meal to the fullest! I said to myself is my grandmother cooking back there!! She could cook some soulfood. That is what true SOUL FOOD should taste like. GOOD FOR THE SOUL BUT THIS IS A VEGAN VERSION. MY NEW FAVORITE PLACE. Great customer Service!!!!! Now you know that is important to me. I Topped the meal off with a ""Snicker doodle cake""  TRULY VEGAN SOULFOOD!!!"
4 star rating,"I'm not a vegan but wanted to check out this restaurant since I'm in town for the weekend. Can I say YUMMY?!  OMG, everything that had touched my plate was eaten.  From the Southern Fried Tofu Bites, to the Catfish Tofu, to the Seitan Pepper Steak, to the Collard Greens, the Candied Yams, and Black Eyed Peas & Rice, I'm totally speechless.  Those yams and broccoli though.  Yummy!!!  My friend and I loved our meal.  Since my friend lives here, she's going to bring more people here.  It's worth a trip folk. The staff and the owners are amazing!!!  I wish I had more time to stop by again but definitely will the next time in town."
5 star rating,"You will wait an hour food. This is not hyperbole. You will wait an hour. You will want coffee, but they will tell you the machine is broken, all the while drinking their own iced coffee from Red Hook next door, which they trade among themselves because they like it so much. You will notice people who are seated getting up and leaving, because they don't want to wait anymore. A family comes in and the other waitress will serve them within ten minutes. You will still be waiting. You will wonder who hired and who trained your waitress, because you have worked in restaurants for years and know she is trying so hard to avoid working that it is more work than doing an actual job. You will wonder why you are squandering your life. Your husband, who is not a vegan, who brought you here just for you, leans over, and smiles. ""We are never eating at another vegan restaurant again."" You go to Red Hook next door. The coffee is really good. You realize DVS is not a restaurant. It is a performance piece, a beautiful satire in which you are but a mere player. Brava!"
5 star rating,"My friend and I went down there for lunch. We loved the atmosphere and service. The decor was cute and cozy. The food was amazing. I had the DVS burger and my friend had the soul food platter. Everything taste fresh with lots of flavor. We both tried a cup of the tomato basil soup, AMAZING! Our server Anna was very nice and helpful with the menu. Overall we can't wait to go back. I would recommend this place for healthy, tasty, vegan options."
5 star rating,"Fantastic food! I had the BBQ tofu sandwich today with yam chips and coleslaw, and it was excellent. I love the fact that a vegan restaurant exists in Detroit and I now have somewhere to eat that is not only healthy but very tasty!"
5 star rating,"I stopped into Detroit Vegan Soul in mid-June while in town for a concert. Morgan served our table and was very friendly and fun. I ordered the barbeque tofu which came with corn on the cobb, kale, and potato salad. It was tough to choose a favorite item on my plate! Everything, including the bites I had from my friend's orders, was seasoned right, beautiful looking, and well portioned. Great price point for excellent food! I can't wait to return here during my next visit to Detroit."
5 star rating,"Went there for the first time last Tuesday and can't wait to go back again tomorrow!  The food was tasty, the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was inviting"
4 star rating,"My husband and I went here for lunch today and we were both super impressed by everything. The food was delicious! I had the DVS Burger with vegan cheese, and my guy had The ""Catfish"" Sandwich - both were super tasty! The side of coleslaw was on point. The price is totally fair for what you get. The atmosphere was nice and clean, and the service was friendly. All around great experience. I can't wait to go back."
5 star rating,"Detroit Vegan soul is a Vegan restaurant whose time has come! What a jewel in the neighborhood from which it is blossoming!  My husband & I were visiting Detroit from California, which by the way lends itself to many vegan options. Given those experiences, how delighted we were to fine Vegan fare with a Southern twist. We live in Florida part time.  We had the house made millet bean burger w/ fresh made yam fries & shared the Caesar salad w/ cashew Parmesan & a yummy house made dressing . This food will totally satisfy the plant based crowds & more importantly make it easier for carnivores to become acquainted with the delicious- ness of Vegan food!  The atmosphere was clean , comfortable & had a cool vibe. I felt the Love in this food, which can only come straight from the kitchen staff , trickling down from the owners! There is power in sitting around a table eating mindfully & slowly amongst a diverse crowd in a beautiful neighborhood! Keep up the hard work Detroit Vegan soul, you're doing more then you know!

5 star rating,"I've eaten a lot of vegan Mac n' Cheese, and usually it's meh at best. Why keep eating it, if I was continually disappointed?? Because somewhere in my heart I knew I was someday going to find Detroit Vegan Soul, and that their vegan mac was going to be AMAZING. (Along with everything else I ate there, for the record.)The prophecy has been fulfilled; vegan mac can be delicious; go try this place today."
5 star rating,"Been here many times and no complaints except that portions could be a bit bigger...or maybe that's just me being greedy. Most recently had the smothered tempeh-the gravy was so scrumptious that my mouth is watering just thinking about it now. Ohhh and the buttery green beans. That hibiscus punch. Servers are always super nice and on top of refills. Interior is sleek.  Tables are close, which isn't so bad because you get to meet other fans of this damn good food. Best restaurant in all of Metro Detroit."
4 star rating,"First time here. The atmosphere is light and casual. Unfortunately, the service was slow. I'm not sure if that's the norm, but it was slow today. The food was pretty good. I would rate it as a 4. The menu is limited, but has a good range of selections for Sunday. Next time I'm in the area, I would try it again."
3 star rating,"Such a dream come true to have a place like this, let alone in Detroit! Prices are incredibly reasonable for vegan food served up at an environmentally friendly restaurant. Everything I have ordered has been consistently well seasoned, fresh and well prepared.When I order something that contains their BBQ sauce and also has coleslaw included ... oh my gosh, its so addictive. Something about the way their coleslaw and BBQ sauce compliment each other is one of my favorite things I have ever discovered while eating out.I love their collard greens and I am so glad I can get greens other than kale here (but they have kale, too, for those of you who are obsessed with it.)Some of their drinks are very sweet, which I love, so if you are avoiding overly sweet things make sure you inquire about whether something is pre-sweetened. That's the only caveat I have about this place!"
5 star rating,Awesome!!!! Great food and atmosphere!!! The peach cobbler with coconut vanilla ice cream was on point. The Burger with red potatoes and Cole slaw was great. This place is our new family Vegan spot!!!
5 star rating,Is tumbled upon this place when taking my nephew to lunch and what a happy accident.  I had the vegan BLT with bacon flavored shaved coconut and my nephew had BBQ tofu sandwich.  He had never eaten tofu and loved it.  My BLT was delicious.   The service was a bit slow but the food made up for it.  You definitely don't have to be vegan to appreciate this fabulous restaurant.  Can't wait to go back'.
5 star rating,"Food is exquisite. And, obviously, not destructive to indulge in. Temperature can become a tad sultry (at least in the summer). Great location, right near Indian Village and set in a sublime corridor."
5 star rating,"This hip little spot did not disappoint. I had the collard greens, the catfish tofu, and the mac & cheese. The greens were so flavorful. It was hard to believe that they were cooked witbout meat. The tofu was seasoned and cooked crisp. The mac & cheese left a little to be desired. It was a little dry for my taste.  Even the sweet tea was delish. I can't wait to visit again to try the other items on the menu."
4 star rating,Delicious. Friendly. Happy atmosphere. I can hardly wait to go back and bring all my vegan friends and relatives. Even for non vegans there is delicious food to be had.
4 star rating,"All vegan restaurants start at 5 stars for me, since there's aren't nearly enough of them!  DVS lost one star per location because they can't seem to plan for a day's worth of menu items; this is true of both locations.  We have made the drive several times, only to be disappointed that one or more of their selections are not available.  If this was a one-time occurrence, we would definitely have overlooked it, since their recipes are quite good (they should share them?), but I have stopped counting the times that we have called to check on our favorite menu items, only to be disappointed to learn they didn't plan sufficiently to cover the day.  Yesterday was a real stand out in this area: We called the west location, and they told us they had our favorite dish, so we made the 30+ minute drive in rush-hour traffic to pick it up our to-go order.  When we got there, they said they had tried to call us back right away (no message) to let us know they had sold the last one right after we called.  Wait, we ordered to-go, and you sold it to someone else?  Actually, I think it was probably just a coincidence, since the west location has always been fabulous to us, and we will definitely continue to make the drive for their delicious food.  We then called the east location, and they gave us the bad news that they were also out of the menu item we wanted.  We can't tell if the raw materials for this particular dish are particularly hard to procure, or if they just need better planning.  I will definitely revise this once we have more successes than failures to eat what we want off of their menu, but I honestly want them to be successful, since their food is something we choose to eat more than once per week (pending availability)."
3 star rating,Detroit Vegan Soul is the best restaurant in the entire state of Michigan.  You will not find better food anywhere else.
5 star rating,"I have ordered their vegan Thanksgiving meal for 3 years now.  They've always been good except for this year (2016).  $25 got you only 3 thin slices of turkey and a couple sides.  In the past, you got a whole mock turkey.  This year the stuffing was bad...maybe too much sage.  Anyway, these Thanksgiving meals are nowhere near worth the high cost anymore."
4 star rating,"I visited DVS for the first time this past weekend and I am so glad that I did. Me and my friend were immediately greeted and seated, upon further inspection I couldn't help but realize the very cute and earthy like decor. This place has a great food selection and the pricing was perfect considering the portions. The wait time is well worth it as we were told that everything was made fresh. I would say that my green beans could have cooked little a longer, but they had a great taste so I won't complain too much. I will definitely come back to try their catfish and maybe even a cupcake.  :)"
5 star rating,"We went for dinner and got there too late to be seated which was fine, so we went back for brunch on Sunday.  The estimated wait for a table was 45 minutes which was also totally fine.  We knew there would be a wait - just be prepared.  It's not a huge place and the wait actually ended up being closer to 60 minutes.  All three of us ordered the homestyle breakfast and we also ordered a separate order of the sweet potato stack to split.  Everything was fantastic - the coffee with with almond milk was stellar, the vegan sausage was as good as we've tasted.  The pancakes were great, the tofu scramble, the potatoes, the toast and homemade jam - all fantastic.  My only complaint was the portion size.  I don't expect or need a massive pile of food, but this was simply not enough - very small portions and we left a little hungry.  That's my only issue.  I am still recommending this place because I love what they are doing there and the taste and flavors were outstanding."
4 star rating,"I discovered this restaurant shortly after going vegan in December 2013. I have gotten takeout many times, and it's always excellent. When my mother passed away in 2014, I ordered a huge amount of catering for a dinner; it was perfect and my family loved it. We actually had both vegan and meat-based soul food at the dinner, and I challenged everyone to try both and decide for themselves whose food tasted better. DVS was the clear winner.I have a double whammy in that I am vegan as well as gluten-free, and DVS has plenty of delicious gluten-free items."
5 star rating,"Listen, it's VERY HARD to pick a favorite place to eat, but this is it, favorite vegan burger, great staff, great guilt-free food.  Thank you for the ambiance you create."
4 star rating,"Just finished up dinner here. It was so delicious! More people need to flock to this place! Proof that anyone can eat vegan and enjoy every bite. The black bean hummus appetizer was a great start and I enjoyed the ""catfish"" sandwich with Cole slaw and red skin potato chips. I also had the hibiscus juice and it was so good I wanted more and more. Don't walk, run! Detroit Vegan Soul is where it's at!"
5 star rating,"I love this place so much. Everything I've tried there has been delicious. I think the BBQ tofu is my favorite, but the catfish tofu is really good, too. Everyone who works there is really nice. I'd go there every day if I lived closer. Love them."
5 star rating,"Over the past three years I have enjoyed coming to Detroit Vegan Soul. Their menu is consistent and predictable, the space is nice and cozy, the food is comforting, the service is good. Some of my favorite dishes are the seitan pepper steak, smothered tempeh, DVS burger, catfish tofu, and BBQ tofu. Also, their sesame broccoli is fantastic. I would definitely recommend Detroit Vegan Soul to vegans and non vegans. I am giving it only four stars because I have noticed a decline in the quality of the food, the service, and the overall experience over the past few months. I have not enjoyed the food quite as much as I used to the last few times I was in. Also, I wish they would close just a bit later, 8pm is early."
4 star rating,"The staff here are always super welcoming and friendly, and the food is delicious! I'm a big fan of their vegan Mac and cheese. The okra stew and seitan pepper steak are also excellent. They make a variety of fresh smoothies too which are always good and not too sweet. I'm docking one star only because the service is slowwwwwwwww. Entrees usually takes at least 40 min to come out. My friends and I also waited about 20-25 min just for drinks (a smoothie and a punch). Also the last two times I've been there, the credit card system wasn't working which also slowed checkout time. Perhaps with more staff members, service would run much more efficiently. Otherwise, it's in a cute neighborhood with free street parking. I certainly will continue to come here for its delicious, healthy vegan eats!"
4 star rating,"Tasty food and a variety of options. It's nice to be able to order anything off the menu, but remember it's a soul food restaurant, and the menu does a good job of staying true to that. Not every dish is a home run, but they offer enough variety in pretty decent portion sizes. The cornbread muffins are delicious. The casual ambiance makes it a great Sunday afternoon lunch spot."
4 star rating,"I just went Vegan a few months ago due to health reasons, there are no restaurants in the burbs for my wife and I to go, so we heard about this place. What a surprise, this was the best vegan food I have ever eaten. So much variety and the mac and cheese is awesome!"
4 star rating,Soo good! I ordered the smothered tempeh. It had that nice hot home cooked vibe. My friend ordered the southern fried tofu wrap and it was beyond delicious. I can't wait to go back and try more dishes. Vegan heaven!
5 star rating,Was in town for the week and decided to try this place. Loved it! Really delicious full meals with lots of flavors that work together well. Was filling but didn't feel super heavy like a non vegan soul food place would feel. Tried the veggie noodle soup and catfish tofu - tasted like the non vegan version! My mom loved the burger with sautéed mushrooms and onions and added avocado. Mac and cheese and collards were also delish!
5 star rating,"NO BREAD??? Tons of sandwiches on the menu, but no bread today, and the server just laughed when he told us. What a joke, go get some bread already. Bad, unfriendly service, very limited menu. Hard for vegans to find a good spot in Detroit."
1 star rating,First timer.  I will be back.  I had the catfish vegan sandwich with yam chips and curt squash soup.  All good and healthy after leaving the health fair.
5 star rating,What a great place for lunch!  Flavorful and healthy food with friendly service!I ordered the bbq tofu sandwich with the yam fries and had a cup of tea.  My colleague had the tempeh wrap. All of the items from the sandwich to the cole slaw (made with vegan mayo) were delightful and tasty. We'll be back soon!
4 star rating,"The customer service was horrible. The owners are very unfriendly. Very disappointed. The food was decent, but the negative attitude of the owners outweighed the whole experience."
1 star rating,Really good. Reasonably priced for a healthier place.
4 star rating,"Fantastic food,friendly service.  Definitely worth the wait!  Telling everyone that I recommend this amazing restaurant over & over again."
5 star rating,"Best kept secret in Detroit! I love eating here and how good the food taste. I feel great after eating here. It is a great environment for a 1 on 1 meeting with someone. Finally, they have great service! Suggestions: Catfish Sandwich"
5 star rating,"Everything was exceptional! Catfish sandwich, Mac&Cheese, yams, collard greens, green smoothie + yellow layered cake. The fact that this place is black-owned, health & environment conscious, and right next door to a wonderful coffee shop + mural make it THAT much better."
4 star rating,"Anyone who thinks this food is good, would hate my cooking. I season my food and give generous portions. I love mac and cheese. I mean really love it. I can even eat the ""blue box"" in an emergency. It is hard to disappoint me when it comes to mac and cheese. Vegan Soul did! I went home and added cheese and put in the oven. I added sugar to the sweet potatoes, garlic salt to the greens and rice, and butter to the cornbread. The ""pepper steak"" should be call lots of peppers with one ""steak"". This was a waste of my time and money. I was not surprised. I just wanted to treat myself because I don't go out much and this is why. I could have done much, much better for less money."
1 star rating,DVS was pretty darn amazing. I wish we had them closer to us. The fried tofu bites were so yummy! All of the food was so yummy! Service was awesome. I can't wait to get back.
5 star rating,"super cute area, i got the soul plate and it was OK, cornbread collard mac n cheese was good didnt care for the yams too much. My boyfriend got the tempeh dish that was DELICIOUS."
4 star rating,"I was back in my Detroit (hometown) for a visit and decided to try this restaurant for the first time on Sunday January 4th with a couple friends. I had been hearing about the restaurant from others and I am glad we went.I had the catfish tofu, mac n cheese, collard greens and cornbread...everything was absolutely amazing. I can say without a doubt this is now my favorite Detroit restaurant and I am not even vegan."
5 star rating,"I had been wanting to try Detroit Vegan Soul for quite some time.  My experience was quite mixed.  The wait staff seated us immediately on a Saturday afternoon. They were courteous and professional. The service was (almost) five star. I had the vegan ""BLT"" with spinach salad and chips.  The appetizer menu was not ready until after 4pm, so we had the corn muffins.  The food was fresh and flavorful and I had no complaints. However,  I had sticker shock when we got the bill. A lunch for two was over $50. The meal was no more expensive than any vegan meal,  but the five mini muffins cost $20! Although the muffins were tasty enough, they were NOT worth $4 each. I wish the server had told us the price when she suggested them. It left a bitter taste in my mouth after a tasty meal."
3 star rating,Listen Up!! This is a must try vegan restaurant period! Rayla will help you select an menu item that's sure to please (Great Waitress). But that's  only 25% of the pleasure... The Chefs are chef'n!! I had the Pepper Steak (seitan) w/broccoli. You'd think I never had Pepper Steak or Broccoli before. THE CHEFs ARE CHEF'n!!! Bring along Ben Franklin and Hamilton for two and enjoy. Peace.
5 star rating,"I've been to DVS a few times now.  I have to say, it is very hit or miss.  Some days the food is amazing and some days it is cold, over cooked, or bland.  One thing that I always enjoy is the okra stew and cornbread.  One of my major complaints, and reason for only giving 3 stars is the constant waiting around.  Today we waited over an hour after we ordered for our food to arrive.  I get that sometimes restaurants are busy but there are literally maybe 8 tables in the entire place and not a single person was eating, everyone was just waiting around for their food."
3 star rating,The only thing that has flavor is the peach cobbler that isn't always available & the Caesar salad. The tofu bites aren't bad but they're over priced. I really want to love this place but it taste like white ppls version of souless soul food. Vegan food should not be bland because it's healthy. 2 stars for the two good menu options I've tried out of them all. Oh & if you order carry out please check your bag before you leave. They've only NOT forgotten something once.
2 star rating,Came here at lunch it was very busy service was a bit slow but worth it. I had the hibiscus tea and Caesar salad which were both really good. I was impressed with the taste of the dressing given it was vegan it tasted better than the regular stuff. My Dad ordered a whole lunch plate everything was great.
4 star rating,"I am neither vegan nor vegetarian, and in my ignorance, I was not sure what to expect. I went last night and had a special, which is an italian sausage sandwich with yam chips and coleslaw. It was delicious and very affordable. I ate a few of my friend's sweet potato bites. Those were very delicious too. I recommend."
4 star rating,"First visit today and was very impressed!  My friend and I arrived a bit after 11a.  We  decided to order carryout and head to Belle Isle because it was such beautiful day.  I ordered the DVS Burger with yam fries and a house made lemonade.  Carry out was ready within 10 minutes and we were on our way to the island.  Opened up my carryout container (all containers and utensils were recycle/biodegradable friendly) to find a generous serving of yam fries and beautiful looking burger.  Then the taste, sooooo good!  The burger wasn't too heavy or too light (as some veggie burgers can be.)  The toppings and condiments were so fresh and in just the right amounts (and my tastebuds are particular!) The burger wasn't dry or super crumbly either as many veggie burgers can also be.  All the flavors worked very well together.  The yam fries were great, not frozen and then fried so you can't taste the flavor anymore.  These were cooked just right and had all the flavor a yam fry should have!  The slaw was just okay, but a nice addition to round out the meal.  The lemonade was good, adding some fresh mint would be a great finishing touch :)I LOVED the design and decor of the interior.  Walking through the front door and foyer it almost felt like we were going back in time.  Entering the main seating area is a great mix of modern and vintage.  The space is open and airy, beautiful floors and simple, hip decorations.  Love the front counter and window counter too.   numnumnum."
5 star rating,"Pleasant shop, friendly staff.  My niece enjoyed the ""pepper steak"". Her portion was very large compared to our serviceable ""fried catfish"" with spinach and grits. Not in love, but I like the concept and I'm a big small business Detroit fan. I would try it again if I was in the area."
3 star rating,"Just pop in today for the first time.  Hit up (Inside 3rd) for lunch and drove to Detroit Vegan Soul to check it out.  I decided to try a cup (soup of the day).  Sorry to say the flavor could have been ok, but someone was heavy handed with the SALT!!  I had to send back with an apology and I orders the mac and cheese to go instead.  We ordered our after lunch dessert there instead.  (1) slice of carrot cake and (1) slice of Snicker Doodle Cake.  They were sinfully delish  :)  I'm not giving up on this place, we will be back next time for our full lunch and finish it off with your awesome cake.  Tried the mac and cheese later and it had a nice flavor / firm texture / not over salty but slight oily for me.  We are looking forward to visiting again in the near future.  Clean / friendly staff / nice layout / great selection"
3 star rating,"Yelp will not allow to give 0 stars.  I don't know where to start with this place; everything went wrong from the moment we walked in. I understand if there is some sort of convention in town and you get backed up, both front of house and back of house, but please be honest your customers. We waited a half an hour for a seat and were the only guests waiting. Fine, but tell us that your food may take over an hour once you order. We were finally  seated and ordered our food. Waiter finally says after a half hour that there was a yoga convention in town and food was taking longer than expected and your food should be out in 20 min. At this point the restaurant was only half full. So what really was the problem?  The waiter finally returned 20 mins later and I asked for him to see how much longer it would be. He returns about 5 mins later and says the fryer is broken and our food will be 25 more mins and if we our willing to wait it will be free. Hell no!We were looking forward to a great experience and We were severely let down. We will never return. Good luck."
1 star rating,My 1st vegan meal and it wasn't bad at all I had the burger and it was wonderful next I come I will get the meatloaf
4 star rating,"I hate to be a dissenting voice, but, I was disappointed.  It looks like problems with service is a common problem and that really overshadowed our experience.  It took over an hour to get our order 2 smoothies, okra stew and the catfish.  I can maybe understand the catfish taking longer, but smoothies and stew that I'm assuming is already made? It's really a bummer that they haven't figured out this side of things. My friend really liked the okra, the smoothies were good, the catfish, not so much.  The breading was really thick and hard and didn't have much flavor. The only thing I like about the dish were the sauteed greens, those were very good. I'll give it another try - I really want to like this place!"
3 star rating,"This place is a true gem! I love everything here. The staff is super friendly and I love the ambiance when dining in. Nothing compares, as Detroit Vegan Soul is the ONLY exclusively vegan restaurant in metro Detroit. Wish they had brunch on more days than just Sunday. Their tofu scramble is by far the best I've ever had!"
5 star rating,"We read about this restaurant in HOUR magazine and thought we would give it a try.  We came in at 11:00 when they opened, and the tables filled up fast. Our selections were the okra soup, spring rolls, and soul platter.  My wife and I both enjoyed the soup, as well as the rolls.  We split the platter as there was enough food for two on it. Everything here was great!  Service was fast, and the food was even better!  We were talking with the other guest and we were all sharing what thought about our selections and what to order next visit. We wish them much success here. Can't wait for our next visit!"
5 star rating,"For the last 3 years I've been a customer and have never had a bad experience until today.  I have no problem with the hour wait time, we put our name and number on the list, found something to do for a while and returned on our own (without a call).  The ""hostess"" tried seating 3 of us at a 2 top against the wall and I kindly asked for a 3rd chair because we would have been on top of each other and the woman next to us, she told me she didn't have any chairs and got a major attitude, she was completely put out by the question.  We decided to wait for seating for 3 and stood near the door.  When a table opened up she walked over very slowly and shuffled around even slower to get a rag, figure out where to put the dirty dishes, arrange placemats, etc.  We finally sat down and witnessed her whispering to other staff and looking at us.  I was upset and wanted to leave but my family wanted to stay, so I compromised and said we'd stay but if she would be the one waiting on us we were absolutely leaving, THANKFULLY she wasn't!  A nice gal that we usually get came over and took our order... but then she had to leave for some reason and the next server that we were supposed to have didn't come over for another 20 minutes!  We tried to get her attention several times for more water but to no avail.  Overall it was a very strange and off putting experience.  Negativity is contagious.  Happy customers leave excellent tips and return.  Your ""hostess"" needs intensive training on her customer service skills."
1 star rating,"Pretty good. Reliably good food: The potato salad is amazing, as is the greens. I just wIsh they would increase portions, expand the menu, and sell their barbecue sauce wholesale."
4 star rating,"I live in Alabama but I come to Detroit at least once or twice a quarter for business reasons.  I had been looking forward to visiting this restaurant for months. On my first visit I had mac n cheese, greens, and the tofu catfish.  Absolutely wonderful!  It was a take out order so I did not experience the terrible service that it seems to be known for.  I still recommended to two of my friends.My second visit was on a Sunday.  I called ahead as soon as my flight arrived in Detroit around 2:30 p.m.  I was told that they could not take a phone order because they were backed up but I might be served if I came in person.  I broke all kinds of speeding records and arrived at 3:20 p.m.  I seriously wanted some delicious vegan food!!!  I was turned away at the door and was told that they were not serving anymore customers period because they were backed up!  Of course, I was pissed!  I will give this restaurant only one more try!"
3 star rating,"Great food & good service. The collard green spring rolls are delicious! I usually cook vegan dishes at home, but I do not adhere to a strict vegan diet when I dine out. I've taken friends here who were not into the idea of vegan food and they have happily been converted. The location is small and cozy, but the bright green accents in the dining room give it a fun, vibrant feel. The bathrooms were very clean, but limited to one at a time. I would recommend this place to meat eaters and vegans alike!"
5 star rating,"What was all the hype about, I was not impressed with the food? The Restaurant was too tight, not comfortable, had to wait outside or near the window inside; I was summoned for seating.about thirty minutes later there was a seat available at the counter. My first time there, I ordered but didn't order the food that the previous customers who left the restaurant and was dissatisfied with their meal.  I thought they were just complaining; now I found out my selection wasn't good either. I won't be back because it wasn't all that."
2 star rating,Nice to have another vegan restaurant option in michigan. However celiacs beware. I ordered the gluten free sweet potatoe fries and i liked them . I told one of the owners that it was nice they put in a gluten free fryer and she did not know what i was talking about.I got a  feeling lots of cross contamination going on in the kitchen. If you are celiac probably best to stay away.
3 star rating,"My apologies to all the other fine vegan and vegetarian restaurants, past and present, that I have patronized, but this is my new favorite.  My first visit was Friday night.  My next visit was the night after.  My third was the next afternoon.  All told, I had 2 smoothies, 1 hot herbal tea, 4 meals, 1 appetizer/starter, 1 small cup of what one might consider tartar sauce, and 2 deserts.  The total number of food items, not including the drinks, was 16.  There was something about the coleslaw that didn't suit my tastes, and I only mention it, because it just doesn't seem fair that everything should be so perfect, or extremely close to it.The wait staff and owners are as great as the food.My third visit was with 2 friends, neither of whom are vegans or vegetarians.  Both of them want to come back next Sunday.I challenge anyone to find something that's less than amazing here.I've been back several times since my previous review, and while it's still my favorite, they changed some recipes.  The amazing sauce that they used for tartar sauce is now more like tartar sauces elsewhere.  The coleslaw changed to one that I like.The various cakes and muffins are by far the best anywhere.  I do have one issue.  Sometimes, someone in the kitchen is a little heavy handed with the salt shaker."
5 star rating,"Excellent vegan food!! Everyone raves about the mac and cheese but I adored the ""catfish"" tofu sandwich. The redskin potato disks it came with we're perfect & the side salad was fresh. Our waitress, Taylor, was ultra friendly and helpful. Their smoothies are delicious and the vegan German chocolate cake was awesome."
5 star rating,"Went to DVS today for Sunday brunch. There was no line so that was nice, but that was probably the only nice part- that and the coffee... I ordered the tofu catfish and polenta grits. My girlfriend had the biscuits and gravy. Neither dishes were spiced properly or had a presentation other than blah. The biscuits were rubbery and tasted like a Nerf ball and the gravy was watery and tasted like chicken noodle soup. The catfish tofu was ok but just tasted like I could buy this at whole foods frozen section. The grits tasted like the instant grits my mom use to make. And the side of greens were nothing special. The biscuits and gravy was the most shocking. The chief either didn't understand vegans or proper soul food ( I think both) I'm sorry but it felt like someone's attempt to make vegan food who had no experience . For soul food or southern biscuits it's not that hard. I'm a white 27 year old from Redford and have made better vegan biscuits and gravy for a fraction of the price. This tasted like a cheap coney islands breakfast at best . I had high expectations but was disappointed . There was a wait for bigger parties and I felt bad they didn't have coffee or water out there , someone should spend a week in Portland to see how to do a proper brunch . I'm not giving it 1 star cause the service and coffee was fast and good. But food was 1*"
2 star rating,"The food was awesome,  but the service was the worst.I'm giving it a high ranking in hopes that the kitchen will get it's act in order.  I don't get what the issue was.   They had 5 folks in the kitchen and I could see they were all working hard,  but no food was coming out.   The night we went, we were the only table that got served.(after more then an hour)  Everyone else bailed due to the long wait.But,  the food was so good that it was worth it!   Please fix the kitchen!  I want to be a regular,  but I can't take that wait!"
5 star rating,"Just ate at DVS for the first time this weekend even though I've been dying to try it since they opened.  It did not disappoint!  I had the seitan pepper steak w/ mac and cheese and collard greens and added cornbread.  It was superb!  The mac and cheese was creamy with just enough ""grease factor"" to make it comfort food without being unappealing.  The seitan was perfectly cooked and so tender it would've ""fallen off the bone"" if it were an animal flesh.  My hubby had the soul platter and raved about the collard greens and mac and cheese as well.  The sweet tea was excellent and we capped it off with a banana nut muffin, which was the most moist muffin we've ever had.  We'd definitely go back for the fried tofu ""catfish"" and more mac and cheese.  Loved the decor - simple and clean and uplifting and just an all around cozy little space.  So glad DVS opened and hoping they thrive!"
5 star rating,"This place was really impressive small but the atmosphere was welcoming,the purified water on table was a nice touch, I ordered the soul platter with was greens , cornbread,Mac&cheese,beans &rice everything was really impressive including the Carob Cookies!"
4 star rating,Very nice small restaurant in the middle of Indian village. Very clean inside and friendly staff that made you feel welcome. Fast service. Had the vegan tofu bites that were out of this world  and the okra stew that was pretty good. Ican't wait to go back!
4 star rating,"I have been following the progress of Detroit Vegan Soul via social media and eagerly awaited the opening of a permanent location so that I could try the food. I was not disappointed. The food delivered on every level. I ordered carry out - the Soul Food platter and the Tofu Catfish dinner. The food was perfectly seasoned and cooked, the mac and cheese was the best vegan version I've eaten and rivals what I remember of dairy mac and cheese. The tofu catfish was crispy and flavorful. However, as others have noted the wait time was long. In spite of the long wait (which I believe they will improve) I will definitely return to this restaurant. It is a nice location and the food is great! I have plans to try everything on the menu."
4 star rating,"Wish I could give 2 different ratings...One for the food and one for the service/wait time.  We went the 2nd day they were open about 12:40pm.  Breakfast is served until 2pm on Sunday, which was a bit of a disappointment, but we were very excited to try the food and really didn't care that much.  Took too long to get menus, took too long to get water, which while we were there almost 2 hours, we kept having to request more of.  One coffee refill for the entire time were were there...not good.  Finally the food comes out, well, 1/2 of it.  Granted were were a group of 10, but we waited over 35 minutes for 5 breakfast plates to come out.  1/2 way through that wait time were were told they were out of the potato option and we had to get grits, which was fine.  Those of us who got our food patiently waited for the rest of the table. 5 min, 10 mi...forget it, our food is getting cold so we eat.  We completely finish our food and the rest of our table is still waiting for their pancakes, yes you heard correctly, we were waiting for an hour for 5 orders of pancakes.  In about 10 minute intervals the pancakes come out.  Meanwhile they are serving other tables before they finish serving us.  Food is good,...very good, but the kitchen needs to get themselves together and get the food out in a timely manner.  We will be back to give them a second try since their catfish sandwich just made Detroit's top 10!"
3 star rating,"We drove from Ann Arbor to Detroit Vegan Soul on Friday night during rush hour.  Once we were inside the restaurant, we quickly forgot about the traffic.  The food was delicious, especially the Soul Food Platter.  The macaroni and cheese was the creamiest and most authentic vegan version I have ever had.  The cornbread is dense, moist and flavorful.  The collards are so well seasoned they make you happy to eat your greens.  The atmosphere is warm and relaxing.  I especially love the orange chair in the entry and the art by a Detroit artist.  All employees were  kind, attentive and welcoming.  We will definitely be back!"
5 star rating,"Detroit Vegan Soul was great. I am a meat eater who is vegetarian friendly. But for my personal taste, vegan is too extreme and what I've had previously has underwhelmed me. I went into this cafe skeptical but left incredibly satisfied. The soul platter was delicious- how did they make that Mac & ""cheese"" so tasty and creamy?? I could have sworn the collard greens had some hamhock in there the way they tasted. I hope they succeed. It's a wonderfully unique offering and the food and service were actually good."
4 star rating,"I have also been a long time fan of DVS since discovering their amazing food during the catering and pop-up phase. Not only is the food absolutely delicious (on top of being healthy!), but the owners and staff are incredibly kind and genuine people. This makes for an all around exceptional experience.Moreover, the turn out on the grand opening speaks only to the enthusiasm of the many people who have supported and awaited the unveiling of the storefront restaurant. Any reviewer who is critical of the experience on this day clearly had no concept of the impressive following this company has gathered on a beautiful journey. CONGRATULATIONS to Detroit Vegan Soul for opening a beautiful restaurant with incredible service and unbelievably delicious food!! I can't wait to come back soon and often!!"
5 star rating,"Yummy food, very flavorful. I had the Mac and cheese, the bottom burnt but the rest was creamy. Catfish tofu sandwich was great."
5 star rating,"The restaurant has blown my mind! When I even walked up to the restaurant I couldn't help but think this place is so cute! You immediately get this calming vibe from it. The vibe you read from the outside is very close to what it was on the inside. The ambiance was stellar from the mood of my server to the set up of the restaurant. Next, the food...I ordered the sweet potato chips as an appetizer which came with a dipping sauce. Even though the chips were not as crisp as I had hoped they were still tasty. As my main dish I ordered the Seitan Pepper Steak, it was absolutely delicious! I never expected it to taste just like steak. Now we have dessert, I ordered the Gluten Free Vanilla cupcake. This was the only thing I was not impressed with. I always eat vegan gluten free cupcakes so i know the potential and this dessert did not meet the standard. It was dry and the icing was not very good(hard to explain). Lastly the audience they attract is very diverse and you could never go wrong with diversity. Overall my experience was an A-. Compared to many places similar to DVS this one wins because I felt like I belonged & the people were nice."
5 star rating,This is a small but cozy place to dine. I'm a vegetarian and would never find a decent veg burger anywhere!! Had the DVS burger here and am truly blown away!  It is really good. Their menu is limited but I guess that's what helps them keep better focus on quality.
5 star rating,"This place was very, very special on so many levels. It was my first trip to Detroit and I found this restaurant on Yelp. One of the six of us was vegan and we try to find a vegan restaurant for him when we go out together. I've had very, very good vegan soul food before -- in Oakland -- so I had high expectations. I was completely blown away. All of our food was incredibly flavorful and delicious. You didn't feel like you were missing out on anything by eating here. Our server was very sweet, attentive, knowledgeable and excited about the food. The atmosphere was casual, relaxed, bright and welcoming. The icing on the cake was when one of the owners came out to introduce herself and thank us for coming. It was then I learned it is locally-owned by an African American lesbian couple. Why not give it five stars then? It's a personal thing. I personally discount any review that's five stars (or one star for that matter) because no place is perfect -- or that bad. In my book, this is my highest rating and the fact that I took the time to write this review says volumes. If you are in Detroit and considering eating here, DO IT. I promise you will NOT be disappointed."
4 star rating,"Excruciatingly Slow..............Excruciatingly long to have our order taken and for anything edible to arrive!!Now on to the food. Not much food for the money but I was expecting that so not a real problem. BBQ Tofu; sauce was good, tofu was dry. My son's fiancée had the tempeh dinner and it looked juicy and awesome. The best part of my meal was the curry flavored potato salad.I won't be back."
1 star rating,"Food was very tasty but it took a long time. Veggies were cold, and portions were very small for the price."
3 star rating,We came here last summer and I still think about the orca stew often. So delicious. Our family is back in the area and I cannot wait to go back. My mouth is watering...
5 star rating,"In all fairness - I am not writing about the food here, rather the customer service (or lack thereof).  We were looking for a place to eat in Detroit and found long lines in Midtown.  Looking for vegetarian fare, we called Detroit Vegan Soul to check out their seating situation.  We were told to come right over, yes there were seats in the restaurant for a group of 3 people.  When we arrived about 10 minutes later, there were about 12 seats in the place, but not 3 together.  It would have meant moving a table slightly, adding a chair, or allowing us to sit at the bar, get a drink and order food while waiting for a table to clear.  But the hostess (who was completely non-apologetic) would not make any accommodations and told us it would be a 20-30 minute wait to sit down. By the way, there is no where to really wait in the restaurant, and it was a cold night.  The hostess was quite curt, almost rude, then turned her back on us and walked away.My son has eaten at this restaurant and enjoyed it, so we thought to give it a try.  Based on our experience, I will find somewhere else to eat healthy foods. We will not be back."
1 star rating,"The okra stew was well season, and the stir fry seemed as if i was eating meat but it did not. The fry patatoes, nothing was over season or too spicy .the strawberry cobbler with vegan ice cream was great."
5 star rating,"Wow. This place is good. We tired the black eyed peas humus,  tofu catfish, smothered tempeh and coleslaw.  Everything was fresh and yummy.  A nice spot too!"
5 star rating,"SO DELICIOUS. It's a bit pricey, but definitely worth it (especially in this area). I ate pretty much a four course meal just because everything was so tasty. And I love that they're off the beaten path."
5 star rating,I recently started a fast and can't have any dairy or meat. This place is gods gift to me. The food makes me forget that I am even on a fast. Everything was great. The food is a little pricey for the portion but everything is delicious. indeed!
4 star rating,"Very good balance of flavor and texture. Friendly staff, small but clean and relaxed. Some dishes are better than others, but everything we tried was yummy. It's very busy, so you will wait, but it's worth it if you're not in a hurry. The mac and cheese is amazing! The dishes are a little pricey, so I'm not sure if we can go back as often as we would like, but I feel like if they could get more established then maybe they could balance out the price break. It's worth supporting and very good food."
4 star rating,"This was our first trip to Detroit. We read a great review on Detroit Vegan Soul in an article on the NY Times and made sure we were in town in time for dinner there. It was amazing. The greetings were warm and welcoming and the food was spectacular. (Those collard greens!) The owners each came over to welcome us and to make sure we were pleased. They're a sweet couple, focused on making beautiful food in a beautiful space. We cannot wait to go back. Also, we stayed at Honor & Folly in Corktown. It's an incredible space!"
4 star rating,"This food is amazing. I grew up in Compton, eating soul food and of course because it's LA county I've head my share of vegan food but this concept is great and they have really delivered on the being a soul food joint with the lucky benefit of being vegan fresh. I love any person place or thing that breaks preconceived ideas of what something or some is suppose to be like. This place is a game changer in the food world. From the moment you walk in you feel welcomed with  there large windows looking out to this hip neighborhood. Such friendly service cool and I'm tellin ya this food was great. I loved it so much I came yesterday and today, yeah .... back to back! I loved  the catfish& the pepper steak is amazing!! I also had the Dvs burger no lettuce with the works so so good!! Collard greens.  MAC&chesse!! Was on point!!!! The green smoothie was amazing and you can't go wrong with Eli's amazing teas! Those teas are the best and that another review within itself. SO YES this place is a gem!!!!"
5 star rating,"Friendly staff but even better FOOD :) ANY where i can get vegan or veggie dishes i am happy but this lace is a go-to !!! Highly recommend. ""gravy"" and green beans = MHMMMM good stuff !! Comfort food i can actually eat."
5 star rating,"Given that the Midwest is not known for vegetarian food let alone vegan options, Detroit surprised me with this little gem.  I am from the South, a vegetarian, and I live in NYC, so I was surprised when I typed in vegetarian restaurants and Detroit in Google, and DVS came up.  Overall, it was excellent.  I had the collard and bean soup, and catfish tofu sandwich.  Both dishes were superb!  Really great tasting vegan food is hard to make; even the best vegan restaurants in NYC have their ""bad"" dishes, so having only visited DVS once, I can't attest to other things on the menu.  That stated, it is important to note that for business travelers like myself who are vegetarian and would prefer to always eat vegan on the road, this is a great option.  Additionally, it was great to see a mixed clientele, not just typical tattooed hipsters.  With severe health problems like diabetes and high blood pressure affecting the African-American community, it's great to know DVS caters to this population as well.  As a side note, the establishment is great.  I read one review that mentioned the neighborhood was ""sketchy.""  Umm.  No.  It's Detroit, not West Hollywood, but this neighborhood is a far cry from sketchy.  Overall, I loved this place.  Great food, great vibe, very welcoming!"
5 star rating,"Brought my son who is looking to move back to Detroit from Brooklyn, and we both loved the vibe of this place and the neighborhood. West Village has a community feel and Detroit Vegan Soul certainly adds to it, with the friendly staff and comfortable urban feel of the space. The food is supremely fresh and flavorful - we are both meat-eaters and loved it! He had the millet burger and I the Coconut bacon BLT. We also had delicious veggie noodle and okra soup. The place was very busy on the Friday afternoon before Christmas. Well worth the visit and we will be back!"
5 star rating,"So excited to go back to this place. Everything I ate there was fantastic. The catfish tofu sandwich was especially divine. I also tasted my friend's spinach lasagna, and it was great. The hibiscus punch was a lovely, sweet treat. The service was really slow, but I'm not taking a star away for that--we went the second day they were open, and the place was absolutely booming. Great stuff!"
5 star rating,"I checked out this place with my Mother who heard about the place on TV. We went on the Friday of the Memorial Day weekend. It was not clear where we should park but we found a space on the street. Since we were not familiar with vegan food we ordered the Soul platters which were really good. I was surprised after the meal I was full. We felt there needed to be a little more salt or seasoning for the greens and the black eyed peas. The only real complaint was the service seemed a little slow and disorganized, but there was only one waitress. The place is not very large but it was full and I guess they were not ready for a dinner rush. The waitress did not tell us they were out of a soup and the drinks were brought later during the meal. But everyone who worked there was nice and made sure things were fine. I would go back but maybe when things are less hectic. I would like to try those other dishes."
4 star rating,"Coming from a foodie that is no where near being vegan I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here. I was with my wife and family so I was able to try several items and all were very delicious. We went on a Friday evening around 6-630 and there were only a few others  dining. It was really starting to fill up as we left. The collard green spring roll appetizers were amazing, so crispy and the collards were nice and smokey. The coconut fake bacon wrap was very unique and tasty. Service was great/  Two thumbs up from this non-vegetarian."
4 star rating,i have peaked. the catfish sandwich is great. no matter what u get u neeeeed to add a side of mac and cheese. 10/10.
5 star rating,"Great sides, especially the collard greens. Very creative meals. Carob cake was awesome. The food took a little while to arrive though."
5 star rating,My fiancé and I woke up craving vegan. We have been to DVS a few times so we knew what to expect but this time was by far the best. The service (Morgan) was so delightful. The green life smoothie - delicious. We ordered the tempeh collards red beans and rice cat fish broccoli kale and it was all amazing. Im writing this and getting hungry all over again. Looks like it will be Sunday Brunch today at DVS. Twice in a week. Good job DVS. 5 stars!!
4 star rating,"Had lunch here for the first time last week and was kind of disappointed. Although the food was well flavored, nothing was exciting and there was too much grease. The server didn't seem to know much about the menu and it had a chaotic feeling however I'm willing to give it another chance."
3 star rating,"Awesome, awesome, awesome restaurant. Amazing food and fantastic servers. I have been here multiple times and cannot wait to return. I keep saying I am going to try something different but cannot get past the soul food platter... it's Heaven on a plate! Their desserts are TO DIE FOR! If you have not been....GO! These ladies know what they are doing with food and it shows in EVERY bite!"
5 star rating,Really good vegan that would convince a non-vegan to give it a try. Friendly service.
5 star rating,"The food here is great for vegans and non-vegans alike! I love the green smoothie, tempeh burger and coconut wrap. The only thing keeping me from a five star rating is the wait time. The first time I went, the wait was really long, although there weren't many people there. The second time I went, the wait time improved somewhat, so I'm hopeful that things are improving. The staff are all very nice and the place is cute. I'm so happy to have a restaurant in the neighborhood - I hope they do well and will be coming back!"
4 star rating,"I came in for a carryout during a busy dinner rush. They had my order ready in about 10 minutes. The food was excellent, one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had!"
5 star rating,"Heard so much about this place I had to visit.  I got the BBQ tofu platter.  The tofu was disappointingly rubbery but the sauce was tasty. The corn on the cob was not on the cob and just average corn.  The kale and potato salad were both absolutely outstanding.  Ordering carry out online didn't work each time I tried it and when I tried to phone an order in they said I couldn't do that either.  The website said that was a policy during Lent and Lent is over so I don't get it.  It was annoying to have to go in person and then stand around and wait when they were not even  that busy.  I will definitely be going back in spite of that, I will just avoid the tofu and load up on the heavenly sides."
4 star rating,"I've been a fan of Detroit Vegan Soul since it was merely a pop-up. I'm vegan and Detroit Vegan Soul is the only vegan restaurant in Detroit, making it one of my favorite restaurants. I've been here numerous times with varying experiences- ranging from really good to average. The food: I have to admit I've enjoyed everything I've tried on the menu. The ones that stand out to me are the Southern Fried Tofu (both appetizer and sandwich), Catfish Tofu, and the DVS Burger. The DVS Burger is honestly my favorite, though I'm not a burger person at all. I hated burgers growing up and even after becoming vegetarian and later vegan, I was never a fan of any type of burger. However, this burger is AMAZING. I only tried it after my friend who ordered it told me to try hers and it's been my favorite thing on the menu since. The only other thing that sticks out to me on the menu is the Seitan Pepper Steak, which I remember being good, but a little overwhelming in flavor. The atmosphere: I think the restaurant is cute and simple. It's small inside, but not too crowded. It's always clean and set up really nice. I often find some vegetarian/vegan restaurants to be sometimes a little messy inside, but DVS doesn't have that issue at all. And West Village is a great neighborhood. I'm happy to see businesses opening up here and succeeding!The price: it's a little overpriced for what you get. I understand that their ingredients are organic and unique, but a lot of the servings are a little bit expensive for what you get. I've had friends who I've gone with (who are not vegan) say that they're not full after the meal and to me, if you pay for a $9-$14 meal, you should be pretty full afterward, but that's not always the case here.The service: The service is probably the worst thing about this restaurant. While the wait-staff is always friendly and accommodating, I almost always have issues with the service. First, the meal wait time is either hit or miss. I've gotten my meal sometimes 20 minutes after I've ordered it and other times, I've had to wait over an hour for an appetizer. Most times that I've been there, there have only been 3-4 other groups there maximum, so I can't believe that it's because they're super busy. One time, I ordered an appetizer to hold me over until the meal came out, but they brought the appetizer out with the meal (after an hour waiting for both!), defeating the whole purpose of the appetizer. I often see the wait staff waiting around by the counter for the meals to come out, leading me to believe there may be a miscommunication between them and cooking staff. I'm not sure. I've also had times when I order a meal and the table next to me will order similar things and get their food much quicker than I have. Lastly, I want to point out that the last two times I've been here, I've been finishing my meal, when the waiter or waitress will take away my unfinished food. These have been different wait-staff too! I'm usually a pretty fast eater, but sometimes I like to take my time and it honestly make me feel like they're trying to get me out of the restaurant, which is kind of insulting. Overall, I love this place and if they improved their service and improved their food to price ratio, this could be my favorite restaurant. I definitely recommend it to everyone- omnivores to vegetarians to vegans."
4 star rating,Let me state that while I don't eat pork or beef I do eat chicken and fish and am not a vegan. My wife and I had lunch at Vegan Soul today and EVERYTHING I had was delicious! The tempeh smothered in gravy with green beans and potatoes was so good I finished the meal in about five minutes! I then had some strawberry cobbler which was also excellent. Honestly I didn't know vegan food could be so good. That meal could have been served to a meat lover anywhere and they would have liked it. The service was excellent and the resturaunt  was in a very quaint lovely and safe feeling neighborhood. You owe it to yourself whether you are vegan or not to try this place and the owner told us of a second location opening soon in Rosedale Park. We will be going to Vegan Soul again!!!!!!!
5 star rating,"This place is amazing...very clean, friendly, peaceful, well run, and the food is excellent.  We had the catfish tofu and the philly sandwich along with a strawberry shake and all were exceptional.  The location is super easy to get to and street parking was available right out front. These folks are doing a great job serving tasty food, that's also healthy!  Can't wait to go back!"
5 star rating,"I literally just got back from eating here and had to give it a review.If I could, I would give Detroit Vegan Soul a 3.5 out of 5. Their food is amazing and very well prepared! However, like other people stated, their service is on the slow side. At certain points I was afraid that they forgot I was sitting there. Also, some of the items on the menu seemed a bit over priced, but others were OK. What do you expect with fresh organic food though?In all, I would definitely eat here again because the food is so good.. but I could see them losing a lot of business because of their slow service. I was lucky because I had a long lunch break, but what if I didn't?Whatever the case, I suggest trying it."
4 star rating,"I went for Sunday breakfast and had the breakfast sandwich.  AMAZING.  I have never had vegan breakfast patties that tasted so good.  Excellent service, awesome food and a good value.  I will definitely go again."
5 star rating,"Great Food. Feels great to support a business run by black Detroit Natives (yay!) Great food, healthy options. The dessert are also delicious. Service is spectacular, even when they are busy. The agave Ginger beer was refreshing and healthy and I loved the yams and tofu catfish bites. Wonderful option in a nice location."
5 star rating,"Today I invited my dearest sweetest friend to lunch at Detroit Vegan Soul for her Birthday.  And we traveled way across town because I wanted her to experience what I had the first time I came. I knew she would love it and she did.  So much so...lol, as we ate, we were planning what we were going to try at our next visit.  I loved it even more than I did the first time I came.  I had the DVS millet burger. Oh My Goodness and I do mean Goodness. I was full by half the burger but I promise you I wanted another one. The word delicious just doesn't do that burger justice. I can hardly wait til my next visit and that will be sooner than later.  Good, Good, Good!!!!"
5 star rating,I convinced a wonderful dear friend of mines to come and enjoy a Vegan meal with me. ....much to my surprise I believe I enjoyed it more than He. It was by far the best Vegan(Soulful food)EVER!!!! The Okra Stew was absolutely Wonderful. ...Thank you ladies....I'm encouraging everyone I know to try and be quick about it.
5 star rating,Vegan or not this place is delicious!!! Even the cobbler and pastries! Love it!
5 star rating,Wow. The level of kitchen competence here is impressive. We ate off the brunch menu: chicken fried tofu nuggets--amazing. This former southern boy found the grits to be best in class.  Sweet potato pancakes: OMG. Only miss was the waffles. Go here.
5 star rating,"I was really excited to try this place! Saw the website, love the concept behind it. And there is a lot of potential. Went there on Friday. The server was very friendly and overall the service was great. My companion and I got the collard green spring rolls, tofu ""catfish"", and soul platter to share.The spring rolls were ok but plain. Literally just collard greens inside spring roll wrappers. The vegan mac n cheese and yams were my favorite things. Also the snicker doodle cake was quite moist and tasty. Everything else was plain and lacking flavor. Undercooked potatos and large chunks of plain brocolli did not add much to the (also rather plain) tofu ""catfish"" nuggets. The rice and beans were ok but didn't have much flavor and the corn bread was dry. Overall, glad I tried it and I would love to see the place succeed. I think the food could be improved though."
3 star rating,"On my first visit, I ordered a la carte; greens, mashed potatoes and yam.  Also tried the tropical smoothie and red velvet cupcake.  The taste of the yams were not what I'm used too.  It is an acquired taste however everything else I tried was very tasty and I would definitely come back."
4 star rating,"We came here for lunch, hungry after a morning paddle thru Belle Isle's canals and were rewarded with the best veggie burgers we have ever had! We were also. Impressed with the friendly service and neighborhood vibe."
5 star rating,"I was in from out of town and couldn't find many Vegan friendly restaurants.  I was so so happy to find Detroit Vegan Soul. There are so many good things to say about this place. The staff are really friendly, the food is great and incredibly hearty.  I ended up eating here for the last few meals I had in Detroit. It basically made my trip. Higly recommend it."
5 star rating,"I ate here on a Sunday morning with three omnivores and one vegetarian. It wasn't  overly busy so we got seated right away. Two of us had the ""catfish"" tofu, grits and sauteed spinach - and we loved them. I have a tenuous relationship with tofu, but this if the first time I have ever if had it that it almost sang. The crust on the tofu was deliciously flavorful & crusty and the tofu was firm enough and had a good texture. It did what tofu done well does -  absorb the flavor. The dill tarter sauce was really divine. I normally despise dairy based tarter sauce - so this was a revelation to me! The grits were creamy and very tasty - and the spinach was tasty too. The fresh fruit was banana, kiwi, strawberry and blueberry - all fresh and good. One other friend enjoyed the oatmeal and the other liked the breakfast sandwich: Pan fried tofu, veggie sausage on cinnamon raisin toast. Three of us are tea drinkers and liked the selections offered. The service was great as well. We'll be going back again soon. We can't wait to see the neighborhood flourish."
4 star rating,"Me and my friend came here on a Saturday afternoon in July... wasn't too busy and we got seated right away. But then again our food probably took 20 mins to come out. We waited a long time for food when we wanted to be in and out. The place is super small, very hole-in-the-wall feel to it. Cute though. Our food was average though. Nothing too special... just mediocre. I got the dvs burger with a side of spinach salad and housemade coleslaw. The burger to bun ratio was off. Way more bun than burger, although the flavor of the burger was good. The spinach salad it came with was probably 15 leaves of spinach and 1 cherry tomato cut in half--super small. Coleslaw was good but very small too. My friend got the soul platter (mind you this is one of their popular items) and she said it was very bland, other than the maple yams. She had to add a lot of salt and other than that, she was not satisfied. You'd think for a well-known soul food place you'd feel satisfied... your SOUL would feel satisfied. But nope, not satisfied. Food was meh and overpriced."
3 star rating,"Disappointed with the wait time. Went to the Grand Opening of their restaurant in West Village today (they opened at 3pm). I came around 6pm, waited in line until 6:30pm, finally gave my order to the cashier, he advised that it would take 40 minutes to cook my carry out (2 soul food platters and a BBQ Tofu sandwich), so I patiently waited until 7:30pm. Then an announcement was made to the entire restaurant that the soul food platter was sold out and we had to choose 3 other platters instead (none of which I really wanted, but I heard were good). I really didn't want to wait wait another 40 to 50 minutes for them to prepare different meals, because I was pretty tired sitting for 1 1/2 hours, so I asked for my money back and left. I'll probably wait a while before I go back, maybe when the crowds die down a little, when soul food platters are available consistently, and their timing with preparing the meals is better. The Grand Opening atmosphere itself was nice with the DJ and the singers, but I'll have to come another time."
3 star rating,"I preface this by saying I have already been a fan of DVS from when they had their daily deliveries or were at a pop-up. I'm glad they have a permanent spot and think they will be a great addition to the food scene in Detroit. Though I only attended their ""soft opening"" with a limited menu, the Seitan Pepper Steak was delicious. Their space is very attractive. You don't have to be vegan to enjoy the food. Imagine that!"
5 star rating,"Every detail is thought of at this restaurant.  I am vegan and travel extensively - always looking for excellent vegan restaurants.  The major cities have them (NY, LA, SF, Chicago) and now we can include Detroit Vegan Soul as one of them.  I took my teenager daughter, who is not vegan, and she loved it as well.  Their philosophy on ingredients is right on (would like to see them source locally more if possible), the people care - and in the hospitality business when they care it usually translates into the care they put into their cooking.  Wonderful, laid back vibe in the space.  The understudied logo on the corners of the tables is a nice touch.  I highly recommend.  I am from the Detroit area and this will become a regular spot for me."
5 star rating,"I had the pleasure of eating at this wonderful establishment on 1/04/2014 and 1/05/2014. The food was so good I had to come back for seconds. I love the decor, the staff was very nice and pleasant and the restaurant was very clean. On my first visit, I had the Seitan Pepper Steak with sesame broccoli on the side. The seitan was very tender, the seasoning was perfect with the rice. I love the steamed sesame broccoli,. I had Southern Fried Tofu bites and they were incredible. The tofu bites had so much flavor and was so crispy, the sauce was a great compliment to the bites, which was also very good. I  had lemon pound cake, which was so delicious that I wished I had gotten an extra slice. On my next visit which was the next day, yes the food is that good. I had Smothered Tempeh with mac-n-cheese and collard greens. Once again, everything was very good, well seasoned and cooked to perfection. I had chocolate cake, which was very delicious. This was my first time eating at a vegan restaurant and I'm glad that it was Detroit Vegan Soul. Thank-you to the staff for doing an awesome job and making vegan food delicious. I look forward to trying everything on the menu!"
5 star rating,"I was so excited to try DVS but really was so  disappointed.  I ordered the ""soul platter"" and literaly I felt like it was left overs that were heated up in the microwave for $14.   The portion of the vegan mac and cheese was good but very small.  The collard greens and yams were nothing to rave about, the corn muffin was dry and very small."
1 star rating,"Excellent! Nice, clean decor and friendly staff. I had the seitan pepper steak with mac and cheese and steamed kale and everything was very good. I also would recommend the smothered tempeh and the smoky-flavored greens. The lemon poundcake is one of the best vegan desserts I've ever had. Detroit Vegan Soul is a mandatory stop and I can't wait to eat there again."
5 star rating,Simply excellent. Came here for breakfast and got the breakfast platter. I don't like tofu but their tofu scramble was excellent. Nothing was even at or below par. Will visit again.
5 star rating,"Awesome neighborhood spot. I had the ""catfish"" sandwich and was honestly expecting just fried tofu sticks in a sandwich. It tasted like a catfish sandwich though! The texture is obviously different since it's tofu and not actually fish but damn. My wife had the sampler platter (can't remember what it is called). I tried some of her greens. Very good and smoky. Detroit vegans and vegetarians : go here."
5 star rating,"Went a couple weekends ago with my mom on a Saturday afternoon. We went around 1pm, so it looked like we had just missed the crowd, but every table was taken.  Luckily the counter at the window was open, so we sat right down.  The waitress was super nice and came right over to greet us.  It took us a little while to decide what to order, she checked on us a couple times, never rushed us and noticed when we started looking around that we were finally ready to order and came right over.  I really liked that.  What I did not like was how long it took to get our food.  It took a good 30 minutes from when we ordered to when we got our food.  We ordered the ""Catfish"" tofu sandwich with redskin potato rounds and coleslaw, and the Grilled tempeh wrap with sweet potato chips and spinach salad.  The sandwiches were delicious!  I imagined I was actually eating a fish sandwich.  The redskin potatoes had good flavor, but could have been a little crispier for my liking.  Was expecting the sweet potato ""chips"" to be more chip like, but they were a bit soft so a little disappointing.  The salad and coleslaw were typical, nothing to write home about.  They lost the one star for the long wait for the food and the sweet potato chips being a little below par.  I will probably be back again, though, to try something else on the menu since the sandwiches were very tasty."
4 star rating,"Delicious.  Very impressed with overall experience.  Wait staff was friendly, but not overly so.  Simple, charming decor.  The soul food platter was really yummy - especially the Mac and cheese.  We drove in from Plymouth to check out this Vegan restaurant, and can't wait to go back."
5 star rating,"Food is excellent, service is great.  I had the smothered tempeh and it was great and my husband loved the bbq  tofu. We will definitely be back!"
