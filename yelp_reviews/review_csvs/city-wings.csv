8/1/2019,5 star rating,"The wings were delicious and everything came hot. I rested the dinner with fries and mac as sides. The lemonade was good and the cherry was a nice surprise. The pie was pretty good as well. Service was great!Despite the 79 health score, I gave them a try.  They did not disappoint, however, I hope they increase their score as it could be discouraging for some."
9/14/2021,5 star rating,"Great, Quick service'. Carry out only for Covid!  These are small, best tasting wings I have ever eaten!  I had Special 17, normal plain version very tasty!  Mild Buffalo yummy, mango hot great!  Their side dishes all homemade, and delicious!  Potato salad, beans, Mac & cheese!  I will order again!!!!"
4/28/2021,3 star rating,Ordered food with coworkers for lunch. I chose the Wing Ding Dinner Parmesan/ Garlic with Mac and Cheese with string beans. Overall my food experience was positive. The wings were flavored nicely. Unfortunately the Mac and Cheese was not. Plenty of Mac but NO flavor or cheese flavor at all. Huge miss. The string beans were ok with a Spicey after bite.Please update your pricing on your menu. It makes for a bad experience both ways when you think you are paying one price only to find out it's much more than what you thought. I will possibly try again if given the opportunity.
9/24/2021,5 star rating,"Absolutely delicious wings, delivered the right way. Ask for the snack attack flavor 17!! You will not be disappointed"
3/17/2022,2 star rating,I placed a pickup order online and went to get it at the time indicated on my email confirmation. When I got there I had to wait 20 minutes for my order. Disorganized and unprofessional. Now my clothes stink of grease after having to wait!
10/24/2020,5 star rating,"I get the Chicken Wing Dinner here about once a week. City Wings has, in my opinion, the best wings in the city and I've gone out of my way to try as many wings places as possible. Lemon Pepper is my absolute favorite and it's a must try. Staff is always very kind to me, even when they are clearly overwhelmed with orders at times because the popularity of the wings. I love this place. Absolute must try restaurant in Detroit."
9/25/2021,5 star rating,Only place I'll drive 15 minutes for some wings. I always get Cajun wings and Parmesan fries.
3/23/2021,1 star rating,Phone ordering doesn't exist. Seasoned these small amish wings like they're whole wings.
4/19/2019,5 star rating,Still as good as ever. Although I think over the years the wings have gotten smaller. They flavor is there we came in for a snack this afternoon on a Friday. Red beans and rice were gone already... waaa waaa waaa! I opted for the med spice and he got mango garlic ginger. They use like a dry rub with LOTS of flavor. My lips nicely on fire. The potato salad and green beans were good too
10/20/2014,5 star rating,"Mmm Mmm good. Traveling all the time nice to find this place. It's across from the hospital. If I didn't have my yelp app on my phone I may have missed it. Inside is a spacoius eating  establishment. Don't let the outside fool ya! No waffles at this time. He said he is working  on sweet potatoe waffles maybe in the nxt yr. Hubby and I shared 20 wings, med & spicey pepper ginger were a nice eve snack. Potatoe salad was da bomb! Nice Vegis for crunch and not overloaded with mayo. We were looking for Grumpy Tea (unsweetened ) but he assured us his sweet green tea  was not a sugar overload. He was right and took a bit of fire from my mouth!! Nice guy ( and family business) very clean place , good food. Looking forward to next time. Great job!!"
7/19/2019,4 star rating,"Pros- best wings I've had in awhile !! I love smaller wings (not those large hormone filled nasty tasting wings most have) and the dry rub has a great intense flavor. I got the medium (glad the staff recommended i didn't get HOT , cuz that would have been overkill) These were fresh and tasted great , oh and the ranch was good ranch too. Sides were good and homemade. I'll have to come back to try more flavors :) Cons- Price and meal deals are higher than expected , especially for the area and its surroundings... $2.00 extra charge for all flats ?? Why , it's the same chicken , doesn't cost you more.  Also .50 for Ranch or Blue Cheese?!It's standard to get one sauce side free with wing order."
4/23/2021,5 star rating,"So many flavors to choose from and staff is always friendly.  Food is really good and nice selection of sides from fries, chili, and red beans and rice. Of course they have the staples mac & cheese and greens.  One of my favorite spots."
7/23/2019,5 star rating,"Jesus Christ. Best wings ever. I eat so many wings so I have a good understand of what a good wing is. These are perfectly cooked. They put just the right about of sauce on. Flavors are really good. I always get the spicy bbq wings if you're wondering which ones to get. However there are some things to consider: You have to get an order of 20 wings of more for a second wing flavor, the prices here are more expensive than what you would usually find, and also the wings are also very small. All things considered this is one of my favorite wing places. 5 stars. Lovely."
6/14/2019,3 star rating,"I have to give a 3 because of how hit or miss the wings are. Sometimes the wings are big and juicy and Some times they're tiny and dry. When they are good it's 5 stars, when bad it's a 1. That said, the flavors are all great and the sides are all delicious. I highly suggest the mango ginger flavor for the wings and the turkey chili."
6/20/2017,3 star rating,"So TINYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!  I still can't believe it...  Our wings were soooo small. By far the smallest wings I've ever seen. My wife and I looked at each other in confusion when our wings came out. Crazy. As bad as I want to give this place a bad review, I couldn't. Aside from the extremely tiny wings (at a wing shop) the place is nice and very clean.  The setup is done right. The bathrooms were spotless and the employees were really cool. Long list of wings flavors. They're cooked right, just really small."
10/17/2017,1 star rating,"Not a good experience. For starter's they were out of sweet potato fries. They asked what sauce I wanted with my wings. I chose BBQ sauce...which was a .50 charge for one. Um, so a wing place charges for the first sauce?? How can wings not come with at least one sauce?Then, the green beans were sweet and hella spicy at the same time. Like they had a gallon of Red Hot and a pound of sugar. Gross!!! There was so much Red Hot, the white plastic fork I was eating with turned orange. I had the Flavor 17 wings. Let's just say they needed to take some of the salt of the chicken and put it in the green beans. I mean really, who eats sweet green beans? There were a few pieces that were really cold, as if they weren't fresh and had been reheated. They totally missed the mark for me today but I ate it because I was starving and had to be back at work."
1/28/2015,4 star rating,"So I got an email about this place from Yelp and decided to try them out for lunch. Overall: Not bad. I was a bit concerned when they said a 10 pc was the smallest size they had. But once I got my food, I saw that the wings are very small (no big deal). I had lemon pepper with fries and iced tea. The flavor and texture of the wings were great. Nothing like Bdubb's over done rocks drowning in sauce. The fries got soggy but that's only because I had a carry out. The iced tea was interesting. I think it's green tea, however, it was pretty good also. It was easy to call my order in, the young lady was pleasant, the parking was easy (on the street), and the inside was great. Very clean and streamlined.  I would definitely go there again and refer a friend."
5/12/2020,4 star rating,"Small wings but they pack flavor, and that's what matters right! I live for the lemon pepper 10 piece with fries & extra lemon pepper on my wings. I get the sam thing every time ...I  should really try something else & I will. Clean restrooms, clean environment. The  defiantly  could  fit not seating in the building if they used the space correctly but  it is what it  is. Love them City Wings! Cant wait to get some again!"
4/30/2015,5 star rating,"Great service.  Great food.  Clean, modern interior.Brought a group and we split a party platter and it was perfect - we all got to try a bunch of different flavors.  The mac and cheese was yummy and def homemade.  Even the fries and onion rings were delish."
6/30/2018,5 star rating,"Best wings around. Great staff . Many sauces to explore. We are repeaters. Drove from Washington twp. Just made it to get our wings fix. Hands down the best in and around Detriot   Just yesterday 2/20/17 finally made it back to get a fix well over do.

1/7/2017,3 star rating,"A friend bought me wings from here a few months ago so I decided to stop here while in the area.  I called the order in, and it was ready in about 10 minutes. I had the lunch special which is 10 wings, fries, and a drink for $10.  The garlic parmesan wings were average in taste and small in size. I expected more for $10.  Meh!  May not return.  Update: A fellow Yelper informed me that the lunch special is $7.99 but with tax I paid slightly over $10 for my order. Maybe there's a charge for blue cheese and having a lemonade instead of soda with your order.  I'll have to check in to this."
11/2/2020,3 star rating,This was my first time getting wings from here. I had the BBQ and an order of plain since my Mom wanted to try them. The BBQ was good. The plain were very cooked - crispy almost like bacon and dry. Maybe it was the batch I had but the wings seemed very small compared to other places. The service was good and my phone order was ready when I arrived. I'll give it another try.
8/8/2016,5 star rating,"The best wings I've ever had, AND  the only wings that I will ever have!  This place is the best.  There is nothing else to say!Btw, my favorite are the curry wings!"
5/7/2019,4 star rating,"Affordable, tasty, and friendly service. I had the grilled chicken sandwich dinner which came with two sides. I tried the coleslaw and french fries - both were good. The chicken had a lemon pepper marinade that was really tasty too. There aren't a ton of restaurant options in New Center open on weekday evenings when the worker crowd heads home, so happy to have this place around. Will be back to try the wings!"
8/21/2019,4 star rating,"Delicious fried and sauced wings. No hoopla just good wings and classic drinks like homemade kool-aid, lemonade & ice tea. Wings are a bit on the small side so be prepared for that. Our group of 6 ordered a variety of flavors. Each was tasty, my favorites we're the lemon pepper & honey Bbq ( I'm not a spicy fan but the spicy types enjoyed the hot flavored wings)."
10/2/2019,5 star rating,"The best wings in the City HANDS DOWN! The customer service, flavoring, sides, etc is always amazing to me! The only issue I have is they are closed on Sundays, the perfect day for wings and football!"
8/8/2019,1 star rating,"This place is a joke. Got a wing dinner which is priced at $11.79 and they lied you pay $13.99. It wasn't busy and still had to wait 15mins for food. My sides were fries and onion rings. The onion rings were burnt bad. I live 45mins away and by the time I got home that's when I noticed they were burnt. And the wings were so small, it was like a happy meal for kids. The got barbecue flavored wings and the sauce was watered down. There was hardly any meat on the bones. I'll stick Happy's Wings!! Horrible!!!"
10/12/2015,3 star rating,"This place is a solid ""A-OK"" in my book, especially when it comes to dinner. Here's why:I ordered the dinner special: 10 wings in one sauce with two sides. I went with the hot sauce for the wings, mac and cheese and baked beans for the sides.The price was $13, including a $0.50 side of blue cheese dressing. I'm considering this overpriced for a take out order of 10 wings and two sides.The wings were HOT something fierce. Good mix of drumsticks and wings. Solid.The baked beans were also really good and worth getting. Not super saucy like other baked beans, and the sauce was less reddish-brown than you might be used to. They add ground turkey to the beans, which was a nice touch. I thought this was the best part of the dinner.The mac and cheese wasn't enjoyable. Dried up and not cheesy whatsoever.Overall the meal was fine. The price and the subpar mac and cheese, balanced with some solid wings and some great baked beans, led me to 3 out of 5 stars."
5/30/2019,5 star rating,"I'm here from New Orleans, and was very impressed with the wings here. They are cooked perfectly with lots of flavor. The medium hot wings were delicious... the heat creeped up on me. Over all, wings, onion rings, and fried okra were amazing.  I do recommend!!! Eat here!"
11/29/2016,4 star rating,"I came in here one blustery day and got the lunch special with 10 wingdings. I got the buffalo wings, medium, which came with a dry rub (I think you have to clarify if you want dry rub or wet sauce--newbie mistake on my part!) They were super crispy and pretty darn delicious in spite of my goof-up. I thought 10 might be too much, but they are a smaller size which I think is great so that they don't really dry out too much. Comes with really good fries (dare I say they were my favorite part?) with a crispy exterior and soft fluffy interior. While I was here a DFD truck pulled up and the whole crew got wings to go. Firefighters always have good taste in food...thank you City Wing for feeding our firefighters!I'll be back to try more..."
8/30/2014,5 star rating,"Quite simply one of the three best wings spots in Detroit (captain jays and sweetwater tavern being the others). I have heard so much good things about this place and after having it, it lives up to every positive review.Came here for lunch and first thing is that this place is spotless clean. The one sort of negative thing is that while they do have a lot of flavor options, they don't really let you try various amounts (only 1 for 10, and you have to buy 30 to try 2). The wings are Amish style and already come crispy (which is to my liking). Another thing to remember is the flavors here are dry rubs (with exception to the hot, which was kind of like a sauce/dry rub mix).For my wings, I had the garlic Parmesan (best flavor here, and second best garlic Parmesan I have ever had besides Buffalo Wild Wings sauce of the same), hot (really really good), and the Caribbean jerk (also good). The wings here are small (which I love), so be ready to eat a lot of them. For my sides i went with the okra (pretty good) and the macaroni and cheese (not bad, but nothing special).Overall one of the best wings spots you will ever have in life. They have great deals also and is a great experience. I officially am a fan of this spot and will be back more."
3/2/2019,5 star rating,"Fresh, made-to-order food served up with care by a professional staff. Flavor variety was amazing. My lemon pepper chicken sandwich was not breaded and packed a lot of flavor. Made me feel better about enjoying the fries and sampling my friend's Mac and cheese."
4/7/2017,5 star rating,"This place is super clean! I start there because I love visiting local eateries but when I  first walked in I was in heaven. The food is priced just right. It is delicious. Whenever I go I HAVE TO bring some home for my wife or she'll be very upset.  I've tried at least six of their 19 flavors- most recently recently was the Cajun flavor. It had the right amount of heat to let me know I had to take it easy but luckily I had fries and a cherry lemonade to cool my mouth down.  The Cweet potato pie and Banana pudding are solid though I like more crunch to my BP.Service is A1...  They are all friendly and treat each person like family and close friends. They know the names of their regulars, semi-regulars and even first timers are made to feel welcome. Old school hip hop/ r&b grooves play in the background.  It makes you feel like you're in a neighborhood spot with the EXPECTED cleanliness of a chain."
1/4/2019,4 star rating,The snack attack jerk chicken wings are delicious.  They come with 10 wings.  But the online menu price does not match the actual in store price. They need to fix that. The actual price is higher than what it listed on their online website.
9/27/2017,5 star rating,"Don't come at me with your Buffalo Wild Wings bullshit. These wings were so much sexier, similar to the restaurants aesthetic. Customer service was amazing. The gentleman at the counter could tell we were first timers and was very friendly and gave us great suggestions. Let the record show there is a difference between wings and wing dings. Wing dings are much smaller, something someone from the Pacific NW was hesitant to understand. But seriously come here. Also a plus that they had a ""Support Detroit Kids"" sign in the window."
4/8/2016,3 star rating,"The wings are pretty tasty. I have tried the medium and the garlic-parmesan variety. The blue cheese dressing in a bit ""mayonnaisey"" for my tastes, but serviceable.  The baked beans were very good as well. The green beans were utterly disappointing -- cold and in desperate need of a salt shaker.I will definately give this place another shot."
8/5/2017,4 star rating,The wings are spicy nice good not too hot just right I'll be coming back again next time and try different flavors nice clean dining area to eat customer service was pretty good
5/1/2016,4 star rating,"What can I say...I really like this place.  I like the wings, the sides, as well as the two guys who faithfully run this New Center establishment.  They offer a wider variety of wing flavors, available in dry rubs or wet sauces if your prefer.  The establishment itself is bright and modern...very well done.I usually call my order in ahead of time, and it is always ready right on time.  The sides are tasty, and they have some nice combos if you are buying for two.  My only gripe is that they are not open too late, so they are not around to fulfill a late night crave.For wings in the D, give these guys a try, you won't be disappointed."
12/1/2018,5 star rating,The wings were great. The weren't greasy or soggy. I got hot flavor. It was more like a dry rub than a sloppy wet sauce. It was very good. A good experience all around.
8/26/2017,2 star rating,"This place is over priced for the amount of food you're given. The wings are literally as big as the tip of a fork. There's barely any meat on them. Don't think about getting all flats or drums because you'll be paying 20 cents extra for Each wing (that's highway robbery). The macaroni and cheese is the driest macaroni I've ever tasted. My aunt bought food from here but for the price,size and am out I don't think I'll be spending my money here."
3/9/2015,5 star rating,"Alright, alright, alright!!! It was quite delicious. As other reviewers mentioned, this establishment was modern, fresh, and most importantly clean, including the women's restroom. Friends and I came during lunch hours and each ordered lunch specials. My husband and I ordered medium wings, which were right on point, along with Arnold Palmers. Our friends ordered smoked barbecue and parmesan garlic flavored wings with some sort of berry lemonade. I did notice a couple of other customers with salads. There is a steady flow of traffic, both for carry out and dine in. The lunch rush seemed to come in waves. It was a mixed crowd of blue and white collar workers with others just stopping in for lunch. We found seats easily and our food was brought out in less than 10 minutes (maybe 5) hot and fresh. The french friends were great. Overall, it was a nice atmosphere with music in the background and CNN or ESPN on tv. We will definitely come again. There is street parking, but there also may be parking to the rear as I saw some patrons exit out of the back."
7/27/2018,3 star rating,"City wings is an interesting spot. I had to take one star off for the price. A little pricey compared to other wing places I have been to. Next, I removed a star for the size of the wings. Not sure if they were chicken wings or possibly quail wings, but they were definitely the smallest wings I have ever eaten. Flavor of the wings was good and the fries were actually great. However, I was there for the wings and those were unfortunately too small for my liking."
6/27/2018,1 star rating,Was not happy with the food at all. I had a grilled chicken sandwich that was cold and very very spicy which was not indicated on the menu under the description. Also my co-workers had side salads and they forgot the dressing. When my co-worker called to let them know the men that answered the phone argued with her. Very rude and unprofessional. Never would go back again.
8/2/2016,5 star rating,Very surprising to find this little place.   Had the spicy mango and ginger wing lunch special...deliciousDecided to come back again soon
6/3/2017,1 star rating,I saw city wings on Facebook the food looked good! So I shared with my friends. My husband and I drove from Pontiac to support this black owned business and guess what! At 6:45. On a Saturday they were closed! When their website says they are open until 8pm. So my husband and I went to McDonald's across the street hungry! Thanks city wings!
5/4/2015,3 star rating,"I just tried the wings here for the first time last week, and I must say I did enjoy them.  I would give them 3.75 if I could.I get why some people complain about the size, they are pretty small but they come in a ten piece so that part didnt really bother me.  I had the lemon pepper flavor, seemed like a good pick for wings.  It was, I would like to try some of the other flavors though.  I wish you could mix and match, I mean at least two flavors.Where I messed up with my order though (this was carry out by the way)  was with the sides.  I got the red beans and rice and the green beans.  The green beans were ok, they were not bad or anything but not particularly good.  I think they were probably just the frozen kind cooked with a little meat.  Red beans and rice though, bad.  Absolutely no flavor.  The rice was weird, a little overcooked I think.  Probably the worst red beans and rice I have had in a while.  Just bland.With that being said, its a wing place.  I should have just got fries.  Stick to what they know and you wont be disappointed.  Its a wing place, and they do have good wings."
8/24/2019,5 star rating,Always pleasant and courteous. The wings are good. I get them once a week.  It's a short distance from work.
4/10/2018,3 star rating,"Ah, those are the smallest chicken wings on the planet. Where do they find miniature chickens. The Sweet Potatoe fries were good. The place was very clean and the staff was very friendly, but those wings are soooooo small. I will go there again but I'm getting something other than wings."
5/5/2017,2 star rating,Ugh really wanted to like this place. Got an order of cajun/mild snack sized wings. The fries were good and the flavor was there but my wings were dry as hell. So dry I couldn't even pull them apart. Not even exaggerating :( Also it was pretty expensive $22. Maybe came on a bad day but honestly my wings were so bad I definitely wouldn't come back. The workers were so nice but rather go elsewhere :/
11/8/2014,5 star rating,"Some of the best wings I've had in Michigan! I went to City Wings during lunch time and was pleasantly surprised. The place was nice, clean, and smelled delicious! I ordered the lunch combo which came with 10 wings, fries, and a drink. I got the Hot flavor and they were great! I wish they would let you get more than one flavor with the 10 piece but I know I will go back to try more. The fries were also nice and crispy and cherry lemonade was a perfect companion to the spicy wings. They prepare the wings in a Wok which creates a nice, crisp fry while also serving as a vessel in which they can toss the wings. I was thoroughly impressed with the flavor of the wings as well as the crispness they retained. City Wings is also very well priced and there service is quick. The staff all seemed very nice and they have a TV on if you want to watch ESPN. I would definitely recommend City Wings if you're in Detroit and looking for delicious wings and fries. I look forward to going back and trying different flavors!"
1/25/2017,5 star rating,My favorite wings place. I've eaten here regularly for the past few years and the food is top notch and the service is great. They will keep you coming back. A real hidden gem. Highly recommend
4/7/2018,4 star rating,"Have enjoyed this place several times. Wings are very small but tasty--I told the cook they were like wings I had eaten in Asia, and he said, ""Yes. These are the real wings."" Long list of flavors, but very few drinks, and few side dishes. If you ordered to go, you could drive over to WSU or the riverfront and have them with a beer."
9/16/2016,4 star rating,"This place is a gem. The wings are great, probably the best downtown, they use a dry rub which is different but very tasty.  The sandwich left something to be desired but it is a small, hip interior  that is clean. Price was about average for the area but much cheaper compared to other city's. The wings are much spicier than the average of its heat index. They offer natural green teas which are great. Very easy location right off the highway and near the hospitals and wayne state."
8/22/2016,4 star rating,"Great wings, unique flavors. Very very nice wait staff. The lemonade things are actually really good too! The wings and sauce are custom mixed each time.

2/12/2016,4 star rating,"Ordered 90 wings with five different flavors. Parmesan garlic, Caribbean Jerk, Hot, Cajun, and Spicy BBQ. Parmesan garlic was my favorite. The hot wings were hotter than expected. The wings are small - but the meat is better quality than most wings that I've tried. Employees were nice. We will definitely order here again!"
11/18/2015,5 star rating,These wings are so good! I had to stop myself from going everyday on my lunch! Hickory BBQ are my fave!!! I suggest everyone try their wings! You won't be disappointed!
9/6/2017,5 star rating,"I am amazed at how many people complain about how small or tiny the wings are. Listen folks, the tiny wings are the best. They fry crispy and taste sensational. My first experience with really good wings happened in south Florida at a place called Wings N' Things. The wings were tiny, crispy, and most of all flavor galore. Their blue cheese dip was sensational. Since that time all I get here in Michigan are large fat meaty tasteless wings that are full of skin fat and usually undercooked. City Wings knows exactly what they're doing. If you like the wings then please shut up about how small they are. My only complaint about City Wings is how disorganized the staff can be when the place gets busy. But over time that will improve. They need to set up organized ordering stations and pickup. The WINGS are SO GOOD that it doesn't matter what spice you put on them. Oh, and I would love to see hand made curly fries."

10/5/2011,4 star rating,"On my maiden voyage here I had the cajun wings served up hot. Glad I didn't order them ""K.O."". Especially glad on my mad dash to you-know-where a couple of hours later. Barring that, the wings were very tasty indeed. Charred just a little bit. Perfect. They weren't the biggest wings, but I'll take extra flavorful wings over the usual. I'm not even a wing person but I'll definitely be back to try other flavors.     The service is friendly and the space is big, airy and modern. It's all lofty in there, which wasn't what I expected from passing by it on the Blvd.    They had two TV's with ESPN on. I should've sat by the one showing Pardon the Interruption. I like that program and haven't seen it in awhile."
3/7/2015,4 star rating,"Really good wings. All of their wings are dry seasoned except for two - Teriyaki and Sweet Chili, I think. Those two are sauced. The fries are amazing - crispy but not too thin and well seasoned. We enjoyed the Caribbean Jerk, Teriyaki and Medium wings and really liked all of them. There's a list of sides to choose from - we tried the fries, onion rings and Mac & Cheese. Both the fries and onion rings were very tasty. The restaurant is very well done - brightly lit, clean and the service is great. You step up to the counter to place your order them sit down and they bring it out to you. Not much to choose from in the beverage area - bottled water, fruit punch, iced tea and lemonade."
8/5/2013,5 star rating,"It's been only 2 hours since I had the Caribbean Jerk  & Teriyaki spiced wings with a side order of fries and sweet tea, and I'm already craving another visit to City Wings!Everything about our dining experience was excellent! Plenty of street parking in front of the place. Friendly customer service. Delectably delicious food & drinks. Beautiful modern space. Immaculately clean interior. What's not to love?We opted for the Lunch Special of a 10-piece wing basket, side order of fries, and a drink for $8.49 (not bad). Not only was it a good deal, but it was some seriously ""finger-lickin' good"" food!!! Their focus on quality ingredients really shines thru in their house-made spice rubs, use of Amish chickens, hand-cut fries, great sides, and made-from-scratch Cherry Lemonade & Ice Tea really made for a 5-star meal. Shame on me for waiting nearly two whole years to FINALLY dine here, and shame on YOU if you have yet to dine here. So what are you waiting for? On your next visit to Midtown, go for a detour down West Grand Blvd (just past the Fischer Building) and stop in at City Wings for some fantastic food...I wouldn't steer you wrong!"
8/23/2018,5 star rating,"Very chill and cool place for a 100% authentic Detroit wings, When you first see this place from outside you might not think that much about it, they got a more modern vibe in there with a huge wood bench build right next to the wall. They literally got about 10 different wings on there to satisfy each individual's unique tongue, on top of that you know you are in the right place for wings if the majority of their menu is wings and sides that go with wings. I got K.O and my boyfriend got Garlic & parmesan traditional wings while we were there, and Phew, dudes, and gals ""Don't do the K.O flavor unless you are a daredevil that has the tongue that can drink pepper juice that's spicier than the ghost pepper juice."" I thought I was a tough shit with spice wings until I tried the K.O flavor, and let me tell you, it was so GOOD and so spicy that I can only finish 4 out of 15 wings. I definitely will come back to here, the quality of their wing is no doubt a 10/10, I'll just make sure I order a less spicy one next time, Lol."
2/23/2017,4 star rating,"City wings offer you a bunch of different flavored wings my favorite was the garlic parmesan , the lemon pepper were just okay basic fries but the cherry lemonade was delicious would return looks clean parking could be tricky.."
2/12/2016,4 star rating,"Ordered 90 wings with five different flavors. Parmesan garlic, Caribbean Jerk, Hot, Cajun, and Spicy BBQ. Parmesan garlic was my favorite. The hot wings were hotter than expected. The wings are small - but the meat is better quality than most wings that I've tried. Employees were nice. We will definitely order here again!"
2/17/2014,4 star rating,"My husband loves his wings.I stopped here because I was in the neighborhood, and I'd heard the wings were great.  It was during the snow/chill of 2014, so the place was pretty empty for noon on a weekday.  I ordered plenty so I would have leftovers for my husband, the true wing fan.I ordered a lunch special and a wing dinner - Caribbean Jerk and Parmesan Garlic.  Dinner came with two sides.  I selected BBQ Baked Beans and ""I Don't Eat Everybody's"" Potato Salad at the suggestion of the person taking my order, who might have been an owner (seemed like she had a personal stake in my dining experience).While I was waiting a ""regular"" who said he has had every flavor told me the Flavor 17 was the way to go.Everything was very good, although everything was too salty for my taste.Service, prices, cleanliness, variety were all excellent.  I personally wouldn't go out of my way for these again, but I do recommend that if you like wings you give City Wings a shot."
10/10/2013,4 star rating,"I went to city wings with a friend of mine to grab dinner. We were actually pleasantly surprised how clean and neat the place was from the inside. It was a welcoming and quiet atmosphere as well. Finding parking was not too bad either. As for the wings, they're probably not the best I ever had but they were still really really good. There was a ton of sauces to select from as well. We picked the Parmesan garlic and the Cajun flavors and they were both pretty good. The Cajun had a nice kick to it as well. If you're used to BWWs then the sauce flavors at City Wings feel more like BWW rubs. As a result, some people might consider them a bit dry but they were perfectly ok for me. I'm definitely going back to try more sauces. A few of things I wish were different:- I eat a lot of wings generally so I wish we were allowed to pick more than 2 flavors for 30 wings. I'm used to pick a flavor per 6 at BWWs.- The blue cheese dip was not the best. It looked old and a bit dark. The flavor was really artificial like the type you would buy from a store with all the preservatives. I don't think its that hard to find good quality blue cheese sauce. - The celery sticks didn't look that fresh. They were served to us in a ziplock bag with a few pieces."
11/30/2016,5 star rating,This place has great wings and even better staff/owners. If you're in Detroit and craving wings I would highly suggest City Wings!
8/22/2016,4 star rating,"Great wings, unique flavors. Very very nice wait staff. The lemonade things are actually really good too! The wings and sauce are custom mixed each time. I like the fried okra. The lunch specials are also really generous. I recommend this place for wings over buffalo wild wings all day. But no beers."
7/29/2013,5 star rating,Some of the best wings in the Detroit area. The flavors are amazing and the wings are done crispy as they should be. The sides are to die for.......had the baked beans and mac n cheese. Homemade cherry lemonade is pretty good too. The employees were very nice and helpful when making recommendations. Very clean.
7/9/2016,5 star rating,"We stumbled upon this Gem in the city!!  Great wings, great dining, great staff!!  Flavor on the wings was outstanding.   You must try it!!"
10/6/2016,5 star rating,"I very rarely write reviews. With that being said, I couldn't resist telling you how great this place is. I saw everyones suggestions on getting the lunch special so that's exactly what I did. I got the honey habanero wings. Unbelievable. The fries were perfect. Fresh and crisp. Such a great meal for just $10."
6/1/2018,2 star rating,"The chicken is dry. The sauces aren't well developed and have a weird aftertaste. The service is friendly, but slow."
11/19/2012,5 star rating,"This place is awesome!Went in there around 6pm, place was empty - Got the ""Date Night"" special (30 wings, 2 orders of fries and 2 drinks) plus a side of mac + cheese. Total cost was around $25, more food than we could eat. They have a ton of great flavors, and the wings are prepared fresh to order. The ""hot"" wings didn't actually have a sauce, but more of a dry rub which was really delicious, and they were nice and crispy. We also tried the parmesan & garlic which were the best I have ever had.Sides were good - fries were hot and crisp, mac and cheese was quite tasty as well. I would stop back anytime I was in the area."
11/5/2012,4 star rating,"Other than the fact that I waited maybe 15 minutes for my order (which is actually totally understandable, since there were people ahead of me and they were making it fresh), I absolutely loved the food. Totally worth trying, but make sure to call ahead or just have the time to wait for your food."
9/27/2017,1 star rating,"The quality has really gone down from the time they opened or maybe they just had a bad day. I went there a few days ago and ordered ten plain wings, fries, and a lemonade. The wings were horribly dry and dark, drastically different than when I was there a year ago. The fries and lemonade were ok. Of course they told me to bring the wings back but my break was over. That was almost 13.00 wasted and I won't be going back anytime soon."
9/17/2012,3 star rating,"well, I am currently eating the wings. I ordered the medium heat, and it's not too hot, not mild. The wings are very tasty, but I'm giving them 3 stars because the service leaves something to be desired. They are understaffed (or at least they were today). I ordered on the phone and came to pick up which is a good thing because people had been waiting a very long time. my dipping sauce was missing from the bag, but I didn't notice until I got back to my office. I would try them again. DEFINITELY CALL AHEAD! If I go back and have a different experience I might increase my star count."
9/27/2011,4 star rating,"I say yay, too! I love City Wings and I'm not even a wing person. I like the wings I've had in Koreatown Los Angeles. I like the sriracha wings at Cass Cafe. And I love City Wings!I get the ten piece, it's plenty because the wings are a good size. The spicy bbq is my fave. Tasty chicken and enough bbq sauce to make a total mess of your fingers. Don't plan on texting during your meal. I've also tried the sweet chili (like a thai style glaze), medium (a basic dry rub), and cajun (a spicy dry rub). Personally, I like the sauces over the dry rubs. The ranch is kind of bland so stick to the blue cheese dip.The mac and cheese, potato salad and green salad are recommended but be aware the potato salad contains egg. The vibe is clean and minimal, service is polite and with a smile. Amish chicken and green products set it apart from chain wing joints.Celery is by request and you only get a few pieces. I like a lot so I bug my friends to request theirs so I can eat the extra. There aren't quite enough vegetarian options. Greens without meat would be a good addition. They should learn how to make the veggie ""wings"" I had in Grand Rapids at the Stella Cafe. They were actually deep fried potato wedges, super crispy, with amazing sauce. But that's another story.Skip the expensive, crowded bbq spots in Detroit. City Wings is a great place to meet friends for a fun meal and a great excuse to visit New Center."
4/7/2017,5 star rating,First time ever. Won't be the last. The lemon pepper chicken is the bomb. If I could give them ten stars I would. Best wings ever. Hope City Wings decide to expand into the downriver area.
3/29/2011,4 star rating,"I hate to call this place a fast food restaurant. The food is too good, the decor is too nice, and the customer service is over the top.The wings are fresh Amish chicken, brought to the fryer as soon as they're ready to be cooked and then finished off in a wok with a choice of 14 sauces and seasonings. The barbecue sauces are great, but my favorites are the lemon-pepper and curry. Of course, they have ranch and blue cheese dressing for dipping, but trust me, you won't need them.Sides are fresh and homemade and I was really impressed with the green beans (organic!) and macaroni and cheese that's made with Cheddar, Mexican, Parmesan and American cheeses.The interior is sleek, modern and CLEAN (I don't think even all caps emphasizes that enough. Plus, they have two TVs so you can catch up with anything that's on ESPN.You won't find a menu board at the counter at City Wings and that's intentional (although you can pick up a menu card at the counter). Owner Grant Lancaster and his cousins are committed to customer interaction and service and they are always too kind. They're great people and treat all of their customers as if they were friends and family at their own houses.Plus, I have to give Grant extra props for using bio-degradable packaging, cups, straws and eating utensils.We need more places like this in Detroit and the Detroit area. City Wings sets a great example."
11/5/2012,3 star rating,"Had been wanting to try this spot for a minute after hearing and reading the rave reviews.  Decided to go for lunch today and was disappointed. Ordered the wing dinner with two sides, Mac n' cheese and red beans n' rice.   The jerk wings didn't taste like jerk at all and were slightly over cooked.  They were more like slightly spicy salty wings. The Mac n' cheese was average, needed more cheese.   The red beans n' rice was more like bean soup.  Good thing I like bean soup cause it was the best of the three items I ordered.  Wish they would have given me a spoon for the soup. I think I'll try this place again and perhaps a different wing flavor. Perhaps this was a one time screw up over cooking the wings."
9/8/2012,5 star rating,"These wings are to die for!  We got 10 hot and 10 jerk wings , fries, macaroni, sweet potato pie and bread pudding for $27....a steal..And the wings are cooked right in front of you, crispy and tasty, no more B-dubs for this girl..there was not one item we had that was not unbelievable..it was all perfect.I would recommend getting take out since they don't sell liquor, but the quality and taste makes this place a must try.  The restaurant is very nice and clean.  Great customer service, but the truth is, it is all about the wings! I will be coming back, many many times....sad I haven't tried it sooner!Word from the wise:  They have a plethora of free parking behind the restaurant, don't pay in the front!"
6/26/2012,5 star rating,"Amazing wings!  All-around great business. Excellent service. Very clean. You can tell the owner put his heart and soul into this place because thoughtfulness is evident in every last detail. I got the lemon pepper wings-which were delish-with organic green beans and a side salad. (Watchin' the carbs!) The ingredients were high quality and some were even organic! Have I died and gone to wing heaven?I should go on more about the food which was truly fantastic, but wouldn't do this place justice if I didn't tell you about why you should feel really good about supporting this local business. The atmosphere is modern and super clean.  A pleasant surprise for a wing place. The kitchen is open for the most part so you can see how they prepare the food and know that they really do take the quality and food prep seriously. What really surprised me was that they use all compostable products from a local company. Not only are they serving great food, they are also supporting another local business and taking care of the environment!"
4/12/2011,5 star rating,A great place to get some great wings.  This place is clean and modern.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.  Loved the different flavors.Great addition to the MidTown area.  The sweet tea was excellent also.  Will go back again.  I can't imagine it being better than the first time though.

7/29/2014,4 star rating,Delicious wings with dry run flavoring. They are crispy and delicious. Only downfall is that you can't get more flavors when you order a ten piece it can only be in flavor. Still great enough for a second visit!

3/29/2011,5 star rating,"I was blown away when I walked into City Wings - the space is really clean and modern, simple but well-designed.  In a city where restaurant design is usually an afterthought, this was a huge and pleasant surprise.I had the salad with chicken breast and it was excellent, they use red leaf lettuce and the tomato was actually flavorful.  I avoided the iced tea because it is pre-sweetened but the lemonade was good (wouldn't mind if they added a beverage that wasn't loaded with sugar).  My friend had the wings with garlic and parmesan and loved them.Everyone is really friendly and they use GreenSafe products - an extra bonus.  I highly recommend this place and I will DEFINITELY be back."
8/24/2011,4 star rating,"This is a good spot for lunch when you find yourself in New Center.  The food is solid, not impressive.  The wings are cooked to order but not seasoned, so they lacked a little depth of flavor.  K.H.'s review was spot on, get the lunch special and this place feels like a whole different world when you're inside.     Things that impressed me:-Wings cooked to order-Delivery-Cleanliness-Price-They use Michigan Green Safe productsThings that did not:-Sweet tea.  I DESPISE SWEET TEA.  Warn me before serving it to me.    While this is a good place for wings, it's no match for Sweetwater.  Then again, few places are.  But if you don't want to deal with the hassle of going downtown, this is a great alternative."
9/16/2016,4 star rating,"This place is a gem. The wings are great, probably the best downtown, they use a dry rub which is different but very tasty.  The sandwich left something to be desired but it is a small, hip interior  that is clean. Price was about average for the area but much cheaper compared to other city's. The wings are much spicier than the average of its heat index. They offer natural green teas which are great. Very easy location right off the highway and near the hospitals and wayne state."
8/5/2014,4 star rating,"It was nice inside, the cashier was knowledgable and helpful and very friendly. Great wings and service."
1/26/2014,4 star rating,This place won me over. The price. The people. The music. They literally can do no wrong. Garlic Parmesan wings all day.  Fries are crispy and light. Cherry lemonade is perfectly sweetened.
9/21/2012,5 star rating,"Most people grow up on wings from fast food and chain restaurants.  I've had them all: Buffalo Wild Wings, Wingstop, Quaker Steak & Lube, Hooters, etc...  They are all the same basic ""good"" wing.City Wings is 10 - 20 notches above all these joints.You can tell the folks at City Wings really care about quality.  The restaurant decor itself is simple and clean, putting the emphasis on the food.  And there's a simple four-point checklist you can use to judge any wing.  Here is how City Wings stack up:1) Crispy skin? - CHECK (It's perfect)2) Tender meat? - CHECK (It's marvelous)3) Tasty sauce? - CHECK (Try any of them... they're all delicious.  Even the ""KO"")4) Correct amount of sauce? - CHECK (The wings weren't drowning in the sauce, rendering the skin soggy)The folks at City Wings are wing artisans.  I don't know if it's possible for wing making to be ""artisanal"", but if it could be, here are the masters."
2/21/2013,5 star rating,I have been wanting to try this wings joint for a few months now and finally got around to it for lunch today. I had a 10 pc wings with parmesan garlic flavor and fries. The wait time was pretty typical (about 10 minutes). The car ride home was practically unbearable with the amazing smell coming from my takeout bag. They tasted even better. I will definitely be going back to try the other flavors too!
1/7/2013,5 star rating,"If I murdered someone and got caught and was allowed one last meal before the state put me to death for my crimes, I would request the Lemon Pepper wings as my last meal.The skin is crispy, and the meat is tender. I'm practically ready to pop someone right now just so I can go to prison and make sure my last meal is City Wings. Seriously. I'm freaking out. Someone call my husband.Oh, and the green beans are my jam."
8/6/2012,3 star rating,"I love the decor of this place. Plus, they cook the wings when and only when you order them, so it is a bit of a wait but the freshness is worth it. They still don't have any stools at the window counter so you can't get that NYC street pizzeria feel yet but I'm hoping those will be available soon. The wings are a tad small but that's just me wishing there were more flavor to savor. This is a great business for the New Center area of Detroit, and with the loft style construction might even work as a gallery of sorts. Throw an art show here somebody! Huzzah!"
7/19/2011,5 star rating,"Let me just start by saying I am addicted to wings!!! My mom turned me on this place today! We had the garlic Parmesan wings and they were simply delicious! Lol The fries had a nice crispiness and the price is not bad at all, considering what I've paid for wings before! The wings were a nice size as well! They weren't chicken wings on steroids but they definitely weren't pigeon wings either! I will definitely be back tomorrow! :-)"

2/1/2015,2 star rating,"Wings were over-cooked and dry - disappointing based on other yelp reviews. Order was take-out, a few hours before the Super Bowl. Maybe it was just a bad day for City Wings."
2/19/2012,5 star rating,"Wings were amazing. Not a sloppy wet sauce, but almost like a rub. Perfectly seasoned. Nice sized wings. Juicy.

3/17/2012,5 star rating,"We were at Henry Ford Hospital and after a few days we were done with all of the on campus food choices. We found City Wings online and took a short walk. Its a great place. The staff go over the choices and make suggestions. The specials are reasonable and the food is really good. Its all fresh ingredients. The have a range of sauces to match every adventure level. Also, they do have free wifi. And finally they are a green restaurant. The cups are recycled and recyclable. Recycled paper and cardboard serving pieces. I give an extra star for any business that goes this extra mile. As Detroit ""comes back"", this is a model to follow"
