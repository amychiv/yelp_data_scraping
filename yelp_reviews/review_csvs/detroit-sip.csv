10/17/2021,5 star rating,"After a hiatus of more than a year, this Black and female-owned coffee shop reopened October 14, 2021! I don't know the nitty gritty, but I'm sure being out of commission for so long during the pandemic likely set the business back a little. Let's keep this anchor institution on this newly-renovated strip of McNichols alive and well by showing them some love.If you've never been before, the owner is super friendly and welcoming. The place is unabashedly Detroit-centric with names like the ""Livernois Latte"" and ""Coleman Cappuccino"" and a Detroit mural located on the ceiling over the counter area. In addition to all the usual espresso drinks and three roasts of filter coffee, Detroit Sip offers drip decaf coffee, iced decaf coffee and decaf espresso drinks (which is good for poor shmucks like me who can no longer drink regular coffee). There's also hot chocolate, cider, chai and teas. They even sell pop (Faygo and Vernor's, of course) and some juices like a local bottled ginger drink. If you're hungry, there are a few savory items like chili as well as sweets like big slices of cake and donuts.Detroit Sip offers free WiFi and lots of seating choices with plenty of tables and chairs and a couple comfy armchairs by the window, making it a great place to study. Oh, and they offer a rewards card. Buy five coffees and your sixth one's free! A great excuse to keep coming back and supporting this business (as if you needed one),"

I went by on Small Business Saturday and they were hosting a showcase of so many local small businesses and artists inside, it truly was a celebration of what makes Detroit amazing.Support a business that understands the value of hot coffee and community."
6/12/2020,5 star rating,"Detroit Sip on McNichols exclusively serves products from Detroit companies, so that means beans from Germack and Ashe Supply Co., and pastries and savory dishes by Dutch Girl Donuts (y'all KNOW that Dutch Girl is my J-A-M!), Better Made Chips (another personal fave of mine), A-Team Cheesecakes, Brooklyn Brownies, Soups by Jane, Pinky's Shuga Shack, and lots more. The staff are wonderful: friendly and attentive. As soon as I walked in the door, I felt welcome. The vibe is really good and I liked the interior decorating as well. Great spot for a pick-me up; trust me, you wouldn't like me when I am hangry!Oh and did I mention Detroit Sip is local and black-owned? Just two more great reasons to stop in and TREAT YOURSELF!"

Most importantly the owner is so warm and really takes care of each of her customers. Also a great, relaxed place to do work."
6/27/2019,5 star rating,"Every time I'm visit him (Detroit) I make sure I stop in for a cup of coffee. I always leave with much more though. I have amazing conversations, good coffee and I usually learn something new, which is always a plus. Please visit and enjoy this gem"

12/10/2018,4 star rating,"A blessing to have a coffee shop this close to University of Detroit Mercy, and very close to my office on 6mile/McNichols. Great community space for meeting friends, community groups, etc.  Hours are particular - Thursday through Sunday at the moment. Next door to the future Homebase, a community focused information center by Live 6 non-profit.Lots of street parking and the coffee is pretty good too!"
8/30/2018,5 star rating,Tried it for the first time to work on the computer.  Coffee was good and the interior was comfortable and perfect.  There's plenty of seating and outlets.  Cinnamon rolls looked good too.  I'll definitely be coming back
8/20/2018,5 star rating,"I had seen an article about the place and decide to check out since it was only 11 mins from home.  I was looking for a place that my knitting group might try and the Detroit Sip would be great. The atmosphere was very charming and positive ( the great saying on the tables). The owner is very community driven which is great for our area. Plus you are greeted as soon as you come in ( most places don't recognize you). The food was tasty and the coffee and lemonade was too. My daughter and I found this place to be perfect for our knitting ( the owner said she would like to learn- that would be a job for my Mom. She loves to teach people to knit and crochet) group or just chill. The prices seem fine to me, but I don't speak out of others pockets so check it out for yourself.  But this place is worth checking out"

After this I'll branch out, maybe try the Carmel Macchiato next. They have a nice assortment of baked things and snacks to go with the coffee. They have tea, too.  But coffee's my thing!  The room is big and light and airy, with different interesting areas to sit in.  I struck up a conversation with another customer. The whole visit was delightful."
