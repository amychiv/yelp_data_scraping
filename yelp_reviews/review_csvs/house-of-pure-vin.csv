They have a dj, small plates, wine specials and good people. The owner is there meeting and greeting, the staff was amazing and very helpful. From the outside you would think it was small on the inside but it's actually a nice size. They have a nice assortment of wines and a wine club and other events you have to check their website.Parking is available near by but if you are familar woth downtown Detroit you know how it is. I highly reccomend this business!!!"

5/31/2022,5 star rating,"I stumbled upon this place while walking around downtown Detroit with my girlfriends. The ladies were very friendly and personable and seems pretty knowledgeable so I decided to check it out. Beautiful wine bar with decent amount of wine options. We each purchased $25 wine tasting credit and were brought to the back room to the bar area. I love the concept. The wines were separated by color (whites vs reds) and taste (dry vs sweet). You have an option of a taste, a half glass, of a full glass and the prices were very reasonable. By the time I finished I was nice and tipsy and happy. Also bought a bottle to go!"
4/3/2022,5 star rating,"Great place to find the perfect bottle or just a great bottle of wine!  Based on my criteria , the staff and owner are able to come up with a couple recommendations that have all proved to fit the bill with some exceptional selections that have proven to be memorable.  Thank you house of pure vin.  The location is excellent  and easy to pop into or order online.  You don't need a huge pocketbook to enjoy a nice curated , drinkable bottle of delicious wine."

Even better, Wine and Pilates on Zoom....""Just don't put ice or water in the Wine!""Signed up for 'House of Pure Vin' with Fitness Guru, Lisa Mils. SOME deliberate Stretch and Moans. Another way of saying, Fancy Body-Talk and enjoy Wine! It was about 45mins! Targeting all the right areas; hips and rump! And some of that muscle and body toning for my legs to abs. Working every core in the muscle group(s). At least that's how I felt. Promise! From stretch bands to circular movements. Even 1 of my favourites: Plie SQuats! Lift Heels together, hmph. She was very professional and was on it...calling us out, on the Cast! Much encouragement. Had a great time stretching. Definitely looking forward to another!Some Fancy pairings for yah.....Regina, HoPV host great venues from Sunday brunch to room gatherings for your tasting pleasures. Love the glass-room, much to sip and sample. Must try the 'Cognac Wine!' AND lastly, Instagram Live - Chef talks and Wine Maker's Series!  Intrigued??  She is, 'Looking forward to Seeing you!'"
10/18/2020,5 star rating,This terrific establishment absolutely made my two week work stay in Detroit. Every recommendation from Andrea (I think?) was superb.
5/8/2017,5 star rating,"This is a great Detroit based company owned by women. Absolutely love the look of the store and the wide selection of wines. They offer free wine tastings and validated parking. For $5 they have cute little totes that hold 4 bottles of wine, something thats incredibly easy to fill up here. The owner is great, she really knows her stuff. I highly recommend checking this place out and picking up gifts or a bottle for dinner!"
3/9/2019,5 star rating,"Visited House of Pure Vin last weekend to grab a bottle of champagne; though I don't live in Detroit, if I were to visit the city again, I would definitely come back. As soon as we walked in, someone greeted us and individually showed us what we were looking for and helped us decide what to get. This was especially helpful because we were not very knowledgeable about champagne.  They carried a wide selection of products and everything was clearly displayed and esthetically pleasing. One of my pet peeves is products that are dusty or in boxes. I really appreciated the open space here, it's an ideal layout for hosting wine-tasting. I think the personal touch really sets this place apart from your regular wine seller. We did not feel rushed and so therefore were able to make a great selection for our event. If you are looking for a great place to thoughtfully purchase a bottle of wine, I'd strongly recommend visiting House of Pure Vin."
7/7/2016,5 star rating,"Amazing wine shop downtown on Woodward Ave! I accidentally stumbled upon this fabulous spot while walking to my car after dinner with friends. The walls are lined with endless bottles arranged by country, from local to international selections personally chosen by a renowned Master Sommelier! This spot has so much to offer-- from serving as a great gathering place for groups; to gifts of wine or accessories; to an all glass chilled room chick full of sparkling champagnes; to tastings and other social events. The staff is super friendly and invited us in, gave us a tour, offered us a free tasting, directed us to their website and signed us up for the rewards program. This is definitely Detroit's hottest new wine spot that every local wine lover should check out.,"
9/4/2019,5 star rating,I had my first experience last Sunday at their Detroit location while enjoying a full brunch with sample wine tasting. The food was simple yet amazing accompanied by a 3-piece jazz band. Evidently they conduct the brunch/wine/jazz event on a monthly basis. I strongly recommend taking a trip down to their place.
10/19/2019,5 star rating,Great experience. Native Detroit owner...support this business. Many wine experience options. Sign up for the monthly wine club. Life and wine just go together :-).
6/15/2017,2 star rating,"Came in with a colleague and were treated very poorly. We came in wearing our sweats so I'm wondering if this was the reason. Shouldn't matter. The woman at the front, a young African-American girl, was not helpful at all. We were looking for champagne and she told us to go to the back room to search for wine and never came in to check in on us, even though we were the only customers in there. We browsed their selection but chose not to get anything. As we were walking out, a woman with her business casual outfit and sleek shades came in and she was treated like gold. Didn't even acknowledge us as we were leaving. I felt like Julia Roberts in pretty woman -- I was close to going to a different wine shop, coming back to show her all my wine purchases and saying ""big mistake...huge!"".Gorgeous shop with an incredible selection, but tell your sales associate to treat everyone with exceptional service."
11/17/2016,5 star rating,"Looking for a special wine from a special region? Or perhaps you want to grab a bottle of champagne for a special event. House of pure vin not only curates a great selection of both, but the employees are well versed in everything, knowledgeable, and give great recommendations. Came here out of pure curiosity while in the area. For starters, the space in and of itself is beautiful. A statement wall from ceiling to floor covered in hollow round vessels filled with wine. Separated by regions and type, you'll be mesmerized just walking through. Towards the back of the space is an enclosed 'cellar' of champagne. I'm no champagne connoisseur, but after a walk through and recommendations from an employee, I somewhat feel like I am. We ended up walking away with a bottle of Lallier which we later on that night popped open after my now fiance 'popped' the question :-) In the back of the space is a tasting room where we tried a few wines. Such a fun yet intimate space that allows you to throw parties in it if you are part of their wine club. A great experience overall!"
10/14/2017,5 star rating,"SO cool that Detroit has wine stores now!!  This place was great.  We went in the tasting room and got to try a few different wines for free!  The wine in the store is sorted by origin, and they have a really good selection, even of Michigan wines (which can ironically be hard to find a large selection of).  I ended up buying a bottle, and it was fantastic!  Big win all around :)"
1/6/2016,5 star rating,"A wine store like no other!First I'll start with the space.  It is a classy meets contemporary meets industrial shop.  I love what they have done with the space. The wines are organized by region and in the back they have a cool refrigerated-like room for champagne selection.  They also have a tasting room in back for wine tastings they will host with a Sommelier, who is 1 of 3 in the state of Michigan. These tastings are free and happen weekly! I've gone to a few and they are full of information and facts about the wine. Also you will notice tables lined up with a selection of wine bottles. This table features all the wine that is on special. Everything on the table is below $20.  Next customer service. They are personable, helpful and very knowledgeable.  They can look anything up and answer just about any question. They take the time to help you pick out the perfect bottle or two or ten.  You really do receive personable one-on-one experience.Finally the selection. If you are looking to venture outside of your Yellowtail or Barefoot I would highly recommend coming here. I also would recommend it to ta wine connoisseur. The selection is like no other. Only other selection I've seen like this place would be Merchant's in Dearborn. They have bottles ranging in all prices. Don't worry about parking, there is street parking available on Woodward or down the streets off Woodward or you can park in the Z parking Garage and Pure Vin will validate 1 hour of parking :)"
9/16/2018,5 star rating,Everytime I come to Detroit I always come to this Winery it's by far the best winery that I've gone to and I do like to go to different wine tasting places. The staff is very friendly and they know a lot about the wines and the people that come in. I gave a vague description of what I wanted and they hit it on the nail not only that but they were able to order the wine that I got last time and it's only going to take a couple of days to get here very excited that I got a chance to come here again and I highly recommend not only buy one from this place but also get on their emailing list they do have a lot of different wine tasting and events.
12/16/2018,5 star rating,"The best wine experience I've ever had! I know nothing about wine. The staff were so helpful, they educated me on the best wine to pair with my meal."
12/29/2016,5 star rating,"I love this place! So, I live in Houston, TX and was in the Detroit area for the Holidays. I saw a news segment on the House of Vin and told my friends we should check it out. When we went, we were so impressed by how organized and easy it was to navigate! The sales lady was sooooo helpful!!! And I love how they have such a variety of prices! I will definitely visit this place every time I return home :-)"
9/17/2018,4 star rating,"How can I express how much I LOVE THIS PLACE! The staff is so knowledgeable and friendly.  My only gripe is I don't think my favorite Cognac is ever coming back. If you are in the downtown Detroit area,  this is a must stop location."
2/28/2016,5 star rating,Beautiful space. Friendly and helpful staff. Wine tasting was a great experience. Great selection of wines.
9/11/2016,5 star rating,I love this place. I am a young wine drinker but when I go here Regina always takes care of me and she always helps me to find a great bottle of something. In addition the store frequently offers wine tasting that help to educate you on different process of making wine and how to pair your wine perfectly.

6/13/2016,5 star rating,My fiance and I were looking for quality champagne for our upcoming wedding and found a great selection here in their champagne room. The co-owner was so kind and gave us a few recommendations that I think will fit the occasion perfectly. The shop is gorgeous and offers a selection that we were unable to find in the places we looked in beforehand. Highly recommend!
6/2/2016,5 star rating,"This is a new, beautiful, and intimate venue.  The store owners are very professional and helpful. The wine tastings are free and very frequent, so you are bound to find one that fits your schedule."
5/3/2016,5 star rating,Amazing wine shop with a very knowledgeable master sommelier who picks the wine. They also have multiple wine tastings during the month. Which is nice so that you can taste wine amd discover what you like. Prices are very affordable.
4/12/2016,5 star rating,I visited this establishment and had a very good experience. I am a wine lover and I was not disappointed. One of the owners even tapped into a wine palate I didn't know I had!! Lol... She introduced me to a very good Rosè. I had a great time tasting a learning new things about wines and she was very knowledgeable!! I walked away with a nice variety of wine and even a very affordable bottle of champagne. It's a must go to spot!!

2/7/2016,5 star rating,"Teri, Regina and Gina have such a beautiful space that is devoted to serving the curious, cultured and novice wine drinker. My bf and I were stuck in the D during the snow storm and Teri suggested the Susana Balbo Malbec after I mentioned how much I love Malbec.Let's just say that tasting this line feels akin to literally stepping into the plushest Guccislippers- ever. These women know exactly what they are doing and I will certainly be back to visit....hopefully for their free tasting next time. With Love from Harlem, Jantell"
