5 star rating,"Easily some of the BEST food I've had in my entire! Considering I've tried so many different cuisines, I was so grateful to try something that surprised and delighted me!After initially ordering via UberEats and realizing almost two hours later the order never reached the restaurant, my friend and I called the restaurant to place a carry out order an hour before closing. The server was kind and guided us in suggesting some of their specialties/popular items. We ordered the suya chicken with joloff rice and plaintains, lemon pepper jerk chicken with ginger curry chickpeas and jerk oxtail with truffle oil greens and turmeric rice. Everything was fresh and had such equal balances of spicy, savory and sweet. The oxtail was perfectly seasoned and cooked, tender and falling right off the bone. It was my first time trying holiday rice and suya chicken, and they both had the spicy heat I love, and the chicken's peanut and lightly sweet flavors were amazing and truly special. The coconut rice and chickpeas were a perfect balance to the spicy lemon pepper jerk, which was a perfect zing and mellow heat. I usually would devour a good meal like this easily, but I found myself wanting to savor it and save some for leftovers! This experience was well worth the two hour wait, and I'm already waiting to go back! Grateful to have such awesome food right in the heart of my city! The world needs to know about Yumvillage! And more locations! What a gem?!"
5 star rating,"The food is Great!!!, but the service is lacking.Ordered online the day before for curbside pickupOnline instructions say knock on the Red side door,while acquiescing patrons inside looked terrifiedby my actions. I stepped inside and explained tomanagement my reason for knocking and they saidno such info. exists, so don't follow in my footsteps.My food was ready, sitting on a rack labeled 'PickupCurbside', before hastily leaving I should've checkedmy bags. In retrospect Leo Getz words about thedrive thru are resonating in my head. Yum Villageforget to give me my Ginger Curry Chickpea Salad& My 2 pints of Cajun Fire Beer Honey Ale. I should'vesuspected something delusive when they declined to look at my license after I offered to show it to them.I tried calling them but every voicemail selection isjust the same recording, no real persons available.I'm to blame for the order failure as much as they are, not getting my one shot at their Cajun Fire Beermade me feel like I left 'The Nuclear Football' behind.Not sure if I'll ever return, the food was Yum Yum,but the service was not so yummy."
3 star rating,The food is delicious. So if you haven't been there you need to get there.We support Black Owned Businesses. Keep up the good food and hospitality!
5 star rating,"Was in the area and decided I wanted to try some traditional African food so I called in some Yum Village. I heard great things about it and have it a go. I ordered on the phone and was greeted by a warm welcome. I said good afternoon how are you and was replied by ""All is well"". I reflected on this statement and I affirmed yes indeed it was because they followed up with some good reccomendations and was delighted by some traditional African fare. I ordered some Oxtail and jollof rice. The oxtail was fall off the bone tender, cooked in some root vegitables and peppers. The jollof rice I loved because it was spiced perfectly. Level of heat is not lowered to western standards. Its tradional spicy. I shared this dish with my family and they all loved it. So in the end all is well."
5 star rating,I was ready for a meal here until 15 mins before I was going to pick up my order I received a msg saying my order was cancelled. They will not have a good review from me until I have a real experience here and able to gauge their level of customer service. NOT pleased at all with the cancellation.
1 star rating,"You know it's going to be good when you smell your dinner before you open the door. Yum Village is a wonderful balance of spicy and savory. The potions are generous, the rice was a perfect spice level. We ordered the curry spiced chicken (cool village combo) loved the spice level, mild medium. The jerk smoked chicken quarter (classic village combo) was fall off the bone tender, and had some heat (medium to medium hot). The Elder village combo however was unexpectedly our favorite, ordered a small as a side dish but we filled up on it. The maafe rice and corn cakes are amazing. Everything was good. However, the best touch is the pickled/fermented green peppers. They could sell those pickled peppers in a jar and put McClure's out of business."
5 star rating,I got fufu and Egusi with jollof rice and in about 30 minutes after I was on the toilet regretting life's choices. Seriously the worst food I've eaten. The fufu was more of a mash potato texture was very under cooked the egusi was watery and tasted way to strong of herring the jollof tasted like it was cooking in cigarette ashes for the last 28hrs. I thought the last time I ate here it was just a off day but I have to say they have got progressively worse. I highly recommend not eating here I would choose any other African food place if you like good tasting quality food and not a stomach ache and 45 minutes in the bathroom. If I had 2 more thumbs I would give this place 4 thumbs down
1 star rating,I love the food here- it's nearly impossible to pick just one thing so we returned last night and I had the peanut stew and rice- just amazing and perfect for a chilly and rainy Friday night. We are in but most people take-out. There's plenty of space at high and low tables if you have a group.   You order at the counter but she brought our food to us which we didn't expect. Very nice of her. They now have take-away cocktails ($13) in the cooler on the counter and I bought their last gingery one- surprised how good it was for pre-made.  The guy that owns this place is really great too- met him through a Yelp cooking event- plus the fantastic food makes it easy to return again and again to support him.
5 star rating,"EL-LITE. I have waited MONTHS to try this place. I love Afro-Caribbean food but as far as I can remember I've never had some from a restaurant in Detroit. Only in Africa, the Caribbean and other cities lol. And this truly measured up! It tasted very authentic and cooked with love. But we melanated folks of Detroit cook everything with love. It warmed my heart and my soul. I literally brought some on the plane with me to eat as leftovers. 10/10 I highly recommend. The employees there also work very hard to keep up with the high demand! Kudos to you all and God BLESS for this God SENT motherland food."
4.5 star rating,"Yum Village is a great Detroit- born and bred Afro-Caribbean restaurant that is fresh, delicious and delightful!! Stopped in for a combo plate and the Executive Chef & owner, Godwin, was more than happy to tweak my order to make it keto-friendly. The pickled pepper garnish is so good- it should be offered as its own side dish!!  Super friendly service and food is on point!! Everything is made fresh so call ahead if you are in a rush- but it's definitely worth the wait."
5 star rating,"The only reason I'm writing this review is in hopes that it pushes the owner to DO BETTER. Flavor is the only thing done well at this restaurant. If you have other options for a meal, save yourself the frustration and go elsewhere.We've eaten here multiple times over the last few months since movingg to Detroit because it was recommended for having good food. The jerk chicken (when fresh) is delicious and I've only ""lucked up"" on the oxtails once and they were a little dry.  However, the service and overall experience is TERRIBLE, today is the last time I will ever order from this restaurant. We've experienced every possible bad scenario from this spot: wrong order, extremely long wait, order one thing then arrive to find out it's not available, bad customer service, no guidance or service from staff standing behind counter upon arrival, the list goes on and on.It's conveniently located in New Center but there is limited parking/space for pickup. The interior is unorganized and lacks an inviting feel. I'm not sure if it was ever intended for dine-in. 1 star for flavor 1 star for location"
2 star rating,"It pains me to write this review. I initially enjoyed eating here several years ago. I have always noticed issues with the operations, such as service being slow, workers being unprofessional, and overall disorganization, but both the food and service have gone seriously downhill since the pandemic. I remember last year, rather than giving me back my change, the guy at the register just said, ""Oh, is this for me? Thanks!"" and accepted it as his tip. Rude! The wait time for walk-in orders always took a long time, too. The pandemic just exacerbated problems that were already there that were never fixed. Still, I liked the food enough to give it another chance. The last time I came to YumVillage was in July 2020. Restaurants were allowed to reopen and I wanted to show my support. I remember a guy (not the owner) in the kitchen screaming at the woman working the register. It was absolutely appalling behavior. The food, already overpriced (nearly $20 for a bowl these days), decreased significantly in quality. What used to be delicious African style cheese bread was no longer. Instead, Pretzilla bread balls that can be found in the supermarket were used as a substitute with crusty cheese on top. The pretzel balls were as hard as rocks. Also, the workers were not wearing masks or not having them cover their mouths and noses. The service and food were a huge enough disappointment that it kept me away for longer than a year.I finally returned today with a Groupon voucher. There was a long line of people when I got there at lunchtime and it was absolute chaos. Once again, no masks on for most of the workers, including those in the kitchen. There is only one register and one person taking orders. The workers never seem to know what to do with Groupon vouchers even though YumVillage has been selling them off and on as early as 2019. This was maybe the third time I went there with a voucher and it still takes them a long time to figure out how to process it. Today it took at least 15 minutes for two workers to play around with the clover register while people behind me waited. I felt so bad. If anyone working here had common sense, one worker would have immediately taken other customers' orders while the second worker would have taken my Groupon code to process later and just subtracted the amount from the Groupon from my total.Several people stormed out of the restaurant. Other people who were there before I arrived stated that they waited up to an hour for their food. I had to wait for at least half an hour. A woman who looked like she works at a hospital told me she had been waiting for nearly an hour for two sides and she would not have any time to eat before her lunch break ends. She finally got her food after asking for her money back so she could leave. When I received my food, there were several mistakes. One side order was missing, I was given a smaller sized plate than what I had ordered, and the chicken bone-in rather than boneless as I had requested. When I told them this, they acted like it was going to be a huge hassle to give me what I had asked for. I just said ""forget it"" and left even though I probably paid more money for food I didn't receive. One worker I saw outside was at least apologetic and said he could give me more chicken. I thanked him but turned down his offer. I had already wasted enough of my lunch hour waiting for a simple order. The food wasn't great. The chicken was dry and overcooked. Some of the dishes were a bit too sweet for my taste. It felt like a rip off especially after the ordeal at the restaurant. The workers are so unprofessional. From what I can gather, the owner is stretching himself way too thin. He was there when all of this was occurring and didn't do much to control the situation. I think he should have apologized to the customers waiting and given them a gift card for a return visit. Many of these customers will not be returning and neither will I. There are already two new African/Caribbean restaurants that have opened within a half-mile radius. I know he is trying to do a lot by selling merchandise, doing cooking segments on the local news and at Yelp events, doing a podcast, and more, but my recommendation is to go back to the basics even if it means operating from a food truck again. Concentrate on delivering good quality food and service. Train workers on basic problem solving and customer service before having them handle the busy lunch shift. Don't be stingy when charging so much for a bowl of rice and a few pieces of chicken. If someone has waited for an hour, give them their food on the house. If something doesn't change, I don't see Yum Village surviving."
2 star rating,I wanted to check this place for a while but with the pandemic and restaurant closures I put it on a side. Finally decided to have s trip to Detroit and give it a try.Since it's about an hour drive from our house I decided to order many different options with a goal to have meals for 3 days and this way be able to try as many dishes as possible. I never had African food before so wanted from this trip as much as possible. Placed an order online on their website and was amazed how well everything was described on the site. It was very helpful for someone that is not familiar with African cuisine and shows that it was done with a lot of attention. Big plus for giving clear indication on vegan options. And pictures are amazing too.Curbside pick-up was easy and staff friendly. Everything was well packaged.The food itself was AMAZING! it's been a while since I had food from a restaurant that was so flavorful. You could truly taste that it was prepared with care and so much love. Lots of different and unknown flavors which can place you mentally in a cozy African home with somebody's mama cooking. I never had anything tasting like this and was so impressed. Definitely one of the best food experience I've had in years. There was no dish that we had and I didn't like. As a vegan I didn't try meats but my husband said they were very good too. One thing you need to know about this cuisine is that it loves spice and a combination of sweet and spicy or sweet and savory so be prepared for that. Flavors are so unique it can blow your mind. I'll definitely be back since there are still do many items I was not able to try and I'm very curious about them too.Highly recommend!
5 star rating,"While I havent had ""African"" food per say ( the way most reviewers have described Yum Village). I am Puerto Rican, My husband grew up in the Virgin islands, and Caribbean food is a daily staple in our house- I am very familiar with the flavors with cooking and with visiting restaurants. Maybe i didnt order the right things, but this way just Okay for me. Dont get me wrong- I would recommend this place, And I would go back to try again. But it wouldnt be a place that my mind immediately goes to. I tried the Curry Chicken and the Jerk Chicken. IMO, the curry chicken was tastier than the jerk- although the jerk did have plenty of flavor and i appreciated the heat. Both chickens tasted as if they had the sauce on the outside, but hadnt been marinated for long- if at all.  The rice (both coconut and jollof) were definitely good and cooked well. I liked the accompaniment of the hot cabbage slaw. OMG it was so spicy- but tasty and definitely a highlight. I think the most off putting element of my visit- was the service from the girls at the front. Cashiers and waitresses can make or break an experience, and frankly they were not professional at all. I understand that we are in a pandemic- and that it is strictly carryout, however, leggings, and slide sandals with mismatched socks isnt the best look. Being on your phone in full view of the waiting customers isnt the way to go. As I was waiting for my order of food to be found, there were putting coming in to place orders, and the cashier just went to her phone and began scrolling. Since I had checked out ( and noticed the line) I scooted even farther over, and said ""Did you want to take their orders while I wait"" and then she said Oh yeah- I can.  Umm, Oh yeah, you probably should. Let's just train the girls a bit better."
3 star rating,"If I could give 10 stars, I would! Yum Village is DELICIOUS beyond words, filled with flavors and LOVE! Godwin, the owner of Yum Village, is a pure beacon of light, and his passion for cooking and for Afro-Caribbean food shines through in everything that is done here. Everyone who works at Yum Village is happy to work there too, and it's just all around positive vibes every time I go - despite just going for curbside pick up! You can't go wrong with anything you order here! My favorites are the curry chicken, suya fried chicken, suya fried shrimp, corn cakes, elote, and ESPECIALLY the African style cheesy bread - holy moly do I love the cheesy bread! I personally cannot handle too much spice, so the jerk chicken and garlic parm chicken are both so delicious, but so much spicier than anything I can handle! The guava tahini chicken is also delicious if you like a little sweet with your savory - I'm a bit lacking in the sweet-tooth department so it wasn't my favorite, but again - SO FLAVORFUL! All in all, try Yum Village if you haven't already! It's a wonderful business, built with love, proudly in Detroit, black-owned, RIDICULOUSLY DELICIOUS - what's not to love?!?!?!?!"
5 star rating,Very low key dine in or carry out restaurant. They have shirts for sale and even have some carry out cocktails. I got the DJ Village combo and ate in. They probably do more carry out since they brought in a bag. I asked about eating in and she said it was ok.  I ordered the medium portion. It was plenty! My dish described as- Jezebel Peach Honey Mustard Chicken over Turmeric Rice served with Truffle Oil Greens and White Potato Flips. Not Spicy. So first- I did not try the greens and had okra and tomato dish. It was a little spicy. The main chicken dish was fragrant. I mean good delicious fragrant. The chicken was bone in- they may make it both ways since I thought I was asked and still got the bone in. Service was pretty quick considering this felt like a complex dish. My friend had peanut stew and rice. She also had a healthy portion. Parking is tricky since it's street. Don't forget to pay!
4 star rating,"Absolutely amazing. This is my first experience eating African food & I just want more. I've had jerk chicken, but the Lemon Jerk Chicken was so well flavored. I'm hooked on Jollof rice & Maafe. I love Panang Thai curry & this felt like the African equivalent & quite possibly a step above. Hearty, delicious, and amazing when you mix them together. If you don't try this place, you just don't want good food. Top Notch"
5 star rating,"Y'all I've been very sick for a week now and I think that Yum Village finally brought me out of it. I swear, it filled up my body and my spirit. After eating their food last night I woke up finally with some energy and my symptoms almost gone. It's healing. Alsoooo SO DELICIOUS!!! I can't emphasize it enough. The jerk chicken is so crispy, everything hit so hard. I really loved the fried fufu, so frickin tasty. Anything you get will be delicious. Also, they delivered my order a half an hour earlier than originally posted. Service was very quick! I saw some past reviews mentioning bad service but I had a great experience. Thanks for bringing me out of my sick hole and for providing what you do. It's so much more than food!!! Support this Black owned business! Y'all have something so special. Thank you!!!! Thank"
5 star rating,Some the best jerk chicken I've ever had. The meat was tender and the sauce was so flavorful. I ordered the combo plate which came with roasted plantains and jollof rice. Both were flavorful and perfectly cooked. My mouth was on fire but in a good way. The fact that the meat is halal is an added plus.The only negative I would say is that the plate was a bit pricey. But I'd rather have a quality dish for a higher prices than a bad one.Good effort guys! I will be back.
4.5 star rating,"I absolutely love this place and consider it a must stop whenever I'm in Detroit. The Maafe stew and coconut rice combination is the absolute best. As a vegan, I highly recommend this place because there are a lot of options for us. I cannot wait to get back to Detroit just for the stew and the mixed drinks."
5 star rating,"The customer service is beyond horrible. I walked in and the young lady with the ponytail at the register just stared at me. No hello or any type of greeting. As a paying customer, I should receive very basic customer service. I then told her that I had an online order, she didn't even let me finish my sentence and just rudely pointed to the side. Very poor customer service. The food is good but overpriced for the portion size."
3 star rating,"I wondered Into The Alley hungry and ready for anything.  I found this unassuming little stand right before the Skip Bar.... Imagine my surprise when I found some of the best food in Detroit from a cart!!! I had the jerk chicken , elote, and plantains it was all delicious and worth the pennies that I paid ( I would have paid 2x more ) now I had dinner and enough lunch for tomorrow.... Definitely coming back!"

2 star rating,I went to Yum Village after I left the African Festival where I did not buy food. Yum have had food from Yum Village before and knew I wanted to try it again. Interesting tasty food. On this visit I made multiple order. When I got home I was missing one of the items. I called back and spoke with Alex who put the  issue in a log for the manager. I called back ghe next week and spoke with Manager Godwin who was so pleasant and accommodating. He offered to replace the item or give me a gift certificate with more value than the item. I accepted the gift certificate because I live far away and usually don't go downtown. I really want the item so I know I'll have plan to go downtown in the future. Yum Village food is so good and customer service is exceptional. Aleta Roberts.

2 star rating,"2 stars because when it's good it's really good but It's just way too inconsistent for the price. The service, taste, price, and serving sizes seem to change every time I go. After spending $50 tonight for two small portions and a messed up order I think I'm done with them."
2 star rating,"Rude. Don't order through door dash. They claim they never received my order. I understand that, but it's a sense of customer care and not being rude when someone who is out $$ that they are trying to give it to your business."
1 star rating,"Been wanting to try this place for a while now. Ordered the lemon pepper jerk chicken, Jollof rice and corn cake. Everything was great!"
4.5 star rating,"I feel like I've driven by Yum Village so many times and always say, ""I'm going to go there next time I'm in the area."" Thankfully today was that day! I ordered online and scheduled for a later pickup. Picking up is so easy and quick. Also, their descriptions are super helpful and indicate vegetarian, vegan, and spice.The food is AMAZING. I ordered the Elder Village Combo since I've never had anything in it before and it's a perfect amount of spice. The corn cakes are a must order. Trust me. The regular (for any entree) is a very generous portion."
5 star rating,"Delightful when craving something ethnic and not your common local restaurant flavors. I love the staff and the owner/chef is a dear if you ever meet him.I've enjoyed Yum more than once, and I'll surely return more in the future."
5 star rating,"We could not have been happier with our first experience, which will by no means be the last. Having driven down from Port Huron we wanted to make the trip worthwhile and may have overdone it a bit, ordering nearly half the menu, but each and every dish was delicious and obviously prepared with great care and attention.The employees here were beyond helpful and gracious, going so far as to gift us juices, cake and their delicious seasoning because they were so excited we drove just to load up on some of the best food I've ever had.I just feel bad we're only now becoming Jollof Rice Fanatics and will no doubt be making up for lost time soon and regularly."
5 star rating,Orders take out for a meeting and everything was great. The jollof has a little kick but not too spicy. The lemon pepper chicken was nice and tender and juicy. I really wanted the roasted Brussels sprouts and will definitely continue to try other menu items.

4 star rating,"Wow. What a place.  I'd read a few positive reviews and had two acquaintances tell me about it, but it surpassed my already high expectations!  Friendly staff made the experience very enjoyable. They made us feel very welcome and had some great recommendations.  The food was incredible.  We had a boneless chicken dish with rice along with some sides that were truly a treat.  Extremely flavorful and very reasonably priced.  They recommended a cool drink, which we appreciated (iced tea helped with the hot seasoning!).  I'll definitely go back again and take more people with me.  I really want to try more!   Thank you all for such an amazing place!"
5 star rating,"I've been to 2 different events where YumVillage served delicious and flavorful food. I was very impressed with the flavors. I knew I wanted to come back here to try other items on the menu so that's exactly what I did. A week ago, I did a pick up order for a lamb shank. I was super excited because lamb is one of my favorite proteins. Once I brought it home and got ready to dig in on a feast, I opened my container and was very disappointed about what I got: one large bone, another bone, some sauce, and little bits of meat shreds. Where is all the meat? I got maybe 2 bites out of this from just draining out all the sauce and picking off little bits off the bone. This review is just solely on the lamb shank.I do love the guava tahini chicken."
2 star rating,Not at all worth the money. The jerk chicken the curry chicken the plantains the jollof the cheese bread everything was just awful. Money wasted. We didn't...Couldn't finish our food!
1 star rating,I had the (Maaef) stew for the first time and my god was it delicious. It was well seasoned and a moderate level of spiciness. I ordered online and the service was very speedy and the cashier was very friendly !! Oh and I also ordered a small order of plantain and it was delicious!! If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would.
4.5 star rating,"Been wanting to try this place for a while now. Ordered the lemon pepper jerk chicken, Jollof rice and corn cake. Everything was great!"
5 star rating,"The food is excellent! I also feel like it is healthy, but I'm not sure.  Friendly staff and you might even be able to purchase a bottle of your favorite black-owned liquor. They have a great selection of rums, cognac, and other spirits for sale by the bottle."
5 star rating,Delicious food enjoyed in a music filled space and positive vibes. Engaging and knowledgeable staff!
5 star rating,Great food and bomb service. They are currently only doing carry out. But still worth it I get the jerk chicken always a win with the Jollof rice. You can either call order in or grubhub.
4 star rating,"Due to a power outage the were not serving a full menu the time that we went. However, I was able to try the okra which was delicious. Nonetheless, I didn't like the djon djon rice (rice with black mushrooms). Which is a different version from the Haitian black rice. Honestly, it's an acquired taste. I threw mine out, my friend didn't like hers either.  Nevertheless, don't let my review deter you. They do have other amazing dishes on the menu. Maybe ask to sample the djon djon rice before buying it."
5 star rating,"I ordered the Cool Village combo today.  Curry Chicken, spicy rice and plantains.  It was my first experience there and they did not disappoint.  Ordered online and was ready by my short drive over.  Detroit has come a long way since I was a kid, need to keep it going and support local establishments."
5 star rating,"I want to like this restaurant because when you receive your food and it's right, it's delicious. But my past 2 experiences let me know that they don't know the meaning of customer service. I ordered 4 suya fried chickens and a side of plantains online for a 1:45pm pickup on February 23. When I arrived at YumVillage at 1:50, the employee at the counter told me ""your order's messed up"". I asked what that meant and he promptly walked off. The owner then came over and said unfortunately your order isn't ready and we'll make it now. I then waited for another 20 minutes with no explanation of the cause of the mixup. The owner did offer me a gift card for the inconvenience. I finally received my order and left. When I got home I opened the containers and realized they didn't give me suya fried chicken, but the smoked chicken dish instead. I ended up not eating anything and giving it to my family. I decided to go to YumVillage again because I had an appointment in the area and wanted to use the gift card. I placed my order online in advance because I saw on Instagram their oxtails sell out quickly. When I showed up on March 15, I looked at the pickup shelf and didn't see my order. I waited in line and explained to the employee that I placed an order online and it wasn't ready. Before he could respond the chef in the back shouted ""oh she ordered oxtails, we don't have anymore. we sold out"". I asked the employee why I wasn't notified before I drove to the restaurant and he had no reason. He advised me to not order online in advance because most people don't do it, except catering orders. He asked if I wanted something else and stated that all they had was jerk chicken. When I said no thanks, he suggested that I get to the restaurant when they open tomorrow to possibly get the oxtails. I don't live close so I'm not driving all the way tot restaurant for the off chance I'll get oxtails. I'm trying to figure out why YumVillage has online ordering if they don't recommend it. And why they wouldn't make the online prepaid orders first before selling items to people in person. I then requested a refund. I didn't receive an apology or explanation. I'm probably going to give the gift card to a friend because I don't plan on coming back."
1 star rating,"This place was okay and I'm glad I tried it. I ordered online and it seems that the menu online is limited and doesn't have everything you could get if you order in person or by calling in.I got a hot bowl with lemon jerk chicken, jollof rice, and the cheesy bread. I loved the jerk seasoning on the chicken! It was very spicy, which is great considering most places don't make their spicy food spicy enough. The chicken was tender, slightly sweet, and not overly salty at all. I would get it again.The rice seemed undercooked, but I couldn't tell if that's how it's supposed to be or if i'm used to stickier rice. It was garlicky and salty, and the flavor was nice. The cheesy bread was the side that sounded like it'd be satisfying but it was too greasy for me. I love greasy food and this was a bit much for me. Every bite oozed out oil and there was just a pool of oil in my mouth after each bite. The seasoning on the cheese was really good though and made it more than a typical cheesy bread.While some of the food wasn't to my preference, I would come back and try other things. The flavors made me think that if I were able to get something I ate more like brussels or greens or some of the stews, I'd like it more. I'm not sure why these aren't offered online, or maybe i just didn't see them as an option for the hot bowl. But the food was ready fast and service at pick-up was good too. Portions are decent too - a hot bowl and one side would definitely be enough. I will be back to try more things because i'm still intrigued."
3 star rating,"I had the opportunity to attend a tasting at yum village on 2/12/20. It was a part of a Yelp event so I thought long and hard about posting this review, but I gotta be honest, the experience was underwhelming and so was the food.The positives:Locally sourced foodCollaborative economics modelChef Godwin is super passionate and quite charmingReasonable pricesFree Parking Lot right behind the restaurant Should have license to serve beer & wine this monthEnvironmentally conscious features like wooden forksThe Food:We were offered 3 dishes to taste:Chicken wings over jollof turmeric riceGumbo over jollof turmeric rice w/ some kind of hushpuppie-like ballsShrimp w/ lemon polenta cakeFirst, i was shocked that in 2020 there was not a single vegetarian or vegan option served. Maybe they have options on the menu, but I felt like for a 3-dish tasting it would've been nice to taste that..... or a vegetable at all in fact.... any vegetable... a legume or cruciferous morsel of any manner would've sufficed.I found all three dishes to be way too starchy and heavy for my taste. I'm sure there are African dishes that incorporate vegetables. Also every dish was Reaaaally spicy/hot. Don't get me wrong I LOVE spicy food, but if you do not, BEWARE! I don't know if they offer varying ""heat"" when you order, but... yeah my mouth was tingling lol.The wings were good, but nothing special to go there for (Jolly Pumpkin if you're on woodward and want wings btw). The shrimp was rubbery and overcooked, I couldn't eat it. The lemon flavor in the polenta cake pretty much overpowered the whole thing. I couldn't eat it... and who serves a cake make of polenta ON TOP OF RICE! Guys, it was a whole night of carbs... and I love my carbs but geez, are we about to go plow ford field after this? We about to go powerlift? The best thing was the gumbo, but again, not special. I LOOOOOOVE gumbo.... all varieties.... this just wasn't it for me. The food was also not hot. Now i know it's a tasting, I don't expect piping hot fresh out the oven, but they appeared to be serving us ""real time"", so idk why everything was luke warm. For me luke warm food has already lost half the battle. Especially for fried foods like that shrimp.Loved the concept and really wanted to love this food, but I was not a fan. Wayyyyyy too many great restaurants on Woodward for this food to not BANG! They definitely have to step it up.Also, gotta get the bathrooms together!"
2 star rating,"Basically everything is gluten free and there are tons of vegan options, and perhaps most importantly it is all DELICIOUS! Like seriously so so good. Reasonably priced for how much food you get, too. A welcome addition to the Detroit food scene - can't wait to go back and try more stuff."
4.5 star rating,"I can't say enough good things. I haven't even finished putting the dishes away. Ordered delivery, came early, like Yelp said it be here later than I'm writing the review. Every single item was delicious and it was way more than enough for the group i ordered for. The plantains were the best I've ever had in Detroit, the stew was great, the chicken was deliciousOrder everything right now, you'll love it"
5 star rating,One of the most flavorful meals I've ever had. Super recommend anything with the jerk chicken or the corn cakes.
5 star rating,"By far the most flavorful and fresh food I've ever experienced. I almost got emotional after first tasting. Yum Village is my first experience with African cuisine and I feel like I've missed out my whole life. Phenomenal flavor, and extremely cool staff and chefs. Plenty of naturally vegan options as well."
5 star rating,"I have always been looking for a place that sold Jerk Chicken as I have never had it before and was very curious about it. I am in love with spices and spicy food so when I heard that there was a Caribbean dish that would most definitely meet those needs and desires I was on the hunt for it. I was pointed in the direction of yum village by a friend of mine who is a foodie and he said it was really good. So on to the food I ended up just ordering the Jerk Chicken and I was excited to get it home to give it a try. The price was not so bad and the portion size was not bad either. The quality and flavor of the food however, was amazing it was fantastic bursting with flavor and lots of pieces of chicken and veggies. I have been craving it ever since to be honest. the only reason I am giving it 3 stars at this point was because of the online ordering system. I don't have very good data on my phone so ordering was close to impossible. I ended up calling it in and the person who took my order reluctantly took the order. The wait time for the food was reasonable and the food was hot and delicious. Overall make sure you order online if possible they are pretty serious about that as they only have the one phone line, the portions where neither great or bad for the price, depending on who you interacted with the staff was either really friendly or kind of rude (the person who took my phone call was really trying to rush me to place my order and was not too happy that I could not place the order online. But there was a man who greeted me outside while I waited to make sure everything was being handled ok and was very friendly.) So it's worth a try if your in the area the food is good and the wait time is decent as of the last time I went in June they where not open for inside dining so carry out was the only option things may have changed now."
3 star rating,"The customer service is beyond horrible. I walked in and the young lady with the ponytail at the register just stared at me. No hello or any type of greeting. As a paying customer, I should receive very basic customer service. I then told her that I had an online order, she didn't even let me finish my sentence and just rudely pointed to the side. Very poor customer service. The food is good but overpriced for the portion size."
3 star rating,"Was invited to one of the fabulous Yelp events for elite Yelpers so that's how I found this wonderful gem.  We didn't order, we were served sampling's of corn balls, chicken wings, shrimp, rice.  Every dish (on eco-friendly plates and utensils) was cooked and spiced to perfection.  Godwin, Thorpe owner and chef spoke to us. His enthusiasm and passion for this type of food and for the up and coming Detroit restaurant community was infectious and exciting. My date works at Quicken Loans and YumVillage has catered some events. She said the food at those events was wonderful!!!   There was easy and safe street parking and two clean unisex bathrooms to use.  I'd definitely go back for a full meal"
5 star rating,Best place to find West African and Caribbean comfort food. Godwin is the perfect host and his food makes you feel family and friends all around. Bits amazing flavor. Come try and don't leave without taking some corncakes home!
5 star rating,It's a nice healthy option. Everything is fresh and has flavor. Spice is  sometimes but worth it for the flavor. I've gotten two hot plates with jerk chicken with plantains one time. And lemon jerk with no leaf salad the second time. The plantains are ok - more like tostones vs a ripe sweet plantain taste. But the hint of spice on it is nice. The no leaf salad is my favorite. The chicken definitely has spice!!! Be warned if you're not spice friendly The only negative is the wait time. For appearing to be fast food type - they need a little more organization. I've ordered both times online but the wait is basically the same as walking in IMO. Perhaps have another line for customers to walk up and collect to go orders for quick lunch break.

4 star rating,"New Center's latest addition! The yum in their name holds truth, let me tell you that. They describe themselves as a ""delivery-focused, quick-casual restaurant"" and the service is indeed quick! Located on the corner of Woodward and E Milwaukee, the restaurant has plenty of seats to sit in to enjoy authentic Afro-Caribbean food. On arrival, the owner and workers quickly gave me a very warm welcome.Their menu is very straight forward and you can't go wrong for the $10 combo meal. Jerk chicken was well seasoned and tender with delicious sauce on top. Curry chicken with a side rice is very good too. Portions are nice size. Smoked and pepper fries were A+. Everything was devoured. I also love how eco-friendly everything is, from the containers to the utensils. Plus, they have halal/gluten-free/vegan options too!"
5 star rating,"I've been hearing awesome things about Yumvillage, so I decided to give it a try! Honestly, the food is amazing. The jerk chicken is juicy and tender and the spices are insane! Also, the chickpeas and plantains were particularly yummy!! The portions are generous (enough for lunch and dinner!) and the prices were reasonable. The reason I gave it 3 stars is for my experience with the online ordering system. I placed an order for curbside pickup. When I arrived, I called and  was told that my order wasn't ready yet, so I waited in my car for 10 minutes before calling again to check up on it. This time, I spoke with someone else, who said that they were not able to find any order associated with my name. I told them the pickup time and offered the confirmation number. This went on for a several minutes before the staff member went and got the owner. The owner was able to eventually find the order and told me that they would start making the food. I waited in the car for another 20 minutes, and the food finally came out roughly 40 minutes after my supposed pickup time (kind of rough since I was trying to go on a break during the workday). My guess is that the online ordering system is not really well integrated, so I would recommend calling instead of the online process instead."
4.5 star rating,"Delicious food, disposable compostable plates, community art chalk boards, prompt service.Worth every penny!"
5 star rating,"I really liked Yum Village!  My favorite part was the akara (like a hush puppy kind of), the curry chicken, and the plantains - you can never go wrong with plantains!  The Jolloff rice was spicyyyy!  If you're not into spicy stuff you might want to get the turmeric rice.  I would definitely come back here again!"
5 star rating,This food was AMAAAAAAAAAZING! The flavoring was ON POINT! I have never had better flavored food. Got the lemon pepper jerk wings and jollof rice. I literally couldve licked the containers that the food came in it was that good!
5 star rating,"Soooo good. I loved my meal. I'm a big fan of African and Caribbean food so when I heard this place was in my area I knew I'd have to give it a try eventually. I ordered a detroit hot bowl with mango chicken and curry chickpeas that was very filling and flavorful. I was worried that 1 protein and 1 side wouldn't be enough for $12, but it was actually the perfect amount for me. I would definitely eat here again when restaurants re open for dine in service, but for now I'll continue to support with takeout."
5 star rating,"Pretty good, but everything tastes slightly too sweet. The owner was making better food when he was just in a food truck, in my opinion. Not great, but it seems like fresh healthy food."
3 star rating,"Yesterday was the first time I have had their food at their restaurant location.  I have had their food in the past at the Head Wrap Expo.   I got the Roots Village Combo.  It was very tasty, but the curry was a little bitter.  I also got the Peanut Butter Brownie cookie, it was good, but a little too sweet for my taste. There is definitely room for improvement in terms of customer service and the cleanliness of the bathrooms.  When I walked in no one greeted me, no one directed me where  to order, there was no menu posted, and no one directed me to the menu.  I did find where to order and the menu on my own, there was one small sheet that had the QR code by the register.  I also noticed a lot of flies buzzing around the kitchen.  The service was very slow and the two men in front of me seemed to take about 10-15 minutes just to order, the man at the register didn't even acknowledge that I was there waiting.  When I ordered I was not asked what size I wanted, I was disappointed when I saw that I was charged $16.50 instead of $11 for a small size, which was my preference.   My food was ready in about 10 minutes which wasn't bad, however I saw that the man in front of me was complaining that part of his order was missing. The biggest issue I had was the bathrooms.  Both toilets were dirty and when I see a dirty bathroom in a restaurant it makes me question the cleanliness of the kitchen.  I was so disgusted by the nasty bathrooms that I couldn't use them and went to Baobab Fare's and used theirs instead (since I had just eaten there).   The bathrooms are also close to the kitchen.   So, instead of enjoying my food hot, I came home and put it in the fridge because I was too disgusted to try it.  However, I did try it this morning and it was good, however, due to the customer service issue and lack of cleanliness in the bathrooms I probably will not be back."
3 star rating,"We finally made it to Yum Villiage! Eating here is like taking your taste buds on a really fun field trip! The food was absolutely outstanding, as was the service. I had the Jerk Chicken bowl and it was extraordinary. It came with rice, and a full bowl of honey dipped deep fried chickpeas. This place is all about flavor, every bite was so enjoyable. The dinning area was extremely clean and well maintained, sanitizer is available and the staff seemed to be following good hygiene and safety standards. The owner is extremely friendly and welcoming, he definitely makes you feel like your business is appreciated. I was highly impressed with the entire experience. It's amazing how he turned this former Popeyes into this incredible dinning destination. I'll most certainly will be back!"
5 star rating,"I struggled over this rating because I've had their food at a popup a couple years ago and it was excellent. I just got jerk chicken with all the sides for the Free press top 10 takeover. I was disappointed, they missed an opportunity to shine to a mass of people. For the most part the spicing was good but then there was the ""mashed popatoes? "" that had no flavor at all, I'm not sure it was potatoes. . Every dish was also killed with corn starch (some thinking agent), so all the dishes came out like goo.  The Chicken was undercooked , way undercooked. The rib tips had nearly no meat, just a few large bones.  The okra was boiled to death, again goo. I will be going back because I know they can do much better than this. See you again soon guys , hoping this was a one time mess up."
3 star rating,"First timers-ordered pickup on 4/10/2021. First of all, the ordering/pickup process is a bit of a mess. There doesn't seem to be an obvious system which makes the customers anxious and creates a tense vibe in the restaurant which isn't ideal when trying something for the first time. However, to be fair there was a spot about them on the news that morning and they might not have been expecting quite such a rush.All that said, the food is so good I'm still giving Yum Village 5 stars. The food is full of flavor, nice heat, perfectly cooked. We got the jerk chicken, garlic Parmesan chicken, jollof rice, turmeric rice, corn cakes and akara. Everything is on the spicy side, so steel yourself. But the depth of flavor and unique combinations are definitely worth the trip and the wait. Will be back for sure."
5 star rating,I love the Jerk chicken bowl with Jollof. It's so tasty. I get hints of sweetness with powerful kicks of spice. This is my preferred go-to restaurant for quality and decently priced Caribbean food. I recommend ordering ahead with this app or online if you're doing lunch.
4.5 star rating,"Great authentic Jamaican food place! I ordered the lemon pepper jerk chicken and the sweet plantains. Delicious! The lemon pepper chicken was spicy, even though they said it wasn't ""as spicy,"" but I still enjoyed it. Would definitely go back and recommend to others!"
5 star rating,"My first visit to Yum Village was three weeks ago. I had the Suya Chicken, it was great. My second visit I had the Corn Cake (s)  they were delicious. My third visit on 06.29.2021, I had the Suya Chicken again, unfortunately it was poor quality."
1 star rating,"I've been curious about this spot for a while now because I love so close.On a rainy Friday afternoon, I was wondering what I would have for dinner. The hard part is that I'm vegetarian, but I heard that this place had vegetarian options as well, so why not.It's a casual dine in restaurant. It was clean and my order was taken right away. I waited only about 5 minutes. I ordered the Akara-black bean fritter, plantains and Jollof rice. It was pretty tasty, especially the plantains. It was a bit on the pricey side (17$ plus tax) for a casual dine in place- but overall I did like the food and I will be back."
5 star rating,"The food here is bomb! I especially love the maafe over tumeric rice. The only issue is the past three times I've gotten this the tumeric rice was slightly undercooked and therefore a bit crunchy (not in a good way), but I still eat it because it's delicious. I wish they had actual suya--the suya fried chicken doesn't taste like the suya I'm used to at all but it's still really good. Also the fried plantains are perfect and the lemon jerk chicken is so good. I get yumvillage at least once a week now  my comfort food!"

5 star rating,"Yum Village is absolutely incredible! Hands down, it's one of the most unique restaurants in Detroit. The mix of sweet & spice in every dish can satisfy everyone. I love that there are so many vegan friendly options however the jerk chicken & the African cheese bread is out of this world! Perfect for take out. The orders are packaged in reusable packaging which is great as well. I cannot recommend Yum Village enough! It's a must try!"
5 star rating,"I really hate to do this. But... the food i got from YumVillage was just gross. I ordered the plantains and the African cheese bread. Both tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for 5 hours; hard, saturated grease and cold. My order was carry out. But my destination was only 10 minutes from YumVillage. No excuse for this. The only things salvageable from my order are the actual carry out containers. At least i can use those for meal prepping. ‍"
1 star rating,"Oh my goodness, how my husband and I love YumVillage. The food is SO flavorful. I've tried the corn cakes, plantain, tumeric and jollof rice, jerk chicken, curry chicken, fried chicken, fries. I LOVED EVERY DISH. You really can't go wrong here. Just know that the jerk chicken really is spicy, don't underestimate it. Every time I go there's lots of space, it's designed beautifully inside. And the owner is always there, quite a delightful guy. A nice place to take a visitor, or just stop by for some grub."
5 star rating,"If you like spicy food, then you have got to try this! It's spicy with FLAVOR. Im vegetarian and like to get a bunch of small sides to try and my husband likes the jerk chicken. We order from the website and get it curbside."
5 star rating,"Great stuff. Jerk chicken is next level and also does not mess around in the spice category in the slightest (but it seems to vary quite a bit depending on how they cook it)-- jollof rice pairs nicely. I love the pepper salad, and the ginger chickpeas, which are sort of pan-fried and crunchy. Plantains are solid. I saw a pic of greens on this thread, and I'd love to try them (but I don't know if I've seen them on the menu?). African Cheesy Bread was nothing to write home about, but they do have these little corn cake things that are great."
5 star rating,"The kitchen was chaos as staff argued about how to complete my order, which was missing certain items. At one point someone told somebody else to ""just microwave it"". After waiting for more than half an hour, I was told by the employee at the cash register, that my food was ""not hot"". That's not a good situation when they were supposed to have been cooking it for the last 30 minutes. (Their phone and online messages to customers say that food will be ready in less than 15 minutes after an order is placed.) I told him that I would like to cancel the order. He said ""I think that's a good idea"". I did not however receive a credit to the card that I used to pay more than $60 for the food that I ordered but never received. When I called to inquire about receiving a credit for the botched order, the employee on the phone (not the one at the register last night) began arguing with me about how I ""walked out after my order was completed."" That is patently false. The food was not ready when I left the establishment. Worst, most belligerent customer service ever. Never again."

5 star rating,"On average, I come here about 3/4 times a week so you could say it was my favorite restaurant. Today, I ordered the jezebel chicken which was dry and overcooked. Also placed an order for the suya chicken and jollof rice. The suya chicken was tasteless and the recipe changes all the time. Sometimes it's coated in a thick peanut rub, barely there peanut rub, or just flour. The jollof was super oily as well. I hate to leave this review because I love Carribean food and the fact that yumvillage is invested in building a community. However, the quality is not consistent and it pains me to pay for food that is good maybe 60/70% of the time. The jezebel chicken I had today was so overcooked my stomach was upset for several hours. I've worked in a restaurant before and I understand things happen every now and then but those margins just don't work for me here as it's become more a gamble than a guarantee that I'll be able to enjoy my meal. I'll try again in a couple months, if someone else buys."
2 star rating,The chefs are super amazing and very welcoming. Incredibly good vibes/food and I like my plantains spicy now
5 star rating,"Best jerk chicken I've ever had. Recommend this place 100%, don't miss out! Also check out plantains and chickpeas!"
5 star rating,"Wow the food is so good - tried the lemon jerk chicken, seafood gumbo, chick peas (the best!) and the curry chicken. I had to get takeout given the current circumstances but I was very impressed with the service and hospitality of the staff. Will definitely come back again and again."
5 star rating,Some of the most flavorful food I've ever had! Incredible! Wonderful hospitality as well.
5 star rating,I'm so mad and hungry!! Just paid nearly $16 for a bowl of rice and plantains...there was literally one little chunk of chicken. Food was so unseasoned I had to use a whole packet of salt! I used to love this place...I won't be returning
1 star rating,Over priced and the food was bland.  Uses a lot of disposable plastics.  Was so looking forward to eating here.  Very disappointed.
2 star rating,Yum Village was amazing. The food was well thought out and tasted the part as well. The owner is very friendly would highly recommend!!
4.5 star rating,Ordered carry out from YV for the first time last week and everything was beyond delicious. Can't wait to work our way through the rest of the menu and become regulars.
5 star rating,"Excellent flavor, authentic and fresh food. Please check them out and support local! Jerk chicken is spicy, with a strong kick of black pepper. Plantains are the perfect  type of glaze and sweet. True home cooked cooking!"
5 star rating,"I started eating at yum village in summer 2020 and they have quickly become my go to spot. Every single bite on the plate is exceptional. Hats off to the chef and entire staff. I normally order the elder village with corn cakes and mango sauce. Anytime someone visits me, I treat them to yum village and they are always impressed. Five stars!!!!"
5 star rating,"YumVillage has great food. The staff is really friendly and personable.  On Saturdays they have live entertainment at 8p. This was my first  YumVillage experience, but definitely won't be the last. YumVillage is definitely yummy!"
5 star rating,Very first time trying Afro-Caribbean food and I've heard great things about Yum Village and I must say they live up to the hype!!! The spices and flavors are so amazing!! The jolloff rice with the maafe!!  Sheesh!! So good and the lemon pepper jerk chicken was amazing!! Not to mention it's a black-owned business!! Highly recommend for sure!! Lol I'm definitely going to keep the hype going and can't wait to experience the rest of the menu!
5 star rating,"Incredible food, full of flavor and spice. I liked the short rib best. It was tender and the rice was incredible."
5 star rating,"Best jerk chicken I've ever had. Recommend this place 100%, don't miss out! Also check out plantains and chickpeas!"
5 star rating,Some of the most flavorful food I've ever had! Incredible! Wonderful hospitality as well.
5 star rating,"Had the chicken and waffles special on the weekend. They gave me a choice of a mix chicken (thighs and drumsticks or all drumsticks), i chose all drumsticks. The portions were smaller than expected but fair with the price. But it was very good. Husband had the jerk chicken and that was very flavorful but too spicy for me ( but that isn't saying too much because i have a very low tolerance for spice)"
5 star rating,"What an experience today.  Placed an online order, paid for it which automatically included a Tip, which was not a problem or so I thought.  Online said order would be ready at 12:40 pm.  Arrived at 12:45 and there were three other people waiting outside.  A Man was taking names and phone numbers. Waited and Waited and waited................Received my food at 1:40 pm.  Would have left if the food had not already been paid for.  So I guess I tipped for the wait.  With the exception of the roasted Brussel sprouts (which were still very raw)  the food was good which is why I gave 2 stars.  The service was so disappointing.  Don't think I will be returning."
4.5 star rating,"This place was okay and I'm glad I tried it. I ordered online and it seems that the menu online is limited and doesn't have everything you could get if you order in person or by calling in.I got a hot bowl with lemon jerk chicken, jollof rice, and the cheesy bread. I loved the jerk seasoning on the chicken! It was very spicy, which is great considering most places don't make their spicy food spicy enough. The chicken was tender, slightly sweet, and not overly salty at all. I would get it again.The rice seemed undercooked, but I couldn't tell if that's how it's supposed to be or if i'm used to stickier rice. It was garlicky and salty, and the flavor was nice. The cheesy bread was the side that sounded like it'd be satisfying but it was too greasy for me. I love greasy food and this was a bit much for me. Every bite oozed out oil and there was just a pool of oil in my mouth after each bite. The seasoning on the cheese was really good though and made it more than a typical cheesy bread.While some of the food wasn't to my preference, I would come back and try other things. The flavors made me think that if I were able to get something I ate more like brussels or greens or some of the stews, I'd like it more. I'm not sure why these aren't offered online, or maybe i just didn't see them as an option for the hot bowl. But the food was ready fast and service at pick-up was good too. Portions are decent too - a hot bowl and one side would definitely be enough. I will be back to try more things because i'm still intrigued."
3 star rating,Food is amazing! Loved the Jerk chicken. Next time I'm back in Detroit I will be eating there! I enjoyed the ambiance and the amazing smells that hit me when I entered the door.
4 star rating,"Delightful when craving something ethnic and not your common local restaurant flavors. I love the staff and the owner/chef is a dear if you ever meet him.I've enjoyed Yum more than once, and I'll surely return more in the future."
5 star rating,Take a new friend every time I got. Rice and beans fire. Good music. The workers are so nice! Best food for taste and health downtown. They support the youth so much! Greens are the #1 reason to eat here!
5 star rating,Delicious! No wait to place our order and the guy behind the counter was super helpful. We tried the lemon pepper jerk chicken AMAZING!! The chicken was tender and full of flavor. Also the African cheese bread was EVERYTHING!! So good I would recommend it! Overall this place has amazing food and a nice laid back atmosphere! Definitely will be back!
5 star rating,"The jollof was great, however there was nothing ""suya"" about the chicken. The jerk was okay, but it tasted like Walkerswood. Overall flavorful with nice portions."
4 star rating,SOOOO GOOD. finally got to try it and they exceeded my expectations!!!!!  I'm so grateful that they have vegan options! very satisfying and flavorful; The customer service from the counter was top notch! They helped me order + they even stayed open until the very last minute for me. I came in at 7:59 and got the same service I would have gotten at 5pm etc. would totally recommend. P.s This is not a paid review
5 star rating,Honestly I was super disappointed! If you like really spicy this is the place for you! The food was definitely flavorful but was so spicy I couldn't eat it. My boyfriend loves spicy food and it took him a bit to eat it even though he was crying from the heat. They offered another plate and when we got the second it wasn't nearly as hot and was more tolerable for even me. So I'm not sure what happened between the first plate/second!
3 star rating,"I sampled some of their food at a Yelp event and I immediately fell in love. The food is spicy, filling, and has TONS of flavor. Being Bengali (South Asian), I even thought the Jollof rice was spicy so beware! The Jerk Chicken and Suya Fried Chicken were great; never dry or bland."
5 star rating,"Went here on a lunch break today. Had jerk lemon chicken, fries served mild, and plantains. Probably too much food -- meat + 1 side would have been plenty. Still ate it all because of how flavorful and amazing everything was. In fact, I almost ate my fork. Now I can barely breathe and will probably regret being such a damn glutton. Oh, and the staff is really nice and friendly and patient with new customers waffling about their food choices and changing their mind."
4.5 star rating,The jerk chicken and turmeric rice was spicy & delicious. Haven't tried anything else yet. Staff was friendly. Restaurant was clean. I will definitely be back to try some other dishes. Great addition to the New Center area!
5 star rating,"I move to Detroit a few months ago, believing over the last year that I would not find good Carribean favor up North. Well, Yumvillage changed that. I got the chickpea and curry chicken with plantains.  Good favor, spicy and sweet and salty."

5 star rating,"Upon entering I was greeted by the nice Man behind the counter who was very helpful since I told him I had never been their. I ordered the fish stew which for me was somewhat salty ( but again in my opinion) and the Black eye pea fritter was just okay for me, I also ordered the Jollof and Thyme rice which I wish I would have gotten the Thyme rice only because the Jollof was too hot for me. I would try them again and next time I will stay away from the spicy hot items. And to add I received my to go orders in what appeared to be containers made from recycled materials which is a plus for me and in my opinion helpful to out environment."
4 star rating,"Very pricey but overall the food, atmosphere, and customer service was great. The food is very flavorful."
4 star rating,"I don't Yelp very much, but when I do, something has to seriously motivate me. 5 stars isn't enough! I highly suggest the Curry Chicken with Turmeric Rice combo! Oh, and the staff is super accommodating! You'd be a fool not to try it for yourself."
5 star rating,"Yum Village needs to add another Yum to their name. It's been a while since I have given out a 5-star rating, but this one is well deserved! This is my 5th trip here in less than a month. Each time the food has been absolutely on point. The service is warm and welcoming. Devon, who has taken my order just about everytime has been great. When you enter, you're greeted like you're coming home. The menu is concise, but has great options for varied tastes.  In all fairness, I've only tried the Lemon-pepper jerk chicken, Curry chicken, African-style cheesy bread, Tumeric rice and Ginger-Curry chickpeas. If the other items on the menu are even close to these, you won't be disappointed. The chicken has always been juicy and tender with just the right amount of spice. They serve fountain drinks along with health conscious beverages, like coconut waters and specialty teas. Parking is a little tricky, because the only thing available is on the street. Don't let that stop you. Even though their Yelp page currently shows that they close at 5pm, they have extended their hours to include dinner and are now open until 8pm Tuesday- Saturday. Don't forget to leave your mark on the giant chalkboard!"
5 star rating,I stopped in today to see what this restaurant was and I'm so happy I made that decision. The restaurant is cute and an open concept that feels breezy. The food is what is the show stopper though. After watching the menu flash before my eyes on the screen for several minutes I finally read it and decided on what to get. The jerk chicken and joolof rice are the perfect combo. It's a bit spicy and the flavors are on point. The best part is all of their food is locally sourced and they use compostable food containers and utensils
4 star rating,Food is amazing! Loved the Jerk chicken. Next time I'm back in Detroit I will be eating there! I enjoyed the ambiance and the amazing smells that hit me when I entered the door.
4.5 star rating,"Amazing...To overuse a quote "" total trip to flavor town"". Service was super fast, counter staff knew everything. Can't wait to go back. Go there, total flavor party"
5 star rating,"Wow! We had heard good things about their food truck but never had a chance to try it.  Now they've opened a restaurant on Woodward so we had our chance yesterday.  Definitely the best African/Caribbean food in Detroit.  Yum Village is a nice mix of the two.  For the past year we've tried nearly every African restaurant in the city and always left disappointed.  The same for the Jamaican or Trini restaurants that have popped up over the past couple of years.  Most of them just really aren't that good.  Yum Village is the opposite.  This is the real thing with intense flavors, large portions for the price and a very friendly staff & owner.  We had the chicken curry and the jerk chicken with jollof rice and everything was amazing.  We can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu."

5 star rating,"Wish I had taken pictures of what I got, but I went to the New Center restaurant twice and both times, the staff was superb and the food was sooooooo good and most importantly, high quality.  Absolutely love their fried plantains.  they definitely could charge more for the suya fried chicken, got two big thighs and a leg with my bowl order.  Btw, the food pairs wonderfully with beer."
5 star rating,"On average, I come here about 3/4 times a week so you could say it was my favorite restaurant. Today, I ordered the jezebel chicken which was dry and overcooked. Also placed an order for the suya chicken and jollof rice. The suya chicken was tasteless and the recipe changes all the time. Sometimes it's coated in a thick peanut rub, barely there peanut rub, or just flour. The jollof was super oily as well. I hate to leave this review because I love Carribean food and the fact that yumvillage is invested in building a community. However, the quality is not consistent and it pains me to pay for food that is good maybe 60/70% of the time. The jezebel chicken I had today was so overcooked my stomach was upset for several hours. I've worked in a restaurant before and I understand things happen every now and then but those margins just don't work for me here as it's become more a gamble than a guarantee that I'll be able to enjoy my meal. I'll try again in a couple months, if someone else buys."
2 star rating,The chefs are super amazing and very welcoming. Incredibly good vibes/food and I like my plantains spicy now
5 star rating,"So delicious! Ended up here on a recommendation from a vegan friend who was impressed with the restaurants sustainable practices. When we arrived there was a very cool open mic night going on and lots of families. We got the jerk chicken, the lemon pepper jerk chicken, the jollof, the plantains and got a complementary order of the African cheese bread due to a longer than normal wait. I couldn't believe it! The chicken was so tender and both of the jerk sauces were the perfect amount of spicy and sweet. The jollof was seasoned to perfection and the fried plantains had the best texture. Crispy but soft on the inside. The African cheese bread was so addicting I couldn't stop eating it even after I was full from everything else. We ended up with leftovers to spare and I'm getting excited thinking about heating them up tomorrow as I'm typing this."
5 star rating,"Just ate at the brick and mortar on Woodward. Everything was so delicious. Loved the cheesy bread, the jolloff rice, the plantains, the maafe, all of it. My coworkers raved about it. Will be adding this to our lunch rotation for sure."
5 star rating,"Good was amazing! Huge portion for the price, great service. Can't wait to go back again"
5 star rating,"Incredible food, incredible flavor, incredible spice! Everyone at the counter was so polite and helpful in explaining each dish. We had an excellent experience and will be back!!"
5 star rating,Yum Village was amazing. The food was well thought out and tasted the part as well. The owner is very friendly would highly recommend!!
4.5 star rating,"New Center's latest addition! The yum in their name holds truth, let me tell you that. They describe themselves as a ""delivery-focused, quick-casual restaurant"" and the service is indeed quick! Located on the corner of Woodward and E Milwaukee, the restaurant has plenty of seats to sit in to enjoy authentic Afro-Caribbean food. On arrival, the owner and workers quickly gave me a very warm welcome.Their menu is very straight forward and you can't go wrong for the $10 combo meal. Jerk chicken was well seasoned and tender with delicious sauce on top. Curry chicken with a side rice is very good too. Portions are nice size. Smoked and pepper fries were A+. Everything was devoured. I also love how eco-friendly everything is, from the containers to the utensils. Plus, they have halal/gluten-free/vegan options too!"
5 star rating,"I've been curious about this spot for a while now because I love so close.On a rainy Friday afternoon, I was wondering what I would have for dinner. The hard part is that I'm vegetarian, but I heard that this place had vegetarian options as well, so why not.It's a casual dine in restaurant. It was clean and my order was taken right away. I waited only about 5 minutes. I ordered the Akara-black bean fritter, plantains and Jollof rice. It was pretty tasty, especially the plantains. It was a bit on the pricey side (17$ plus tax) for a casual dine in place- but overall I did like the food and I will be back."

5 star rating,This place is amazing! Like you can't tell me otherwise. I will be here more often! The Chef is simply amazing! The seasoning is on point! The spic the options & proportions! The staff is so helpful and friendly to assist you with what to get if you're confused on what to get. This is African-Caribbean cuisine which you don't see to many of these joints laying around! So make sure to take advantage of this place now before the line is out the door and they sell out of food! Yum Village didn't come to disappoint! Please visit and order your heart out. The ingredients are fresh and amazing!

5 star rating,"Everything is gluten free and all the sides are vegan! Perfect for me as an event planner for very picky eaters, people on Whole 30, and people with multitudes of dietary restrictions. Really takes the pressure off of me. Not to mention DELICIOUS! Superb customer service by owner, Godfred, and Chef Elahu. 5 stars in taste, presentation, timeliness and quantity."
5 star rating,"Just had catering from Yum Village at a meeting. The food is A-MA-ZING! All the dishes are high end culinary plays on traditional West African or Caribbean dishes, and everything was fantastically executed and didn't stray too far from the flavor profile of the original/traditional dish. The chef and owner gave a loving presentation of all of the dishes, which added so much to the experience. Will absolutely be visiting the brick and mortar on my next trip to Detroit!"
5 star rating,"The food is fantastic, the service is solid and the prices are very reasonable. Nice to have a food truck doing something really unique and the staff definitely works their tails off to make it happen!"
5 star rating,"The colorful food truck with phenomenal eats! Yum Village offers delicious, responsibly sourced, tastes of Nigeria & the Caribbean! As someone who does not always consume meat, I was thrilled to discover that their menu is 75% vegetarian, alongside 2 sinfully spicy or flavorfully mild meat options. The menu boasts a fantastical mix and match rice-bowl vibe; a combination that never tires and keeps me coming back for more! Definitely experience the jollof rice and plantain--out of this world!"
4.5 star rating,"Had a chance to try these guys out at ""Tour De Fork"" this year. What a phenomenal job!!! They ""WOWED"" me with their flavorful jerk chicken and Jallof rice. Authentic doesn't begin to describe what I encountered today trying their jerk chicken. It was simply amazing. Thanks again and I'll be stalking your food truck soon."
