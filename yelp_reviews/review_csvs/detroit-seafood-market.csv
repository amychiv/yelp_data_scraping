2.5 star rating,"Brunch:  some friends and I decided to visit for brunch.  First, it was 6 of us and the cost was 37.00 .  This included gratuity and tax.  That was really pricey!!! You get two Mimosas with you food.  Those taste like juice so really you are getting orange juice in s glass.  The omelet station:  my omelet was just ok..they have slot of ingredients so you can pick and choose.  The food options was breakfast (no eggs) to soul food.  Chicken, catfish, greens, very cheesy Mac and cheese, ribs....The music was wonderful!!! They had a musician that we all really enjoyed.  It wasn't that crowded!!! I gave two stars because the price and the food didn't match!!!"
3 star rating,"This was our second visit and unfortunately I wished we would've picked a different restaurant for dinner. We were not aware that there would be a special Sweetest Day menu which only offered a small amount of options for dinner. The food was not what we had expected or experienced from our first visit.  We waited almost 45 minutes for our food to come and once it came we were not impressed. The waitress was very attentive but when asked questions about the menu she wasn't too knowledgeable and stated that she had just found out that day about the special Sweetest Day menu. Although dinner wasn't the best my date still ordered dessert..big mistake! The peach cobbler was awful! The only positives that we experienced was the fact that we were sat immediately after arrival (we did have reservations) and the drinks were good. It's safe to say that this was our last visit. Also, that 50% discount for checking in is for Happy Hour which it's already 50% off!"
2 star rating,"So disappointing. Do not come here if you want extremely sub-par food and slow service. Visited yesterday around 8 pm and bought a $130 groupon for a 4 person meal (2 appetizers, 4 entrees, 4 desserts) because it seemed like such a good deal. Do not be fooled!!Appetizers:-Romaine salad: the croutons are so stale that it seemed like they were left in the open for many days. The lettuce and ranch is good though. -Shrimp scampi portion: extremely small and tastes sour, not tasty at all. These 2 are definitely not appetizers for 4 people. Entrees: we got one of each on the groupon menu.-Chicken is inedible. Dry, hard, tasteless and impossible to rip apart. My dad describes it best: ""you couldn't even hit it with a hammer, and if you threw it at a dog, the dog would die."" Seems like it was microwaved over and over again until the chef decided to serve it to someone. -Steak is limp and cold. Once again, it was impossible to cut and super chewy. We ordered medium rare and it came out rare and red. Didn't look appetizing at all. Honestly, how hard can it be to make a good piece of steak? Really shows just how subpar the chef is. -Salmon: average but nothing special, disappointing because this was the only main seafood dish we tried in a seafood restaurant. Shouldn't the seafood at least be decent? -Shrimp pasta: regular ole pasta in white cream sauce, not tasty but not bad-just ok. To top it off, after the appetizers came out, it must have been at least 45 minutes until the entrees came out. And we were only one of three parties there. What was the kitchen doing the whole time? The food wasn't even fresh! After the entrees, we had no energy to try the desserts. They served us carrot cake, cheesecake, chocolate cake, bread pudding, and they all tasted like regular American desserts. Nothing special again (sorry, this comment seems like something I've repeated too many times in this review) Sangria: ugly display with mushy fruit Aside from the food, the restaurant advertises itself as a fine dining environment with dimmed lights. But, the way the servers pass out silverware (reaches across table rather than setting down the utensils behind each person) signifies a lack of experience in ""fine dining"". There is a friendly bar where people seemed to be having fun. But I'll definitely not be back-it was the first meal I had on my trip to Detroit and the Detroit Seafood Market has ruined my expectations for the food in this city."
1 star rating,"Reserved a booth for a business meeting. Get there and no booth available. Get stuck sitting directly next to the person I'm meeting with in a small awkward table. Paella had 4 shrimp and 4 muscles. All pretty much rice! Disappointing!! Dinner came with no salad. Didn't get bread until our meal came out. Dessert peach cobbler was so hot couldn't even eat it all the ice cream melted right away and there was no cobbler. The only good part of the experience was the waiter. He went above a beyond to get us moved to a booth as soon as one opened up and was very nice and accommodating.  In closing,Food is overpriced for what you are getting and not fulfiling. You pay for parking $10, take the drive from the burbs, I would have expected much more seafood and soup or salad instead of fillers like bread and rice.  Flavors were on point. Waiter was good. Restaurant was clean in the dining area. Bathrooms needed attention. After spending $125,  I could have ate way better food less than a mile from my house. We would not go back again. Oh and lastly, some African Americans were chasing us down as we were walking to our cars asking if we wanted to party and by some dope. Holds his phone up in the air and says it's not a gun, it's a phone (eye roll). Garbage hanging around the restaurant as well. People do not want to go to dinner and deal with being chased down and offered drugs."
2 star rating,"Came here for their Sunday Brunch. Therefore, this review might be a little limited compared to their usual fare.They serve a great selection for their Sunday Brunch. The standard omelette, waffle and prime rib station is present. They have a good selection of breakfast usual a such as bacon, egg, sausages and potatoes. Expect fried chicken wings, corn bread, collards, grits, ribs, Mac and cheese and more. As for seafood, they have some broiled fish and another white fish with some breading. Their dessert station is limited to slices of cheesecake, brownies and lemon bars. I think they can improve by hiring a pastry chef. There was a jazz saxophonist playing. With this, the ambiance was just alive and happy. Plus the fact the buffet includes 2 mimosas per person - I was probably happier than my usual state."
4 star rating,If there was an option for NO stars I would select it. I'm here for Sunday brunch on Father's Day and I'm very disappointed. Where do I begin....The menu is limited to greasy fried food. None of the items were available all at the same time. They continue to run out of food. Only one person working the Omlette/waffle station. The work area was nasty. The server had a funky attitude and was very slow. This is an awful brunch. DO NOT waste your money. I will NEVER come here again.Two more things.....our table was only set for 2 and we had a party of 5. Finally dirty plates were left on our table. I had to ask to have them removed. Please avoid this dump.
1 star rating,"Came here with a group of friends on a busy Friday evening. This was my first time in the place and it wasn't too bad. It was a tad dark inside, but they had a great jazz band playing in the background. Apparently there was a surprise party being held, because once the guest walked in, it was REALLY loud for about 30 minutes. Our server was friendly but new. We asked about the drinks but she wasn't too sure what alcohol was what or if they served it. That's okay though, all of that comes with more time of serving in the restaurant. As an appetizer, we ordered the lobster mac 'n cheese. The Mac 'n Cheese was pretty good, but where was the lobster? There was a serving portion for two people in the ramekin. I got one piece of lobster, and it wasn't even that big. For our entrees, I ordered the stuffed salmon, my friend ordered the Steak Delmonico. For drinks, I had the park and stormy, he had the mojito. Our other friends also ordered the steak, and the seafood alfredo. They had a glass of sauvignon. We waited quite a bit for the food and the drinks. As a matter of fact, the drinks came out AFTER the food and they weren't as good as I hoped they would be. For dessert we tried the bread pudding, which was the best part of the meal. The second glass of wine was poured inconsistently with the first as my friend pointed out, when questioned, our server said they changed out bartenders, but it was a big difference in how much was poured the first glass to the second. Our total bill came out to about $150 for two people. The steak was delicious but I wasn't impressed with the salmon. The bland and scant thinly sliced vegetables underneath were a disappointment also. Overall, I'm not sure I'd come back for the price. Our friends had a Groupon so their bill was about half of ours...maybe then I'd come back."
3 star rating,"I am going from a 1 star to a 5 star.I called the management a few months ago complaining about our rude waitress and incompetent manager on duty that night. The food was cold and beyond late.I was asked by manager Maurice to come back and give it another try on the house, So I accepted. It was night and day! Service was exceptional thanks to a great server by the name of Bennie, food was tasty(surf and turf) and warm and the atmosphere was alive!I will definitely be coming back and will spread the word that this establishment is worth it!"
5 star rating,"I went there recently with friends who had reservations. 10 min later the waitress who seemed overwhelmed since she had 2 larger tables to attend to finally asked if we wanted drinks. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and that's because I had to seek her out and remind her. After 45 min of waiting for our apps, they came out with our entrees!!The oysters were not shucked and my salmon was cold. My friends ordered the stuffed flounders and one entree was dry and the other was soggy and cold. The waitress was inattentive and never asked how we were doing and never brought out dishes or helped remove plates. I had to remind her that we expect better service and only response was I understand and immediately walked away. The waitress who had disappeared upset us so much that I finally went to seek out the manager who said he'd be right with us. He never visited us to hear our concerns! I ate the dinner only because I was famished and feared it would take another 45 min to be delivered. I can feel the mood in the restaurant and it was anxious and upset. I heard other patrons arguing with wait staff regarding their food being delivered late too.The only plus in this pathetic establishment was the one man jazz band. I will not return nor will I ever recommend."
1 star rating,"This place was a disappointment. I had high hopes. The decor was beautiful and quite charming I loved the fact the booths had curtains. Our host was a bit dry! For a lack of a better word. So dry that we had to ask her what was wrong. It felt like we were a bother and she didnt want us there! She stated that she was short staffed. She never came back to check on us just handed us our food.As for the food it was ok. Nothing to write home about. We went in about 4pm so we were only offered the lunch menu which came without bread. Before leaving we decided to go to the rest room. The other waitress looked from across the room and ask ""Did you pay for your check""? ""Oh ok just checking"" Dispite the fact we all had to-go boxes wrapped up in their unattractive ""farmer Jack"" bags.  She wasn't our waitress at all! I was offended!. She assumed we were going to run off without paying! But why? I don't think we looked liked scavengers! But I guess she sure did!The bathroom is HORRIBLE. The sinks are nasty looking and it is in need of repair. I wouldn't expect a bathroom from a beautifully modern establishment to look like that! I will post pics as proof. I hate to see what the kitchen looks like! Service was poor and due to the fact they assumed we were criminals about to run off on our bill I was turned off. Excuse me ma'am I'm a professional and more than likely I make way more money than you do!  Don't assume because we are 3 young African Americans that we are automatically thieves! The crazy thing about it is the entire staff was black! I really want to call back and speak with the manager but im afraid the manager is probably the lady that served us. I will not be returning and I will be sure to let all my friends and family know do not patronize them. Detroit Seafood you offended me and my sisters and thats not ok!"
1 star rating,"I must be frank that I was there during the Tiger's day opening, but had a reservation at 6:15 for 5 people. We waited and waited and waited for our salads but were entertained by the rude ""happy hour"" patrons who were yelling across the dinning room.The food was very good but I will never go back again due to the unruly crowd.They have to figure out if they want a bar or a nice restaurant."
2.5 star rating,"I came on the night of Tuesday, January 17,2017. There was no one in the dining area. I arrived at 9pm. Upon my arrival I told the bartender I had a reservation with OpenTable. She nodded her head and proceeded to the back to get her guest food. She didn't bring anyone out or ask me to take a seat. I waiting 10 minutes to be seated. The dining area was completely empty. There was 3 parties sitting at the bar. I heard staff laughing in the back of the kitchen. I decided to seat myself. Then I was approached by the waitress who stated they were going to close the kitchen at 9:10pm. I shared I had an open table reservation.  The manager finally comes to my table and asked if I was seated. I informed her I sat myself since I waited for 10 minutes to be serviced. Upon my entry there was a bartender who saw me walk in. She did not inform me they were closed. Instead she walked to the back to get food and left me waiting.The manager informed me they closed at 9pm. I informed the manager that all of their social media platforms stated they closed at 10pm. Both on yelp, Open Table, & Google. The manager did not come back to apologize for the inconvenience.I was greeted again by Cali, server. She was accommodating despite the manager's lack of concern. I decided to place an order for the Lobster Mac &Cheese and the Fried Twin Lobster Tails. After 5 minutes, Cali came back and stated they cut off the fryers and were not willing to turn them back on. I decided that since I was here I would settle to just get the Mac& Cheese and take the rest of my business elsewhere. My Mac & Cheese arrive and the lobster was cold inside. After confessing to the server I was going to rank them on Yelp, the cook them agreed to cook my original order. The fries Lobster tails were decent but they substituted my mashed potatoes with rice without asking me. Let's fast forward to me paying for the check. I asked the manager on duty to get my check. She stated she would get my waitress. It was over 20 minutes and no one brought my check. I could have literally walked out. I then got the attention on the manager and asked if my food was free. She asked me why???... Well although there is an entire list of why it should be I saved my breath. Instead I shared that no one had brought my check yet. 5 minutes later my waitress returned with my check and compensated my poor service by taking off of the Mac & cheese. Absolutely terrible!!!This is a terrible experience!!! I would not waste my time going to this restaurant. Trust me...DO NOT GO. I reached out several times to get in contact with the owner. They always said he wasn't there. I left my business card with the manager on duty as well as the server Cali. I have yet to receive a call from the manager. I did look him up online, Kenny Akinwale. If this is the way he does business stay far away!!!!!"
1 star rating,"Too bad I cannot give this ZERO stars! This was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in years.  I should have trusted my instinct to go elsewhere after I walked in and the hostess was rude about our reservation saying it would be 15 minutes and then proceeded to sit walk in parties ahead of us.  The manager approached us and didn't seem to care.  STRIKE 1Our waiter was a real nice guy except he must have been a magician since he seemed to disappear whenever we needed anything....water, bread (asked 3 times for it), bill, etc...Onto the food, my wife's meal came out wrong and she sent it back immediately.  It came back 5 minutes later still wrong but my wife wasn't going to try again.  After we sent her food back, I cut into my salmon to find it was uncooked.  Took 10 minutes to find the waiter and sent it back.  Fast forward 25 minutes and the food finally came back out.  My wife had finished 15 minutes prior.  STRIKE 2The waiter apologized and said he wouldn't charge me for my meal.  A little while later, the manager came up and I explained our dining experience.  He said he would comp the bill, which would have redeemed this experience.   We finally get our bill and it only had my salmon dish removed.  Since I didn't want to spend another 2 hours waiting, I gave him my credit card.  That's when I see the manager run over to the waiter.  I thought he was telling him to comp the meal.  Guess he had a change of heart because they ran my credit card and brought it back.  STRIKE 3.This restaurant is in desperate need of new management and a better chef.  Food was mediocre at best."
1 star rating,"Expect upscale prices, but poor food quality, average atmosphere, and service that is friendly, but slow.Normally, after an experience like ours, I'd offer the business a chance to make things right, but, as you'll see later, there simply was not enough time.  Hopefully, this review will be helpful, not only to the readers on Yelp, but to the restaurant owners as well.What we ordered:-Jambalaya: The soup was OK, but was served with a scoop of cold, undercooked rice on top.  After picking out the meat, the rest of the soup and hard rice sat on the side.-Lobster Mac & Cheese: A few good-sized chunks of lobster is the one redeeming quality of this item.  The dish lacked any real flavor or ""cheesiness"".  Underneath the cheese and crackers baked on top, it was basically plain noodles with a few chunks of lobster.-Calamari: Their ""top seller"" according to our server. The breading and sauce was quite good, but know that they use cuts of more mature squids -- which are larger and seemed tougher in consistency than the more common variety which are small and tender.-Crab Cake: Served with the same sauce as the calamari, the flavor was OK, but our dish was undercooked and the ""cake"" portion in the middle was soggy.The service:Our server was friendly and enthusiastic -- which was a great start.  We informed him that we had a show to catch in about an hour so we would be ordering off the appetizer menu for quickness. He understood.  After taking our initial order, we saw him only once again (delivering our drink order), before we had only 10 minutes to get to the theater. We had no other choice but to literally get up, walk around and find another employee to track him down so we could cash out and not miss our show.  All of the food was dropped off by other servers, at separate times, in a manner more consistent with a Denny's diner than a high-end restaurant.Misc:There was a large piece of foil from the bottle at the bottom of my wine glass."
1 star rating,"Tried the house salad and the lobster trio. The salad was fresh and as requested, topped with an addiquite mound of blue cheese. While wishing I had some good bread to go with it, my lobster trio arrived. Three medium tails at top rice pilaf and surrounded with lemon wedges. The tails were cooked perfect with a hint of herbs and even better after a dunk in the drawn butter. The rice however was pretty bland and over cooked. Service was good but they were in no hurry. Moderately priced with a great atmosphere will help me go back again to try some of their other offerings. All you can eat crab legs on Wednesday...who's with me?"
3 star rating,"I use to visit here a lot when they first opened but stopped because the staff changed and it was not good service.  However, I have given them another try and they are consistent with the food. I love the stuffed salmon.  I have been here several times and I enjoy the food and drinks. The staff has gotten better and they even have live entertainment on some nights. I am going to try visiting on a Wednesday for there crab leg special."
4 star rating,Suckers are closed finally!Karma is something else!Food was terrible only thing they had going good was the bar and they messed that up!
1 star rating,This food was so good. My husband cleaned his plate. Nice place to go downtown. Has live entertainment I was there on Wednesday. I love the booths with the privacy curtains. The booths are very spacious. Look on Groupon to get that great deal!!!
5 star rating,The food was great our server was great with helping with what to pick to eat the decor is nice this is a great place for a nice romantic date or nice place to celebrate a birthday dinner prices were reasonable as well the only thing was it did take our server a while to get us out check but besides that the experience was excellent will be back again for sure
4 star rating,"Let me start by saying that I am typically a very patient and passive customer. Having worked in the restaurant industry before, I understand the pressure and customer expectations. I generally do not complain, but I was extremely disappointed. There was a miscommunication with the staff that somehow left my wife and I without food for literally fifty minutes. The worst part was that, we were literally the ONLY customers in the restaurant! Service:-The waitress we ordered from apparently didn't put in our order and then she left as there was a shift change.-The new waitress gave attitude when I finally asked her about the food. (Which was around the 40 minute mark.) -I was then told, it takes a long time to boil crab legs. Really??? Food:-Ordered the crab spinach dip, 3lb crab legs, and crab cakes-The spinach dip came out cold and the crab meat was definitely an after thought as it was randomly thrown on top of the dip. One would have assumed the crab meat would have been incorporated INTO the dip and not ON the dip.-The crab legs were mediocre. It's boiled crab legs, so not much to review.-The crab cake was cold. No surprise as I am sure it has been sitting on the counter for sometime. Flavor was very bland. I will conclude my review with the fact that I talked with the manager and he was sympathetic to my concerns. He was dumbfounded as well, when I told him how long it took for the food to come out. He apologized and took 10% off our tab. I am all for supporting local establishments, but do not expect business if this is the service you give. This will be the first and last time I visit."
1 star rating,Nachos were as delicious as they were greasy. And as you can see...there's a whole helluvalotta grease.
2.5 star rating,Delicious great service very friendly from the door to the kitchen and the patrons as well. Everyone around was so happy and commenting on how well their food was tasting! This was actually our 2nd time dinning here and the 1st is what brought us back! I highly recommend this establishment.
5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite places to hangout when I am in Detroit and I want to have a good meal or have a few drinks. I mainly go to their happy hour, it is one that I consider the best in the Downtown Detroit area. The drinks are always full glass not half or thirds and the bar staff is cute, lol mostly women who make sure that my glass is always full. I also love the fact that most days the drinks (if you sit at the bar) are half off. I usually order whiskey or gin. The drinks are strong enough to get you buzzed from just one drink but I usually order a few :) Sometimes, I order some appetizers which are good as well. The vibe is very modern hipster in the bar area and very,modern romantic in the dining area."
5 star rating,Disappointing experience. Service confused and receipts too complicated. I just received a very professional answer from the owner that proves willingness to improve and good customer attitude. I should also mention that we were a group of 40 people and thus does not make things easy. The restaurant deserves an additional chance.
2 star rating,"Tried hard my friends. I was hungry, my wife is easily pleased and I had plenty of cash.  Best advice- don't do it. Worst dinner and drinks in a very long time. Not the staffs fault but kitchen must be a hot damn mess. Manager was nice and took the warm, unshucked oysters off my bill... ugh"
1 star rating,I use to really like this place a few years ago.. just relocated back and the food was a big disappointment and cold for the middle of the day with no crowd.. The clam chowder was good the rest of my meal and my dates meal very mediocre if that.  crab and artichoke dip barely anything but cheese not good.. crab cake decent but very artificial now.. stuffed salmon meh.. lobster mash not good.. stuffed shrimp even worse.. quality just isn't the same.
2 star rating,"It's our first time here. First impressions are important. I picked up my napkin and there was a black, curly hair on it.  Placed our order. The cup of gumbo was not good. Not a fan of okra though. Main entree was the Southern Fried Seafood Platter which has catfish, shrimp and scallops and fries. Not a very daring dish but dangerously delicious. One entree of Hot & Crunchy Grouper was spicy and good. It was encrusted with corn flakes and a red-pepper sauce, along side of rice and vegetables. I substituted the broccoli. The portions were large and the temps were hot. The flavors were on point. Salah was our waiter. Very good service. The entertainment was calming and the ambiance was chill."
4 star rating,"So I believe I had extremely high expectations for this place because the last time we came all I could talk about was the lobster being SO good. We brought my mom here for her last night out in Detroit. She is here on vacation and we really wanted her to have an experience she wouldn't forget. Hostess sat us right away. A gentleman waking around brought us waters. It did take a while for the waitress to come take drink orders. (I don't recall her name as she didn't introduce herself a really big pet peeve of mine). We ordered the calamari as an appetizer. Appetizer: personally for me it was over cooked. My mom enjoyed the dipping sauce. Entrees: Fried twin lobster tails with garlic mashed and seasonal veggies side of asparagus. First let me say the last time I ordered this it was an easy 5 star rating. Now, tonight my lobster was obviously over cooked I could tell right away from the amount of batter that was on the lobster tails I'm sure they had to cook it longer than normal.  The mashed potatoes tasted almost burnt like when you leave the pot on too long and you have burnt mashed potatoes at the bottom of the pot. Seasonal veggies were cooked ok I guess but I cannot give an honest review on them because I got one broccoli floret and 2 carrot slices with a few slivers of red and green bell pepper. (Sideways face not impressed)Kenny's Personal favorite (chicken, beef tips, shrimp, catfish in a spinach mushroom type of rice. Now this is supposed to be a bit of everything but it was over powered by heat instead of heat filled flavor.  Won't be recommend this one.Overall just ok this time. I would go back if I got a groupon."
2 star rating,"I took Ken for a repeat trip to DSM to use up our rapidly expiring Groupon for Sunday Brunch buffet.Highlights were the cheese blintzes with berry sauce, fried catfish with pretty tasty tartar sauce, mac & cheese (plain, not lobster), fluffy, fresh scrambled eggs, and gravy from the biscuits and gravy.Low points were soggy Belgian waffles (made right in front of us, so should have been crispy), the complete lack of filler items at the made-to-order omelet station, the hard-as-a-rock biscuits and turkey sausage patties.Super low points were no Eggs Benedict on the buffet at all (even though it was an item shown on the online menu), and the fact that they we had to pay for our coffee and soda, both of which were shown to be included on the online menu.  Coffee cost $3.45!!!  Plain, black coffee.  On top of the already $25 per person price tag.We arrived at 12:15pm.  The bruch started at noon.  There is no excuse for dried out food on a just opened 'fabulous' buffet table.  There is also no excuse for a waitress shrugging her shoulders and saying 'I don't know why the website says that' when questioned about our drinks not being included."
2 star rating,"Detroit Restaurant Week review...Mom and I dined here after a day at the DIA.  The DIA closes at 4pm on Thursdays, so that is when we arrived.  So, it was us, the staff, and a table of old ladies until at least 5pm.  No valet or private parking, but there is a manned lot across the street for $5 or under.  Spacious interior with large windows and relaxing decor.  Staff was laid back and friendly.They offered a $16 wine/cordial pairing for the three-course DRW menu, and I must admit I was pleased with the healthy pours and the quality of the wine I received (our waitress also manned the bar at this ungodly hour, so she treated me to a bright, citrus-y Sauvignon Blanc not on the menu to accompany my entree).Our first course was the Maryland Lump Crab Cake and bacon-wrapped Gulf Shrimp.  My tasty-but-not-so-lumpy crabcake came with a sweet-spicy chili drizzle.  Mom's shrimp were nice sized, topped with cherry BBQ sauce.  The bacon was perfectly cooked.  3.5 and 4.0Our second course was the Atlantic Salmon Florentine and Seafood Fettuccine.  This was a disappointing course for both of us (but the entree portion of their DRW menu is weak).  My salmon was dry, topped with what looked like spinach dip, and accompanied by white rice.  Meh.  Mom's seafood was one tiny scallop, a couple of small clams, two mussels and about ten hunks of dry salmon.  There was supposed to be shrimp too, but not in Mom's bowl. 2.5 and 2.5Dessert was NY cheesecake and chocolate lava cake.  Large desserts.  The cheesecake was dense and moist.  Mom's lava cake flowed, but it was chocolate overload.  Our cordials were served on the rocks, in fair-sized tumblers.  3.0 and 3.0"
3 star rating,"I wanted to like this place. That was not possible unfortunately. The fish was blend as it lacked salt and it was overcooked. It was not served with any sauce, even though it said so on the menu. The staff members were discussing personal matters among themselves very loudly, which gave a very unprofessional impression."
2 star rating,"GROSS! Way overpriced for below average food. The service was however, impressive considering the quality of food served here. Our waitress was great, it's the food that was a let down. A red flag should've been the fact that this place had only ONE other table when we arrived in the evening plus the average of 3* stars on here which I think is generous. To start: Lobster Mac and cheese: overrated. Bland. Small portion for one not two like the menu indicates Ceasar salad: components were fresh however dressing was very watery. Croutons were okay. Seafood paella: large portion! Rice was soaked with oil and dish was salty. My friend ordered the king crab legs and said the size was rather small. AVOID this place. Back to Joe Maur I go! Won't be coming back here again. Wish I could get back the $10 I paid for parking across the street.."
2.5 star rating,"If you aren't scared Away by the restroom (as I should have been) The cold unimpressive food that isn't accompanied by Veggies Will definitely do the job. If you order wine, the staff isn't knowledgeable about wine and won't bother asking nor guiding you in any direction even about prices. Steer clear.The ambiance is that of jazz to the left, annoying neighbors blasting trap Music with nothing but bass to the right.  Impossible to hold a conversation. We won't return."
1 star rating,"First time dining here dang sure ain't gonna be my last time. The lobster mac and cheese was excellent and everything that I dreamed that it would be. Awesome cocktails too. The service was a little slow but I didn't mind my wife sipped our drinks,  listened to the jazz player and munched on our lump crab appetizers."
5 star rating,"We visited on 1-2-16The atmosphere is pretty nice - more like a old fashioned piano bar feeling. There were very few people, especially for a Saturday night. The wait staff was okay, but not very friendly. Service is very, very slow. We were in no hurry, so this wasn't a problem for us.Apparently they are known for their fried twin lobster tails - never heard of such a thing, but I ordered that. It was pricey, but very good and tender, although quite greasy. The dessert we shared was a raspberry mocha cheese cake that was truly excellent!Entrees were over priced I think for what they were. All in all a fairly nice place, would maybe visit again, but mostly for the dessert."
3 star rating,"Visited for restaurant week and was excited to be trying a new place. The staff was attentive and courteous but the food was lackluster.  Appetizer of shrimp and bruschetta. The shrimp was over cooked and rubbery. The bruschetta was assembled on a biscuit that was reminiscent of a shortcake, sweet and sense. Not a good combination at all. I had the sirloin and it was extremely disappointing. Ordered it medium rare and it was solid grey throughout. The manager did ask if I wanted a new one fired, but it was so thin I assumed, and maybe wrongly so, that there would be no way to make it anything but well done. The cut itself was also poor quality. Two small portions separated by a large section of fat, etcetera. The drinks were good but pricey.  The decor was classy, and again I stress that the staff was outstanding. The meal itself was not good. Maybe I caught them on a bad day with the volume they were experiencing due to restaurant week??"
2 star rating,"I LOVE seafood so I was so excited to dine here BUT my excitement was quickly extinguished when I called to make reservations. I called today (Thursday) at around 2pm. The first time I called, the phone rang and rang. No one answered. I called back about 5 minutes later and while someone answered this time, the person mumbled and spoke rapidly. ""Hold please"" was the only phrase I was able to understand. I waited but I was so confused by how the phone was answered, I double checked the number to make sure I had called the right place.When the young man returned to the call, I explained that I was interested in hosting a birthday dinner with a party of 20 the following Saturday. Either lunch or dinner would work. I just wanted a reservation during the least busiest time. He told me that reservations were pretty light during lunch and dinner and asked what time I would be interested in. I said 3pm would work best and I was in the process of asking another question when he cut me off.He said (in a not so welcoming tone): ""Well, first off, for a party that large I would need a $200 deposit and there will be no separate checks. The $200 would be applied to your final bill. Are you still interested in making a reservation?""I told him I was still interested but I needed to speak with my husband first. A sensible request, I thought, but he seemed to take offense to that and rudely said ""Well, call back then."" Okay, I thought.I didn't recall him introducing himself so I asked for his name. He mumbled ""Julius"" and when I asked him to spell it because I didn't want to mispronounce his name, he rambled off the spelling, told me to have a good day and quickly hung up the phone. I have never had such a terrible experience when simply trying to reserve a table!If Julius' intention was to deter me from making a reservation, it worked. I have no problem paying a deposit and I am certain my friends and family wouldn't mind bringing cash so I'm not offended by their policy for large parties. What offends me is the lack of patience and the impoliteness the representative displayed when taking a simple reservation. A RESERVATION!  If his impatience and insolence is any indication of their service and the quality of their food then I want no part of it. Simply unprofessional."
1 star rating,After trying to order one (expensive) bottle of wine.... They said they were out. Moved onto the second requested bottle of wine. Out of that too. I just didn't understand how after 2 tries we couldn't get a bottle that was in the higher price end. 30 minutes later we decided to leave. Piano player was great so I'd recommend beers or mixed drinks at the bar.
2 star rating,"This was by far the worst dining experience we have had in a long time. From the waiter to the food, just plain awful. The minute we walked into the door, after making reservations a few days before, we waited 15 minutes to be seated. By the time we were seated, our waiter had an attitude. We didn't know anything about the restaurant, it was our first visit. We asked him what their most popular drink is, and he was annoyed about giving us details. We ordered a Bellini, which was supposed to taste like peach and champagne; but instead tasted like robitussin, had strawberries floating in it and had no champagne (or if there was champagne then it was flat and old). The drink made no sense! Appetizers were decent, the lobster Mac and cheese was not a big deal in my opinion, but their oysters were great! I ordered the steamed king crab legs, which came out cold and a side of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. The waiter argued with me after I sent back the spinach telling him that I asked for creamed spinach, not steamed spinach. After a minute long argument, he walked away rolling his eyes. He came back 10 minutes later telling me that the creamed spinach would be out, after I had already finished my meal. I told him to cancel it and he argued that they were on their way, and I once again told him to cancel it. I didn't ask him to order it again, he walked away in the middle of my sentence. The worst part is that they charged us extra to have spinach as a part of my meal, and after all the hassle, we were still charged extra for the spinach even though I did not eat it. To avoid any further arguments, we took whatever was extra on our bill out of his tip."
1 star rating,"This was a disaster from the minute we walked in. The hostess had her eyes glued so hard to get iPhone, she barely had time to look up and say hello. We waited over 10 minutes to be seated even though we had made reservations several days prior and the restaurant was half full. Our sever came to our table and the disaster became progressively worse. If you done here, avoid having Bennie E as your server, just a recommendation.We relieved service you would expect from a local Coney Island establishment, not one who serves lobster and steak and prides itself as upscale. The food was ok, the atmosphere was alright but the terrible service from start to end made this a very unpleasant experience. When you have very little time to dine out, you expect to enjoy yourself when you do and this unfortunately was anything but enjoyable."
1 star rating,"The seafood market has proven from my multiple experience they are better for Brunch than dinner. I feel the brunch is well priced for the selection you are offered as well the option for 2 mimosas with your meal. They have a very southern selection of food during games brunch including greens, Mac and cheese fries chicken as well as several options for fish both fried and baked. During brunch you are also Serenaded  by a live performer who sings and plays jazz music. Dinner however, is very over priced for the quality of food. I spent over $100 in one sitting and didn't not have anything I would want again. My boyfriend and I had different entrees and they both proven to be under-seasoned and mediocre. I ordered crab legs and they were terribly bland.  The drinks I order were also not good. In my opinion they need to rethink the menu and get some fresh new ideas."
3 star rating,"This is the first restaurant that I have gone to in quite a while in which I can say I enjoyed the entire experience. From the ambiance, to the staff, and ultimately the food was all amazing.We had a groupon, which limited us to a smaller menu. Nevertheless, the food was amazing! I can't rave enough.Appetizer:scallops provencal: topped with a butter sauce with tomatoes, and made to perfection. Highly recommendedEntrees:Chilean sea bass topped with crab with asparagus and jasmine rice. The Chilean sea bass was barbequed and it was simply amazing. The grilled flavor came out in the perfect amount, the white butter sauce it was topped with was simply delicious and balanced very well with the dish. The asparagus was good, and the jasmine rice was average, but honestly the sea bass made it all.Stuffed lobster with mixed vegetables and red skin potatoes. This is another dish that could easily be overdone or bland and it was anything but! it came as an entire lobster split in half and done to perfection! the mixed vegetables were deliciously sautéed with a hint of salt. The red skin potatoes were just red skin potatoes. dessert:Cheesecake with berry topping and whip cream. It was definitely not a frozen dessert. Everything on the plate complemented each other and was not heavy at all.chocolate mousse with berry topping, chocolate sauce, and whip cream: I love chocolate and this was amazing. It was a layer of chocolate, with mousse, on top of chocolate cake layer. When  you bit into it you tasted different textures and I can't more about it as I will crave it!Overall experience was exceptional. I am a bit of a restaurant snob, and must say i'm super excited I got to try this restaurant. It is a gem!!Also, Mayor Bing walked past my table...with a man in a bright orange, knee length mink coat...that was pretty entertaining! speaking of entertainment I noticed there was a singer/guitar player. this would be a great place for a date or special occasion!"
2.5 star rating,"Got a Groupon for $58 so I could try their Resturant.1 appetizer, 2 entres, 2 desserts Could not order off of the regular menu. Instead given a half sheet of paper with two selections per entre, appetizer, and dessert. None of which were on the regular menu???How could I truly try their food if it wasn't on the menu???Server had us waiting whilst she chatted it up in the front of the house.Ordered starter off the menu. Fried Calamari which came with four oil soaked French fries ???Mashed potatoes were dry.  No seasoning My dinner salmon on rice with vegetables on top swimming in vege juice???Sad I will never go back and wouldn't ever recommend any of my friends or family to try this restaurant"
1 star rating,"So had been hearing about this spot for some time. I wasn't  disappointed. I ordered the DSM. It was amazing.our waiter was cool, attentive. I had a drink that was great . The name can't remember but it was shocking. It was the perfect meal for an really great date"
5 star rating,"Had dinner on New Year's Eve... Went in with a decent expectation which was crushed instantaneously. The service was HORRIBLE! Long periods of time would pass without a waiter in sight. Some of the staff were rude. We had to wait forever and ask for everything. The waiters didn't even come around to refill our water. We had to request utensils. The food was pricey and of average quality at best. One waiter for maybe 10 tables, definitely understaffed on a day like New Year's Eve. Never going back again"
2 star rating,Stopped in here before the Yankees v Tigers game for their all you can eat crab legs.The all you cat eat crab legs came with a small bowl of soup. I had the clam chowder and my other half had the seafood gumbo. Both were pretty weak.The all you can eat crab legs were better. We both stopped at three plates. We had a game to go to.
3 star rating,Another amazing seafood restaurant in the heart of downtown Detroit! If you're looking for delicious food with reasonable prices this is the place. Detroit Seafood Market has some of the best happy hour specials Monday through Friday and live music on occasion. My go to meal is the lobster macaroni and cheese with catfish fingers or crab cakes.
4 star rating,Took my granddaughter for her birthday and before seeing Wicked. Plenty of options on the menu and large portions - could have shared. It was early so not very crowded and they have outdoor seating (but smokers - no thanks). I had pasta w/a cream sauce and chicken and she had Fish and Chips - both were delicious. The waiter knew it was her birthday so he brought a slice of cake. Great experience. Only downside was when I logged in a coupon for 50% off an app and drink popped up but then I couldn't find it when it came time to pay the bill. The coupon was from Yelp
4 star rating,The service was good. The dinner was not very good. I had ordered the Perch dinner and it was loaded with bones.The worst part of my experience involved a table near us where the guest were very loud and rude. They used their cell phone and shouting out profanities without regard for those around them. Our waitress apologized. It would have been nice to have someone from management get involved.
2 star rating,"Let me start by saying the service here is good. Never had an issue with that. I like the fact that they have a nice variety of food on the menu. Even though I typically order the same thing every time. You can't really go wrong with oysters and seared tuna right? I've also ordered the tuna steak dinner and I HATED IT!! Cooking a tuna steak to me well done is an abomination!! Lol. They did however offer to replace it with something else but being the food snob I am I declined. Which is probably why I no longer order entrees from there.On the bright side the happy hour is awesome!!! The drinks are really good! My favorite is the Bellini! The appetizers are also very good. Besides the seared tuna and oysters the three tier tower was really good.  Over all this place is pretty cool. The atmosphere is really nice, the staff is friendly, and the drinks are good. HOWEVER, they have all you can eat snow crab legs on Wednesday for $30. Steal right?? Wrong. I love snow crab legs but they freaking suck!!! They lack flavor!! I was so disappointed with them!! Juicy yes! Flavor ZERO!! I'm pretty sure they boil them which sucks the life out of them. They should give you the option to have them steamed. Besides that I'll be back :-)"
3 star rating,Came here for a dinner party. The manager told us we were the first to arrive. Our party was around in the first booth. We sit down and they served us cold tasteless bread with saltless butter. We ordered appetizers that took an hour to come out. The Thai chicken app had over spiced grainy breading the slaw was also too spicy. The kids menu had chicken fingers we ordered for our child... they were clearly fried in fish batter. The chicken dinner entree was over-cooked and extremely dry. The mushroom sauce tasted like bloody water. Blech! They should not be allowed to stay open. The service was poor : the server inattentive and delinquent. Terrible experience.
1 star rating,This was my first and last time ever eating at Detroit Seafood Market.   We definitely should have listened to the reviews and avoided this place at all costs.  We had to ask for bread and silverware.  Our food took a very very long time to come.  I ordered the stuffed rainbow trout which looked good but I noticed had a funny smell.  Against my better judgment I decided to at least taste it.  The stuffing was cold and pungent.  I immediately began to gag and could not finish eating.  I am not a person to complain but I could not go on eating that food.  There were no apologies given for the poor service.  Even the manager didn't offer an apology.  It is one of the worse restaurant experiences I've ever had.  If you are considering going to this place...JUST DON'T DO IT!!!
2.5 star rating,"A horrible experience today.  Came for brunch and they were out of everything. Said they were currently cooking more food. 35 minutes later, still no food. Once the food game came, everything was different. Greasy and just horrible. Manager had a horrible attitude and thought I should be more accepting because they never know what the warehouse is gonna send!!!! You have got to be kidding me!!!!! Then expected gratitude for delivering the food to the table which is not policy during brunch. Use to great. I will never return or recommend. I should have known something by the parking being cut in half. Save your time and money."
1 star rating,I came at a pretty chill time so the service was great and the food came quickly. Food was good and a thankful departure from hotel food. Drinks were mixed well and reasonably priced for the food price point.
5 star rating,"Hubby and I were excited to try this place out for the first time, their food selection/menu sounded good. Unfortunately it was a disappointment. When we got there the ambiance was intimate and cozy so that was nice. But that ended there: for appetizers i ordered the boom boom shrimp, and it was too salty, and the thai chicken was okay. For our entrees hubby got the rib eye steak and i had the lamb chops. Both entrees lacked flavor and seasoning especially my lamb chops, it was bland, I had to put salt and pepper (they used too much salt in the shrimp and ran out, I guess). The lava cake for dessert needed vanilla ice cream which our waitress said they didn't have that night. For the price of their food we expected to have an amazing dinner. But definitely it was not the case. Food wasn't worth it for the price. So we won't be coming back. And this is huge coming from me, since i love food and am easy to please when it comes to eating."
2 star rating,"A group of 8 of us came here for DRW and I don't think any of us will be back.  Everything seemed so unorganized you would have thought either they have never participated in DRW before or that their entire staff was new.  We had reservations for 6PM and were told when we got there they were getting our table ready and to wait in the lounge.  After inquiring about our table twice, we finally got seated 40 minutes later.  Our waiter seemed to not be familiar with what we were ordering from the DRW menu and seemed very overworked.  Everyone ordered drinks along with the meal and some people never got them even after asking about them multiple times.The food was hit or miss.  I ordered the goat cheese crustini and it was pathetic.  It came with maybe 1 tablespoon of goat cheese.  I was told the lobster bisque was decent and the Thai chicken was really good.  No one really said anything either way about their meal, but I ordered the Delmonico steak and it was the worst steak I have ever ordered.  Two of us asked for medium, when the server brought it out, he said it was medium rare, but it was actually well done and a thin, fatty, nasty piece of meat.  It was not marbled, it was fully of fat and gristle.  Two of us ordered the drink pairing with the meal and we had to ask three times to get our wine.  The desserts of molten cake and cheesecake were good, but once again, we had to wait about 01 minutes after dessert came to get our coffee drink pairing.Cashing out even took about 30 minutes.  Three other employees came over to see if we needed anything.  I think they were trying to usher us out since we were sitting there obviously done, but not leaving, but we were waiting for the check.  The whole ordeal took 3 hours and unfortunately it was not due to us overstaying our welcome; we could not wait to get out of there.I was told this is similar to the service on a non-DRW day, so I will definitely no be coming back."
1 star rating,"That's what I'm talking about...I travel to eat. My intent is to find the most satisfying items available, anywhere.  DSM was that deal!  What I had there was tremendous. It was the highlight of my trip - foodwise. Things are in good hands. Never worry."
5 star rating,"I'm really not big on bashing any establishment so I will make every attempt to be as positive as I can here. The visit here was rather underwhelming. My first impression was WOW this place looks amazing. The servers looked prim and proper and very diverse from the staff to the customers. The menu was a bit limited compared to what they show on the website however the choices all seemed appealing. BUT they would NOT allow any deviations, additions, deletions nor any adjustments to their offerings. My wife is allergic to tomatoes and ordered a salad that came with tomato (they would not allow her to order it without tomatoes. We both decided to play it safe and get a Caesar salad. We asked if we could add blackened salmon on the salad and we were both SURPRISED they would NOT allow us to order it prepared this way especially since the salad they had with the tomato that she's allergic to had salmon on it. No dice no way NOT happening! So we had a plain Caesar salad $11 was about the size of a side salad that comes with an entree. It didn't have any cheese and the croutons were stale. We also split the lobster Mac and cheese again underwhelming it came out Luke warm cheese was not melted in the middle. The best thing we had was a glass of Meomi Pinot Noir. The service wasn't bad but it's Safe to say we won't be returning."
2 star rating,"Went for Saturday brunch. Had the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Shrimp and Grits. Food was very good, lots of lobster and lots of shrimp in our dishes.  Portions were generous, price reasonable.  Speed of service was ""relaxing"". We'll be back!"
4 star rating,"Service was slow slow slow I think she was new I observed the other servers doing a fine job. We had to ask for wine list / bread / sauce for the crab cakes (which were totally under cooked) / bill / plate for our meal. My Seafood Paella it was basically rice with undercooked vegetables and a few shrimp I had better from the frozen food isle at Kroger. I will say that I gave it a 2 because the ""Lobster Mac & Cheese"" was outstanding!"
2 star rating,"Epic fail!!Let me expound on this - I reserved a table though OpenTable on Jan 21st for dinner on Valentine's Day.  When we arrived, there was no valet in sight, so that option should be removed from their profiles on OpenTable and Yelp - you've now been forewarned.  We arrived 15 minutes early and with the temp hovering at zero, there were really no other options other than the $20 parking lot across the street.  You can always count on the lot vultures to bend you over when an opportunity presents itself and this was strike one in the column of 'Reasons to Not Return'.Next up, no table was available and we were asked to wait in the lounge until something became available.  We ordered a glass of wine - there were no wine glasses at the bar and it was served in an oversized snifter.  We were finally seated 45 min late - strike two.  Granted this was a holiday weekend  - the restaurant was full, but not overflowing.  I had made my reservation weeks in advance, so in my opinion the wait was inexcusable.They had a fixed price, three course special menu for the evening which we ordered off of.  I was disappointed that a number  of prominent items were missing from the regular menu at the restaurant vs. the menu published to their website (starting to see the pattern here?).  Now here is the odd thing about their special menu of the evening - we were informed after finishing our entrees that one of the two dessert offerings had run out at approx. 8:30 that evening.To be fair, the food here was decent - very fresh, nice presentation, but nothing special.  If you're going to do a seafood restaurant, in my opinion you've really got to be on top of your game when it comes to the food.  The other problem here is clearly manager related - we didn't see anyone that even closely resembled a floor manager last night and that's just inexcusable for a busy holiday weekend.  The staff lacked coordination - we had to ask for a bread basket half way through the meal, a different server delivered the entrees and one was the wrong order, the empty appetizer plates were still sitting on the table after the entrees were delivered and we never received additional silverware when the app plates were finally removed - strike three, your out!Two final observations - the live music was waaay too loud this evening (if they had a floor manager, they would have known that) and overall, I would say the dinner represented poor value for the money - I will not return."
1 star rating,"I found the ambiance very nice. We walked in and it was well lit and kind of vibrant. But not too vibrant to the point you wouldn't be able to hold a conversation. They have a piano player on Saturday nights who is GREAT. I suggest getting a booth. They have tables where you sit next to your date/friend/colleague and for me that's a bit much but to each their own. The food was pretty good. I had the stuffed shrimp for an appetizer and that was really, really good. So flavorful. However, my entree left a lot to be desired. The Kenny Special was underwhelming. It is filling but they should redo the seasoning option. The stuffed Salmon though, hot damn it was good! That was seasoned so well. The presentation was very nice of both dishes but the Salmon I recommend. The service was good. It was a little slow but good. Very warm in my experience. I would recommend a try of this place."
2.5 star rating,"Had dinner here last night before a show. It was no quite what we were hoping and we were one of 3 other tables in the place. We both had the stuffed lobster which was good but the butter was cold because they don't serve it over a warmer. The lobster would have been amazing with hot butter! The vegetables and potatoes that accompanied the meal were an afterthought and lacked any flavor.  The chocolate mouse torte we shared for dessert was amazing. The bar service was very slow, we waited 20 mins for two drinks and they were very overpriced at $14! They do have a dinner for 2 for $69 that seems like it would be a good deal, if I went back I would do that."
3 star rating,"We came here with my friend and her husband on a date night.  The ambiance was quiet and romantic.  There weren't many other guests here for a Friday night, and that was ok with me.  I hate having to wait for seating at a restaurant.  Our favorite dishes were the calamari, seafood paella, and the mac and cheese.  We enjoyed the food, but I guess it didn't make a huge impression since we haven't felt the need to return.  I don't think of this restaurant when deciding on where to have dinner."

3 star rating,"One star for the decor. I loved the booths with tied-back curtains...romantic.I had heard so much about this establishment from friends and family who have dined there. My bf offered to take me anywhere I wanted to go on Valentine's Day and of all of the restaurants in downtown Detroit, I chose this one. After our experience there he has put me on ""choice restriction"". Our romantic Valentine's-farewell-for-now lunch was a complete disappointment. The fact that it was V-Day was really no big deal as we always have romantic lunches and dinners, it's sort of our thing. What made the date ""special"" was the fact that he was leaving that night to work in LOUISIANA for FOUR MONTHS!!! We really wanted the last hours we would be able to spend together for a while to be memorable.Well, it was memorable alright...because it was horrible.The waiter was super slow and lazy. His uniform was even disheveled, he looked lazy. We sat there, jealous of the other customers who were being waited on by a swift and attentive waiter. At one point I even shared with our waiter that I had to hurry and get back to work after we waited and waited for our meals. That little tidbit apparently made no difference to him, he still took his time.I won't waste writing creativity by describing what we ordered. Our food was bland and cold. My sides were ice cold and weren't edible.Upon leaving, I was asked by the hostess how we enjoyed our meal. I explained my disappointment to her and was overheard by who I later learned was the CEO of the company. He begged our pardon and insisted that he would ""make it right"". I was hesitant to give his offer the time of day but after he repeatedly insisted that he be able to do something, I took his card.A few days later I emailed him...if I got a reply, you did. We certainly won't return. The place doesn't exist to me."
1 star rating,"I was driving by this place and it looked cool from the outside so I decided to go in. We ordered our food and later finding out they had crab on special and the waitress never mentioned that. We were upset because we would have preferred that. Throughout the night the waitress was just not knowledgeable on any of the menu and it wasn't fun to deal with. We got our food and it was not good at all. For someone who calls themselves Detroit seafood market, they definitely do not have good seafood at all. That food=not worth the price !"
1 star rating,A group of 4.  Last minute decision to have dinner here vs. Bistro 555 at Greektown.Sadly we were all very disappointed!  Our experience will prevent any of us from going back or ever recommending this restaurant.1 walleye dinner appeared to be maybe perch.  The other house special dinner was inedible completely dry and tasteless.  One order of black and blue steak medium with a lobster tail was even more of a disaster.  The steak appeared as maybe flank steak almost raw and NO lobster tail ever came.  All vegetables and potatoes were dry and tasteless.  The manager and server offered to take 15% off our bill and remove items that never came and even offered to buy our table another round of drinks that we just couldn't accept as compensation for such an abysmal dinner.Needless to say we won't return or recommend.
1 star rating,I will here tomorrow to celebrate 60th birthday!!! Hope I'm not disappointed.. there will be 27 ladies in all... hope y'all ready!!!! Well we went today had a good time...kudos to the 2 people that waited on us...worked hard to make it a pleasant!!!
3 star rating,"It's more of a 3.6 from me but I think what bumps it up is the attentiveness of the staff and the daily offering of live music. I was part of a birthday group that came for the Sunday brunch which costs $30 per but its somewhat worth it. Complimentary mimosas, omelet, waffle and meat carving station and a good selection of items to choose from. The place is a decent size for the square footage you get downtown, but given its become a bit of destination spot to see and be seen, they can and should expand towards Gratiot. Other than that, It is clean and upheld pretty well but the bathrooms could use a bit of attention and a bit of a remodel. Costs are pretty up there so prepare yourself to wait in line and spend your cash before you enter."
4 star rating,Restaraunt is very nice and clean. Like the decor but a little too upscale for me. $25 for a seafood alfredo was too pricey for what you got. The $10 calamari appetizer was very good. 2 person jazz bad was nice. Seated close to the hostess stand and got to watch her chew her nails off and throw them in the garbage which is disgusting. Food tasted pretty good but to bad we both got diarrhea very shortly after. Won't be back.
3 star rating,This was the worst experience ever a group of 8 went including 2 children I could write a book with my list of complaints for the high prices it has poor service never will I never go here again
2.5 star rating,"Let me start by saying that this rating is based solely on the customer service (or lack thereof) that I received when trying to make a large party reservation at this ""establishment."" I have eaten here once previously, and would give that experience 4 stars. Balancing that with the less than 1 customer service I just received, I figured a 2 was a happy medium.I began calling this restaurant on Tuesday, November 4th to determine whether or not they could accommodate my party of 30 the following weekend. I originally spoke with Maurice (the manager/event planner). He took down my information, and said they would be more than happy to accommodate us IF they didn't have a club promoter scheduled for a party that night. I thought this was a little odd, seeing that my requested reservation time was WELL WITHIN the restaurant's hours. Anywho, Maurice stated that he would call me back that evening once he checked the books. Fair enough, I thought...The next day, still no call from Maurice. I called the restaurant back & spoke with Nicole (bar manager) since Maurice wasn't in. She gave me the same speech about the club promoters, but stated that she didn't think one was scheduled for the night of my party. Like her counterpart, she ASSURED me that she would contact me later that day to give me a final answer. Fair enough again, I thought...Day 3 rolls around, and surprise surprise! I still hadn't heard back from Maurice or Nicole. This was beginning to turn into restaurant Groundhog Day! I called yet again and spoke to Julius. I'm not sure what his title was, but he proved to be the most helpful of the 3 (though that didn't take much). He apologized for both of their failures in customer service, and gave me an alternate number to reach Maurice, because he didn't want to put anything on the books for me until I spoke back to Maurice directly. Straight to voicemail every time I called it for the next two days!!! Now completely disgusted with the blatant show of disrespect toward a potential customer, I made one final phone call on Sunday (yes FIVE DAYS LATER). I spoke with the infamous Maurice, who had absolutely no recollection of our contact earlier in the week. As I tried to explain the situation, he kept cutting me off asking more questions. He informed me that they did, in fact, have a promoter scheduled...so they would not be able to accommodate my party. When asked why they hadn't told me that five days earlier, he said: ""I can't speak for the others, but somehow I must not have included it in my notes."" Apology? Absolutely not. Reason to never dine there again? Absolutely."
2 star rating,"This place is everything the low reviews say it is.  The place is clean and has kind of fun live music but the trendiness stops there.  Unless the newest trend is to provide overpriced bad food.  I had the lamb chops and they were pretty good.  But the ""garlic"" mashed potatoes were the worst I've ever had and the spinach greens were slimy.  I went with a group and almost everyone had some complaint about their dish.  If it wasn't so expensive it might be worth a try.....but it isn't."
2 star rating,"I visited DSM on Friday September 25 during Detroit Restaurant Week with a group of friends.  I had read MANY reviews before I went (as is habit) and was wary of their online reputation.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the waiter was very attentive and the manger even stopped by a couple times to check on our table. The food was great; I had the salmon salad and another friend got paella whilst the rest of the group ordered off the menu for DRW.  Everything was really tasty and I would go back again as when I checked in it gave me a deal for 50% off drinks and apps during happy hour.  I'm cheap like that.The only complaint I have is that while waiting for the rest of the group we got two drinks which totaled $20, and I hadn't checked in to see a coupon yet.  Besides that, I would definitely go again."
4 star rating,"Let me start off by saying its a cool place with a live band but the food is way overpriced and the quality of the the food is poor. This place was a huge disappointment. I got the Chilean Sea Bass. The fish was over cooked and the rice was under cooked. The veggies that came with the meal was overpriced frozen vegetables. My meal had to be one of the worst seafood experiences. Cashing out took about 30 minutes. This place is hit or miss, and I would not recommend coming."
1 star rating,I'm glad they closed you see god don't like ugly...they could have made it but they had a bald headed lady named  candice managing the place who didn't have the passion nor the skills to make this place great...they was dirty workers in this place..and she allowed filth....workers showed up when they felt like it and came back to work...smh ...workers fist fighting in the kitchen and no one got fired but the ppl who take their job serios..just all backwards..its a shame Kenny let bold management bring the place down...wow...oh well
1 star rating,"I went to DSM on a Saturday night close to Christmas and it was exactly what I was looking for. There was a group of 8 guys that were looking for a lively venue and this place did the trick. I had that seared ahi tuna with sweet chili sauce. I'm a fan of raw/rare fish and this piece of tuna was cooked perfectly. I told the waiter I wanted tuna and to ""just surprise me"" with the preparation, and I was very impressed. Our waiter Jay was very attentive, and while he was extremely busy trying to juggle other tables and our group, overall he made the experience memorable. We also ordered a few other appetizers and everyone seemed to be impressed. The calamari was great as were the oysters Rockefeller. My only qualm with this place was the volume of the live entertainment. It was a little loud, however, like I said, it did contribute to the lively ambiance. I think it's safe to say I'll be returning to DSM."
4 star rating,"My goodness, time flies.  I should have written this review a while ago!Hubby and I went with a group of eight for DRW, and although the place was hopping, service was excellent.  I also want to point out that Detroit Seafood Restaurants seating is ultra comfortable and the oval table makes for good group conversation.  I had the Maryland lump crab cake with roasted corn salsa for an appetizer.  The smoky salsa was an excellent foil for the sweet crab meat.  My entree was Pasta a la Chef: ""Sautéed jumbo shrimp in olive oil with tomatoes, garlic, basil and white wine. Tossed with fettuccine pasta.""  Delicious.  Finally, for dessert I had scrumptious, rich chocolate layer cake with a very nice cup of coffee.   Between the eight of us, we ordered everything on the prix fixe menu and everyone was well satisfied with his or her choices.  The excellent food is accompanied by a decent wine list, which made the meal (and the conversation) even nicer.I am looking forward to returning!"
4 star rating,"I took my 87-year-old grandma to DSM today for lunch, to celebrate her birthday; it was the first visit for both of us. Overall, it was a great experience and I'll certainly be back, but I do have one MAJOR beef. What is hailed and prominently written on the menu as ""Chef Leonardo's Famous Lobster Mac & Cheese"" is a complete farce. If you can find the pics I posted, there is no question about it. Delicious? Yes. LOBSTER Mac & Cheese? Horsesh!t. They are called Langostinos, and even I thought they were even in violation of a judicial ruling, but alas when I looked it up, it was L.A. Superior Court, and they ruled No Decision.Here's what they're calling Lobster and charging you $13 for a tiny side bowl of (note the controversy): en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La… Come on man!?So yes, that pissed me off. Don't lie to me on your menu. I see there are also Lobster Corn Dogs... I have a hard time believing those are lobster, or anything else on the menu called lobster. I'm going to go ahead and assume EVERYTHING that incorporates lobster as an ""ingredient"" is actually Langostino.That said, the ambience was fantastic, loved the hardwood and exposed brick. LOVED the private booths. Sabrina our server was a doll.  I had the Tropical Salmon Salad, also delish, but seriously over-dressed. I'd recommend ordering it with dressing on the side. Grandma was very happy with her Whitefish Picatta, and she's EXTREMELY difficult to please.Will I return, absolutely, just DON'T LIE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS!"
4 star rating,"The place looks nice.  Too bad they just don't care about service.  They weren't even trying and the place was almost empty on a weekend afternoon.The waitress, Alexa or Alexis, was absolutely not paying attention to her job.  She just didn't care.  She was busy with her phone when I could see her and was out of sight most of the time.The appetizers arrived after considerable wait, but we never got napkins, silverware or water.  We asked for them politely.  ""Oh yeah, sure"", she said, not really caring.  She never brought any.  After an even longer wait our dinners arrived and she vanished...again to bring us silverware we asked for...again.  The appetizers were untouched as a result as would be our cooling dinners.I got the ear of a manager who finally appeared and who generously arranged for us to have silverware.The meals were cold now.  We ate a bit and asked for boxes.  The waitress threw the meals away instead.  ""Where are out meals?"", we asked.  ""Uh, I threw them away"", she deadpanned.  ""Why?"", we demanded.  ""Uhh...."".  Great.  Don't let us distract you from your texting.Someone I was with really wanted coffee and took the gamble.  It arrived without a spoon, cream or sugar.  We asked for it...in more ways than one.  It never arrived.  What a shock, right?I have some choice words for the staff and management.I'll leave it to your imagination.Or maybe I'll just text it to Alexis."
1 star rating,Man I love the stuff salmon!!! Took my mom and brother for their birthday and they ordered catfish and said it was the freshest fish they tasted in a long time.  They have live band which went oh so well with the dinner when I went back with the husband.
2.5 star rating,I've been here a couple of times and it was pretty decent but today I am very displeased. They were open for an hour before I arrived. The food was barely luke warm and I have a medical card to allow me to order from the kid's menu and it was not honored. The manager did not deem it important enough to give me an explanation face to face. My waitress explained that the manager said no and she's sorry...
1 star rating,"Took my wife out for a little meal and had a good time.  The live music was good as we watch a lady do her solo dance thing.  We made reservations but was able to get a booth after we arrived.  If a booth is desired, request it during reservation because it got a little more busy (Friday) as the night fell.   The Stuffed Atlantic Salmon is more filling than it appears on the plate and has very good flavor.  The only adjustments is a little more sauce.  My wife Honey Grilled Sea Scallops were a bit on the small side and she added more honey sauce.  The three Scallops side order is larger.  I think the difference is one is panned seared and the other grilled.  There are a couple more items I want to try however,  this is not the costliest but definitively not cheap.  Reserve this for a special outings to impress.  Groupon is a good feeler to see if you might want to try the full menu selections at a later date. Parking lot across the street."
4 star rating,"We went on a Friday night. It was a slow night, and we weren't expecting that. We ordered two Ciroc Coco Loso.The food was delicious. We had the Seafood Platter and the Fried Orange Roughy. Our server Van was great. I will definitely be back. Nice decor. I also posted two pictures with this post as well."
5 star rating,"NO PARKING NO PARKING NO PARKING,  It cost us $50 to park in the lot that was two blocks away - UNACCEPTABLE.  Even though we were only one table of about five in the place they sat us right next to the entrance - I HATE THAT.  Very expensive very small menu.   Took FOREVER to get the food and then to finally get the check.  Service did not reflect the restaurant's supposed classy image. Their credit card machine was broken so they had to manually do the credit payments - and only the manager could process them.  This made us late for our show because she had to go to other tables before us.  Will not be back and will NOT suggest to anyone."
1 star rating,"Disappointed. We went for anniversary dinner. My ahi tuna dinner was cold. The waitress, LaToya, took my plate back. The tuna was warmed up and chili sauce was added on top (not ordered that way). Still cold rice and vegetables. The side lobster Mac/cheese was hot and delicious.My husband loved his twin lobster tails. Drinks were high quality."
2 star rating,"The hot and spicy grouper was very good, but I wasn't a fan of the roasted veggies. They also have happy hour and half price wine bottles. Only four stars because service was slow."
4 star rating,"I haven't been here for dinner but for a lunch spot this place is A-OK! I ordered the crab cake and soup combo and it was so much great food for only 9 bucks. The soup was shrimp bisque and it was smooth, slightly sweet and creamy with the teeniest little shrimp bbs in mixed in. The crab cake was crispy and flavorful, not terribly greasy, and served on a bun with a bit of tartar sauce and french fries on the side. It was a surprising amount of food for not a lot of money, which was awesome. For lunch it was pretty quiet. A few tables were filled but most were empty and we sat in a spacious booth that has curtains on the side you can draw for a romantic or private dinner/lunch which I thought was a nice touch. Not sure I would do it since I think it would make me pretty claustrophobic feeling, but still a nice option. I figured with that much vacancy that our service would be pretty spot on but like a lot of folks mentioned here the service was a bit slow. I'd have to come for dinner for a full assessment but for lunch it was perfect. Great quality food for obscenely cheap prices, and large portions all served in a lovely, comfy space. Now if they could just give the staff some Red Bull....."
4 star rating,"A beautiful space, wonderful service, and food that matched! The Detroit Seafood Market surprised me the other night . . oh not that I didn't expect alot- but from the standpoint that we were one of the few tables occupied on this night. First, there's the space. The re purposed warehouse space is warm and lovely. The ambiance is only amplified by the original wood floors that creak as you walk over them (I do love the character of old buildings!). The bar area is lovely set up with a piano player in the corner- the perfect place to meet friends after work around the curved bar or at one of the stand up tables. The restaurant area is a combination of stand alone tables by the large front windows, contemporary half moon booths that are spacious and comfy as well as cozy closed in booths for two along the back wall. Our server, James was delightful. He had worked for the previous owner and knew the menu and wine list inside and out, helping to make great suggestions along the way. We started with a range of their appetizers- the well touted DSM calamari (big pieces of calamari served with a jalapeno aioli sauce that had quite a kick to it! ) We also had the ahi tuna (served with the same sauce) and their famous crab cake. All of it delicious! My only wish was that the aioli sauce for the tuna had come on the side as it overpowered the taste of the tuna. For entrees- I went with the crab legs and a side of the lobster mac and cheese (shared by the table). Other entrees at the table included a stuffed salmon and their house specialty of the deep fried lobster tails. The food was perfectly prepared and came up at exactly the right time. And dessert! Who could have dessert after all of that, but the table rallied! All the desserts are made in house so we sampled the tiramasu, the bread pudding and the largest dish of vanilla ice cream I had ever seen! All were great but that bread pudding . . . .won my heart (and stomach!)! Finally- the biggest surprise of the night. . . . .this is what I love about Detroit and that is the bill. Dinner for 4 with drinks, appetizers, entrees and dessert only came to $200! In Chicago- this would easily have cost us $350! And parking? There is a manned garage around the corner by the opera house that only costs $5 after 6. Seriously, the best deal of the day! I know the former restaurant that occupied this space (Detroit Fish Market) filed bankruptcy earlier this year. The new owner (since July) has done a nice job of keeping the favorites on the menu and adding some new items that are sure to be favorites. I hope more people try Detroit Seafood Market so it doesn't befall the same fate as it's predecessor as it's worth keeping around. I haven't been in this area of Detroit since I moved away many years ago. It was great to see the comeback (new hotels, restaurants,etc) that the area is having, and to eat at a restaurant where taking care of the customer is the norm! Check this place out!"
4 star rating,I had the Alantic stuffed salmon and my date had the chilean sea bass both was excellent and had a great flavor. The atmosphere was very electric they had a live jazz band on this particular  Friday night. The waitress was excellent as well and very attentive to our needs always checking on us without being annoying. The only downside was the lobster macaroni and cheese is was very dry! The parking was $10 but then again you are downtown Detroit. We will return!
4 star rating,"Restaurant Week we had the scallops and shrimp.  Both were OK, but I won't return. Our waiter's blatant main interest to TURN HIS TABLE OVER made us very uncomfortable. I was still working on my last scallop when desert arrived, followed immediately by the check. When I described the BUMS' RUSH I got from waiter Rico H. to the manager, he started to offer an incentive for my next visit, but I just thanked him and said there won't be a next visit. There are so many great restaurants in this metro area that I'm not going to settle for just OK food with a smiling hidden service agenda. Oh yes, on reviewing the bill later I noticed that Rico overcharged for the wine.This Restaurant Week we are shrinking our bucket list by Detroit Seafood, Top of the Pontch, La Dolche Vita, Cuisine, and Roma Cafe.LOVE $30 RESTAURANT WEEK"
2.5 star rating,"I came here with Dave S. and Brian B. last night. Last time I went was for a media event where they rolled out the best service. Last night I came here as a commoner.-Service was slow. Waiter checked on our table once every 20 minutes.-It took 20 minutes after sitting before we got our soup order in.-After that, It took 20 minutes for the soup to come.-It took a total of 1.5 hours before we saw our entrees. Holy caw.-Refills on beverages were slow: I sat with an empty glass for 15 minutes once.-Waiter didn't glance over too many times when we tried to flag him down.-Food was delicious.-Service was way better after we complained about the speed to the hostess after an hour and a half.-We ordered our drink at 5:50pm. Didn't get out of here till 8:45pm after dessert.Bottom line: food was great. Service was very very bad but was better after complaining to the hostess."
3 star rating,"I was here for a media event the day before the doors officially opened.This place used to be the Detroit Fish Market.  They have new ownership now but the head chef is still the same.  The space looks largely the same as it did when it was the Detroit Fish Market.  The food last night was delicious.They had crab cakes, oysters, shrimp, salmon, chicken with pina colada sauce and plenty of wine.They had a little jazz band there too which added to the atmosphere.This place received flack for bad service and inexperienced waiters before.  The waiters last night were very caring.  They came by all the time to clear plates and get drinks.  Absolutely a wonderful experience.  I'll upload pictures soon."

We were seatedBut noticed none of the patrons had anyFood at there tables, nor was there theSmell of food.After waiting awhile we leftIn search of food. Would love to know what was going on there."
1 star rating,"Worst service, worst food ever. In town for a show, wanted to enjoy a nice casual dinner in the old contemporary setting. After the hostess forgot about us we finally were seated 25 minutes later ( restaurant was half full) Not one wait person even approached us for another 10 minutes.  Continued with poor service, never received our salad and food was over cooked and manager then explained they would remove the salad from our bill. We will never return for dinner here."
1 star rating,"Worst restaurant experience in my life, and I dine out at least 3 times per week in upscale places.  We had a 6pm reservation, I was taking customers for dinner and wanted to treat them to a nice restaurant before a concert at nearby Ford Field.  We were finally seated at 6:45.  Empty tables with dirty dishes were all around us.  A dirty fork was on the floor by my seat, it never got picked up.  Drinks came very slow.  We ordered apps and dinner along with the drinks.  Aps didn't come all together so it was awkward for some eating when others didn't have their food.  Aps were not bad.  The waiter came back once and said they were out of one entree, no big deal, we re-ordered.  At 9pm we finally got 2 of our 4 dinners. The waiter said he didn't know when the others would come.  My dinner was pretty cold.  The other 2 came about 5 min later.  No one checked on us, it was just awful and embarrassing.  The bathrooms were also atrocious, toilet paper all over the floor and none on the rolls.  No apologies, nothing came off the bill, just horrible all around."
1 star rating,"I have been here twice for my brothers birthday and both times I felt like my experience fell flat. Terribly slow service, I'm not sure if it's the kitchen or the waitstaff. Our waitress was sweet but very slow! I love seafood and it's not bad here. I think the atmosphere and what they are trying to sell is a little above what they are capable of."
3 star rating,"Came here for restaurant week with about 7 other people. They had the best menu when we checked a week before restaurant week started. The place is more causal than fine dining. They don't have their own lot but you can find street parking or park across the street in a lot for 7 bucks. It is best to carpool. The restaurant can be a bit loud since they have live music. It is a bit hard to hold a conversation with someone who isn't sitting right next to you. The food was pretty good and I like how they don't skimp. You will definitely be full or have left overs for lunch tomorrow. Overall, the service was good but one of us didn't get their appetizers! The waitress did give her a complementary glass of wine to make up for it but everyone was done eating their appetizer before the matter was resolved. There are two stalls in the women's bathroom and they ran out of paper towels. =/ Overall, the experience was good but not great. If I had a strong craving for seafood I would come back."
3 star rating,"I frequent this restaurant fairly often, but after today I will have to find a new seafood joint in downtown Detroit . We went for the Sunday brunch because we enjoyed it in November 2015. Today was horrible.  The fried chicken wings were old, the Mac and cheese had no flavor, the catfish was fried so soft the cornmeal was cakey. The greens were extremely salty...and I like salt!! The plates were filthy it looked as though they were ""washed"" in coffee grounds and bacon grease...yet there was no bacon on the Buffet. The only redeeming quality of the brunch was the Live smooth jazz music."
1 star rating,"I waited a few weeks to write this review in order to give myself time to put it into perspective. This was truly the worst dining experience I ever had. The restaurant opened late for Sunday brunch. Even though about 15 people were waiting outside in the rain, no employee made an effort to open the doors in time to let us in. I should have taken the hint and chosen a different location. I slipped on some nasty muck on the floor while being taken to my table, again I should have taken a hint. After waiting at the table for 10 minutes a server finally made her way over to take drink orders, mimosas come with the brunch package. It was by far the worse mimosa I ever had in my life. I was trying to figure out how in the heck someone could mess up a mimosa; it is only champagne and orange juice after all. Sadly, I soon found out. As we made our way up to the miserable buffet tables I noticed how the young woman, who had no business behind a bar, was making the awful mimosas .... She was adding cheap and warm champagne, orange juice, and ice to a cocktail shaker. She then did what comes naturally when you are mixing drinks in a cocktail shaker.....SHE SHOOK IT!!If that weren't enough, the ""chefs"" on the omlet station left even more to be desired than the mimosa shaker. The youngest of the two was very inexperienced, adding more oil to the omlet pan than egg. Most disturbing was the fact that the dirty and unorganized omlet station had a tip jar!! What the heck!!Overall the food was horrible, over cooked, over salted, and lousy. You got the feeling it was made days before, maybe even last Sunday brunch, and reheated. For goodness sake, even the grits were bad - GRITS!Save yourself a bad experience and steer clear of this over-priced, sorry excuse for fine dining. I would not go back there even if they paid me to do so.The only positive experience in the entire trip was the jazz musician. He was phenomenal, it is a shame he is wasting his talents in that greasy spoon."
1 star rating,"The worst experience ever. My cousin and I chose this restaurant to have our birthday celebration.  We had a 5:00 pm reservation on the Sunday of Labor day weekend.  We were seated right away. Our waiter James was very attentive so the two stars are for him and the bread.  The venue is old and dated.  It very much needs a coat of paint,  refinement of the floors,  attention to the women's bathroom and repair of their booth cushions. The staff is dressed less that professional.  You would expect the personnel to be dressed in uniforms.  However, several members had on night club attire that was  too tight and showed way more flesh than necessary for a 5pm dinner.  Our food did not come to our table until 6:30 pm. Three of us had the stuffed salmon with mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables.  The salmon came out dry and overcooked,  the potatoes were lukewarm and the vegetables were cold and undercooked.  The whole dish lacked seasoning and flavor.  The other 2 persons in our party got the lobster tails which they both agreed were good, but the entree was a fail due to the vegetables and potatoes as well.  As an out of town visitor I expected more of a restaurant in downtown Detroit.  It was a very disappointing birthday dinner.  I would have been better off going to eat my corn beef sandwich.  Matter fact the chilli cheese fries I had at Layfette Coney island the night before was more appetizing than this place.  If you happen to take a chance on this place the best things are the bread,  and strong alcoholic beverages.  Ask for James because at least he can provide comic relief for this circus."
2 star rating,"My wife and I recently dined at Detroit seafood market during our anniversary weekend. It happened to fall during Detroit restaurant week and we were exceptionally pleased with this restaurant. The service was incredible. Our server, Bennie was very attentive and friendly. The manager welcomed us to the restaurant and treated us as VIPs. And above all else, the food was exceptional! I had the scallops as my entrée according to the restaurant week menu and i have NEVER had better scallops. Ever. Period. If you go here you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend this establishment!"
2.5 star rating,"Beautiful restaurant, the booths are semi private and good for conversation. We ordered mango mahi mahi with mushroom risotto and seafood alfredo (mussels, shrimp, and scallops). Very good food and drinks. Warm bread is served with the meal."
5 star rating,"I feel bad writing this review because I'm all about promoting the city of Detroit but I have to be real. Whenever I'm in Detroit I always pass by this place and wanted to try it. Finally we did tonight. I had to park across the street in the lot for parking which is $10. I walk inside and there aren't very many ppl for a Saturday night at 8pm. I wasn't so into the decor. The floors squeak immensely every time someone walks around. They are old wooden floors and not tiles like most venues. The little booths along the back looked ok and a bit more cozy to have dinner in but they were all taken. There was a band that played live jazz but it wasn't that great. Cliff Bells is 100x better. For starters we had the blue point oysters ($19-east coast and smaller). They were NOT that good and I've eaten oysters at many places. I've had so much better at places like Streetside, Prime + Proper, and Eddie V's. For drinks I had the Island Blue ($13) and the C Bouchi ($15) . I will say the drinks were awesome but a little pricey for this place. At $13 and $15 you might as well head on over to Prime and Proper. But like I said, they are good drinks and the bar area was nice. I would come here just for drinks. I couldn't even finish my 2nd drink bc they were strong which is nice that they were generous with that. I had the orange roughy ($25) as my entree and my friend had the snapper ($23).  Both come with a vegetable and potatoe. The waitress didn't seem to know her menu well and kept having to ask someone in the back for answers to my questions on food and drinks. Also, my friend wanted to substitute his veg for spinach and she said she could do it but there would be an up charge. He was annoyed by that bc most places will sub whatever you ask w/ out hesitation and w/ out an up charge. Anyhow, I had my entree prepared blackened as did my friend. It was very spicy so be aware of that but I like spicy. But I will say I could make this at home myself. I like to experience things that I'm unable to cook myself. I tried my friend's fish that was also blackened and they tasted identical. There wasn't much difference to the roughy and snapper. We did get the chocolate mousse cake for dessert. It was good, but not great. I didn't care for any aspect of the place - the ambiance was dull and dreary, food was average, wait staff wasn't on par, decor wasn't inviting, and the restaurant needs renovating."
1 star rating,"Holy Lobster Mac n Cheese, Batman! My buddy and I split this delectable appetizer and we were not disappointed. The top of the mac n cheese had the breadcrumb crunch that I love and inside was melty, delicious cheese slathered macaroni with generous chunks of lobster meat throughout. I cannot say enough about this dish! I'd come back just for that alone. The service was great and after that heavy appetizer, I opted for a lighter dinner. I chose the seared scallops with rice and mixed vegetables. The scallops were delicious but after dining out at so many places, the plating felt a bit uninspired and straight forward. The rice was just ok as were the veggies. My friend's dish looked incredible. It was the stuffed salmon with lump crab. He was very satisfied with his choice. For dessert we both chose a cheesecake from the dessert menu. I opted for the cheesecake with raspberry & blueberry topping and he had a key lime cheesecake. We both commented on how well done the desserts were and it was a nice end to a great night and a great birthday dinner.  Thanks again, Detroit Seafood Market, you made a fan of me. That Lobster Mac is stuff dreams are made of!"
4 star rating,"Stopped here before the Opera. The hostess was very friendly as well as the waiter. I was with three other people, I order the salmon salad, it was over cooked, bland and rubbery. My other friends ordered whitefish and walleye. Their fish was cold and very dry. We were very disappointed by all the food, we sent everything back. We decided to try the gumbo as a hopeful chance of eating something. The gumbo had a slimy consistency and was loaded with too much pepper. Needless to say, we didn't eat that either, it was so bad. Hopefully they get their act together in the kitchen. The staff here is so friendly but the food needs a major overhaul"
1 star rating,"The buffet on Sunday is really good. It's a brunch which is great because you get to choose breakfast items and lunch food. Like they make custom Omelets, hmmm I also had fried chicken and mac and cheese and bacon. It's kind of like a brunch for Thanksgiving you can eat all you want but it's breakfast foods mixed with lunch food and it all was good. The brunch included miamosa's which I passed on becase I was the driver. Everything I ate was good, this was my first time having brunch here but I will for sure try it again."
4 star rating,"I had been wanting to try Detroit Seafood Market for a long time.  We decided to go on Valentine's Day with another couple.  We made reservations ahead of time and arrived about 10 minutes before our scheduled time.  The host told us our table wasn't quite ready, which was fine since we were early, and told us we could get a drink at the bar...which we tried to do but no bartender would even make eye contact with us or look anywhere near our way.  The bar isn't that large and while all barstools were taken it wasn't overly busy and the bartenders would have had plenty of time to get us a drink but they were lazy and cared not to.We were seated and given a special Valentine's Day menu.  It was kind of disappointing because the offerings weren't that great compared to the main menu - I wish that would have been told us at the time we made the reservations...  Our waiter came, we asked for a drink menu, few minutes later got the drink menu.  The waiter seemed VERY busy despite not having many tables.  After a while after that he finally took our drink and food order.  Four drinks took 35 minutes to arrive....we were talking about actually leaving at this point and should have.  And when the drinks arrived the bellini had gin in it?  Second bellini was no better but at least had champagne in it this time.Food arrived.  The stuffed salmon was good but a super small portion for the large price tag.  The sea bass was some low quality white fish distinguished as sea bass.  Terrible.  Comparable to airplane food.  The surf and turf.  Was suppose to be a 1 lb porterhouse and lobster tail.  The lobster was fine but the porterhouse was a thin extremely low quality piece of meat that couldn't have weighed more than 10 oz (and that's being extremely generous).  It was ordered medium but you could tell it was not cooked to order and way over medium, we have a feeling the kitchen was set like a buffet and the food assembled on plates as ordered.  Will not be returning.  Not sure how this place is even in business."
1 star rating,My brother and I went to all you can eat Crab legs. The legs were big and delicious.  Our waitress kept the warm plates coming. We ate our fill and then some. Definitely worth going back for.
4 star rating,"We ate at this restaurant this past Saturday evening (10/22).  I called ahead to make a reservation for 7pm, but was told there was no availability before 8:15pm.  We live approximately 2 hours from Detroit, so we left quite early to be sure we arrived on time, and ended up arriving around 7pm.  When we arrived, I told the hostess we were early for our reservation, so we waited at the bar for approximately 15 minutes until we could be seated.  At this time, I also requested a booth, and told her we would wait however long it took to be seated in one.  However, she told me we would not be able to be seated at one in the case that a larger party came in.  There were quite a few tables empty (1/4 of the restaurant), and we were seated promptly despite being told there was no availability at that time when I made the reservation.We were seated in a very awkward location, almost in the middle of a aisleway.  There were two booths OPEN right by us that NEVER were seated.  It took 10+ minutes for a waitress to even acknowledge us.  My boyfriend ordered a Coke, and we waited 15+ more minutes until the waitress passed back by and asked what he wanted to drink again because she forgot (I just drank water).  My soup was brought out before she even got back with his Coke, which arrived at the same time our dinner did.  Our drinks, served in tiny glasses, were never once refilled.  We had to stop another waitor to request refills, and again to request our bill.  In passing by, the manager noticed we had our credit card waiting to pay the bill, and took it to ring us up.  All in all, the food was OK.  However, the service was some of the worst service I've ever experienced.  I regret driving 2 hours for a special time with my boyfriend, and I will most likely not be back."
1 star rating,I took my daughter to dinner on her 22nd birthday and ordered the dover sole. This was my first time at the restaurant and her choice. The breading on the fist was too thick and the white sauce that covered the top of the fish was bland. The fish didn't taste fresh but frozen and the vegetables were over cooked. The meal with a tip came to $120.00. This is the first time I've ever written a review but felt compelled because the sole was awful. I would never go back. My daughter and husband had the fried lobster; we all felt like the food was bland and lacked seasoning. Overall experience wasn't good.
3 star rating,"If zero stars was an option I would select it...I was pretty excited to dine on some good seafood when I arrived but that excitement did not last long.  I should have seen the writing on the wall since the place was pretty empty for a Thursday evening.  We were sat promptly in a booth but had to flag down an employee after 10 minutes just to get some water.  After this we ordered a bottle of white wine with a waitress who stated she was not our server but would get us started.  We waited some more... Then our waiter came over and asked if we'd ordered drinks yet and we advised we ordered the wine through his co-worker.  We also told him we wanted the crab cake appetizer to start. We waited some more... Finally, our waiter brought the wrong bottle of wine as it was a red.  Clearly not the the white we ordered which was one for the three featured bottles on the drink menu.  So now we've been seated for 25 minutes or so and had water to show for it.  We politely told the waiter we'd decided to leave and dine elsewhere which we did. Side note.... The men's room was hot and appeared dirty.  The garbage, which was positioned in the vanity top, was also overflowing.  Gross.  Overall, the staff seemed like they all would have preferred to be someplace else.  Perhaps we dined on an off night but looking at some of the other reviews I don't think the experience was an anomaly.  It would take a lot for me to go back again."
2.5 star rating,"I saw reviews online, and was super excited to come here and was highly disappointed by this establishment. First note that the website advertises 50% off drinks and appetizers for happy hour 4-7pm, but it does not say that this is at the bar only. Service was not great, it took 10+ mins for someone to even come to our table. We ordered the crab and spinach dip as an appetizer, which I would rate about a 5 - it was mediocre not great. They gave us about 15 pita chips for the whole appetizer. Then we each got the crab stuffed shrimp, being shrimp and crab lovers. The food came out luke warm and the rice had many many crunchy pieces in it - I'm not sure what they were. The entire time we were eating there was a child a few booths over that wouldn't stop signing and no one said anything. No one at this establishment was friendly to us and we traveled over an hour to get here. I can't said I would recommend this place to anyone and I wouldn't come back. I would hope this has or had nothing to do with us being the only white folks in the establishment. Again, very disappointed."

1 star rating,"I went on my birthday Saturday April 1stThe restaurant was busy. I'd rather have unhurried service. Next visit, will be on a weekday. My dinner was tasty."
4 star rating,"I love this place! I first visited for their Sunday Brunch. I was amazed at the spread, made to order omelettes, waffles, bacon, sausage...even savory sides like mashed potatoes and fried chicken. It was delicious and enhanced by the mimosas and live jazz music. I recently returned for Detroit Restaurant Week and was able to try an even wider range of their offerings. I started with a shrimp, garlic, and tomato appetizer that was delectable. For the main course I had their sirloin steak, garlic mashed potatoes, and veggies. The steak was so delicious and the mushroom sauce served on the side truly enhanced the natural flavors. The potatoes were divine, and well seasoned. Lastly, I had the chocolate mousse torte, which was served with fresh fruit. It was fabulous and just enough to fill my sweet tooth. Additionally, this restaurant offers a wide selection of wine and cocktails, as well as a happy hour on Monday nights! I can't wait to get back here!"
5 star rating,"Okay I visited on May 21. I used a Groupon and I was aware of the limited menu. The service was excellent. The food was good. I compared our order with the cost of items on the regular menu and found the Groupon value was over valued by 50$. Our bill listed our entrees at 16$ each. A friend asked about the Groupon for 4 people, I advised against it. Not the advertised value, the limited menu felt cheap. I would try again because of the service"
3 star rating,"Stuffed full lobster available on Thursday is fantastic. The Moscato wine was amazing, along with the spinach crab a artichoke appetizer was a10! Our first visit was a success, good job!!"
5 star rating,"We came here for restaurant week, and I have to just say...I was so underwhelmed. First off, I ordered a cocktail that was neon green and tasted like something I could have gotten at a frat party. I had ordered the grilled Delmonico Steak, it was ok. The mashed potatoes were kind of dry and the vegetables were nothing special. My bf had the parmesan encrusted tilapia and it was SO fried. Like so deep fried, that you couldn't even taste the fish underneath. Not a great choice.The best part of the meal was by far the dessert: the chocolate mousse tort had a light cake on the bottom and delicious cream on top. Totally the highlight.And, I have to say, our server was cheerful and attentive, and I enjoyed the ambiance of the place. But I'm not sure if I will bother to go back!"
3 star rating,"reserved via Open Table based on reviews.... I should have kept looking after our dining experience last night. crab, spinach and artichoke dip - wheres the crab?Stuffed Salmon - it was okay.  good, yes, great? no.crab cakes - again, it was okay.  great? no.Service was ""okay"".  nothing memorable.What stood out was how LOUD the live music was.  Seriously loud. Finally after struggling to hear our waiter many times and even the manager, I asked if they could have the band turn it down many notches.  Which they did.Atmosphere? meh.  Would we return? no.  Don't get me it wrong, its not a bad spot, but it just wasn't worth the 60 minute drive for the price, quality and experience."
2 star rating,Checked out this place during Detroit Resturant week last week and was disappointed. The service was extremely slow and the food was horrible and overpriced.
1 star rating,"Food was good but the wait for drinks, bread, and the main courses was almost unbearable."
2.5 star rating,"I wanted to have 30th birthday here. They charge $200 deposit for parties over 10. I went to location and waited for 20 minutes while manager handled something next door. When she came over I asked her for her help and she stated she still was busy. Not only was it inconvenient to have to drive there to make reservation and pay, but my time and respect was clearly not valued in this establishment. I have dined here in the past over the last few years, but I don't intend on coming back. The menu outside looks horrible, carpet coming up, servers unprofessional. To upscale of price for mediocre."
1 star rating,"Disappointing dining experience. Overpriced for the lack of quality and freshness. The food was salty, shrimp was small and the sautéed vegetables were cooked to mush. Additionally, the bathrooms are filthy and in disrepair. Will not return."
1 star rating,"It's a shame we can't give 0 stars on Yelp.My girlfriend and I planned to have a super date and when we pulled up to the restaurant, we realized there was no valet parking or designated spots (I acknowledge that this makes me sound bougie) for the restaurant, so we ended up going around the corner to the Radisson hotel lobby and bought a $2 Snickers bar to get change for street parking - we thought it would be worth it :)We arrived on time at 5:45PM and were seated rather quickly.  Our busboy was very pleasant and brought us water right after being seated. About 15 minutes later, no server stopped by to take drink orders or say 'hello', so the bus boy came around to give us bread out of pity; he noticed we had been waiting for a while and felt bad for us.  We could tell, because he stopped making eye contact with us :/At this point, we started to creep.  There was a couple seated right in front of us and we were seated at one of the outward facing booths that looked out at their directly - kind of an awkward voyeuristic experience actually :(.  I'm sure it wouldn't have been so awkward if we had appetizers or drinks at this point, but we watched as their server came by and took their drink and appetizer orders, cleaned their house, and did their taxes* - it only fueled our frustration.  At this point, we had been waiting for 25 minutes and that Snickers bar was starting to look pretty good.After a total of 35 minutes (yes I had a stopwatch going), we asked our busboy if a waiter/server was assigned to our seating area, and he went into the kitchen area to figure out who was assigned to our table.  Another 10 minutes passed, and he stopped by to check and see if our server had taken our order yet.  Unfortunately, our orders were not taken and we asked him how much we should leave for eating the bread, and he said, ""it's cool, you can just book it"".  He was a really nice guy, so we tipped and went on our next adventure.We waited a total of 45 minutes and we witnessed the following things:- There were a handful of servers who had nothing to do and stood around in every corner of the restaurant; they would hide behind walls around the kitchen, the window area of the restaurant, and behind the curtains.  They were just just shootin' the shit.  I'm a millennial and even I was disgusted by the lack of shame and concerned for the future of our workforce. #soft- The front of house manager (wearing an orange shirt - different from serving staff) walked around a lot, did not check in with patrons, and would randomly call groups of staff to the corner to 'game plan', but I'm pretty sure they were shooting the shit as well, because they would just walk away laughing after and nothing would change. - The front of house manager had no plans for turning tables and I'm pretty sure the seating system was a game of solitaire...- The busboys were hustling hard and very helpful.  The bread was bangin'.We were really hoping to have a fun night, but ended up with some pretty poor customer service.  I wouldn't blame the servers - it looked like there were too many to begin with and nobody was giving them any direction.  Even MJ needed to be led**.Luckily, we had an awesome Snickers dessert on our way around the corner to Punch Bowl Social and had a great time there.  I would highly recommend their Blueberry Lemonade and Chicken and Waffle entree :)  Their ginger strawberry jam was pretty bad ass too.  We ended up buying a jar of it before leaving - awkward ask, but they were totally willing.  A little to hipster for my style, but they accommodated that as well by keeping the rosemary sprigs out of my drinks.  Skinny jeans, gauged ears, and rustic taxidermy just don't add up for me.All in all, we were able to recover from the horrible experience, but I have a feeling that Detroit Seafood Market won't have an easy time based on this and many other reviews that show signs of a failing business.  Ramsay would tear this piece up!Best of luck, DSM! Punch Bowl Social is right around the corner if you're still hungry after water, bread, and butter :). We also recommend the Radisson lobby Snickers selection. #clutch*Some embellishment added to make light of a devastating experience :)**MJ never needed to be led."
1 star rating,"The lobster bisque was outstanding, actual large chunks of claw. Service was also excellent! I will definitely be returning."
4 star rating,"The worst restaurant experience I have had in a while. We waited 20 minutes for water on a Monday night. 20 minutes after that, we ordered our meal. Mind you, not even half of the restaurant was full. 30 minutes later we received lukewarm soup and had to ask for refills on water. Roughly 30 minutes later we received our meals. The meals were mediocre at best, and ridiculously over-priced for what we received. I realize that ordering chicken Marsala at a seafood restaurant is always a gamble, but it was a piece of wood smothered in sauce. No bueno. The lobster tails came with a cup of melted margarine that remained in liquid form even when cool. The Delmonico steak tasted like blackened feet. Everyone's rice & mashed potatoes were room temperature. The gumbo was bland. The lobster bisque would have been decent if it were 20 degrees hotter... For a better price, I could go to Mitchell's and have a way more delicious meal with a shorter wait time. Our waitress, although very kind when present, could not be found when we needed her.I will not be returning to the Detroit Seafood market."
1 star rating,"Detroit Seafood Market is a great place to take someone special for a dinner or a group to impress if you can get past a few minor issues.First, I'll second some other comments about the front of the house -- they are far too inattentive and you end up standing there for much longer than you should, particularly if you have a reservation. And it's not because they're swamped, the hostess just vanishes for a while. Also, DSM, you *really* need to fix the broken glass on the door and the menu outside. Not at all acceptable for an upscale place, not to mention a safety issue.The food is fantastic. The stuffed salmon is out of this world, and the other few dishes I've had are also great. The service is good, but on the slow side. It takes a bit longer than it should to get drinks, bread, apps, and your food. I'm not sure if it's paced that way on purpose, I think it might be since they only offer reservations on the hour and because the server asked if we were going to the theater.Most of the times I've been here have been with a Groupon, we stocked up when they offered them. If you don't have one, I guess the prices might be a little on the high side, but the quality justifies it.Give DSM a try -- the interior is fabulous and the food is very solid. Just make sure to leave yourself some time for a leisurely meal."
4 star rating,"This place is one of THE WORST restaurants I've ever been to.  Between the rude waitstaff and the lousy portions, I would have been better off eating at Long John Silvers!"
1 star rating,"Third time here since they opened and each time it is a better experience. They let me use my $60 Groupon on the main menu ($57 credit) in lieu of the standard Groupon menu.It was a Sunday night, so service was much better than previous visits. Calamari appetizer was outstanding and the main course fish meals were tasty, well prepared and gigantic. Highly recommend for a nice casual seafood dinner in a very chill atmosphere. Live jazz on most weekends I believe."
4 star rating,A groupon special led me here.scallops as an appetizer proved to be a good choice. Martinis were great. The sea bass was quite good also. Stuffed lobster was tasty also. Took home the cheesecake dessert and it was decent also.bottle of white haven wine at 30 bucks was fairly priced. Plan on at least 10 bucks for parking. Restroom was really torn up.and could have been cleaned.
4 star rating,"Some of the fish was rancid. All of the fish was fishy tasting. In other words, it went from not fresh to just rotten. The service was very nice, and the manager took all the food off of our bill, because it was all inedible. If the health department doesn't shut them down first, the lack of customers ought to send this dreadful restaurant to its final reward.I neglected mentioning that we made a reservation on OpenTable and when we arrived the hostess told us they had deleted our reservation because we were late. The place was 2/3 empty, but she made a point of telling us she'll see if they can seat us.  Just one more detail why this place needs to go out of business."
2.5 star rating,"Ordered my food to go at 7. Got an email shortly after that said order will be done at 7:19. Showed up around that time and was told ""not quite done yet"" by a bartender. Sat and waited until 750 to get my food. The reviews on here are very accurate when talking about being ""slow."" Won't waste my time by coming back/ ordering from them again."
1 star rating,Good food good location but the service is very slow.  Arrived at 545 pm and still waiting for our food at 715pm.  Looks like we'll miss the start of the red wing game.
2 star rating,"This was a disaster from the minute we walked in. The hostess had her eyes glued so hard to get iPhone, she barely had time to look up and say hello. We waited over 10 minutes to be seated even though we had made reservations several days prior and the restaurant was half full. Our sever came to our table and the disaster became progressively worse. If you done here, avoid having Bennie E as your server, just a recommendation.We relieved service you would expect from a local Coney Island establishment, not one who serves lobster and steak and prides itself as upscale. The food was ok, the atmosphere was alright but the terrible service from start to end made this a very unpleasant experience. When you have very little time to dine out, you expect to enjoy yourself when you do and this unfortunately was anything but enjoyable."
1 star rating,"This was by far the worst dining experience we have had in a long time. From the waiter to the food, just plain awful. The minute we walked into the door, after making reservations a few days before, we waited 15 minutes to be seated. By the time we were seated, our waiter had an attitude. We didn't know anything about the restaurant, it was our first visit. We asked him what their most popular drink is, and he was annoyed about giving us details. We ordered a Bellini, which was supposed to taste like peach and champagne; but instead tasted like robitussin, had strawberries floating in it and had no champagne (or if there was champagne then it was flat and old). The drink made no sense! Appetizers were decent, the lobster Mac and cheese was not a big deal in my opinion, but their oysters were great! I ordered the steamed king crab legs, which came out cold and a side of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. The waiter argued with me after I sent back the spinach telling him that I asked for creamed spinach, not steamed spinach. After a minute long argument, he walked away rolling his eyes. He came back 10 minutes later telling me that the creamed spinach would be out, after I had already finished my meal. I told him to cancel it and he argued that they were on their way, and I once again told him to cancel it. I didn't ask him to order it again, he walked away in the middle of my sentence. The worst part is that they charged us extra to have spinach as a part of my meal, and after all the hassle, we were still charged extra for the spinach even though I did not eat it. To avoid any further arguments, we took whatever was extra on our bill out of his tip."
1 star rating,"This place has decent food , high prices and when I ordered the lobster it was cold and there was still some shell! At least the service was good"
3 star rating,"I had been wanting to try Detroit Seafood Market for a long time.  We decided to go on Valentine's Day with another couple.  We made reservations ahead of time and arrived about 10 minutes before our scheduled time.  The host told us our table wasn't quite ready, which was fine since we were early, and told us we could get a drink at the bar...which we tried to do but no bartender would even make eye contact with us or look anywhere near our way.  The bar isn't that large and while all barstools were taken it wasn't overly busy and the bartenders would have had plenty of time to get us a drink but they were lazy and cared not to.We were seated and given a special Valentine's Day menu.  It was kind of disappointing because the offerings weren't that great compared to the main menu - I wish that would have been told us at the time we made the reservations...  Our waiter came, we asked for a drink menu, few minutes later got the drink menu.  The waiter seemed VERY busy despite not having many tables.  After a while after that he finally took our drink and food order.  Four drinks took 35 minutes to arrive....we were talking about actually leaving at this point and should have.  And when the drinks arrived the bellini had gin in it?  Second bellini was no better but at least had champagne in it this time.Food arrived.  The stuffed salmon was good but a super small portion for the large price tag.  The sea bass was some low quality white fish distinguished as sea bass.  Terrible.  Comparable to airplane food.  The surf and turf.  Was suppose to be a 1 lb porterhouse and lobster tail.  The lobster was fine but the porterhouse was a thin extremely low quality piece of meat that couldn't have weighed more than 10 oz (and that's being extremely generous).  It was ordered medium but you could tell it was not cooked to order and way over medium, we have a feeling the kitchen was set like a buffet and the food assembled on plates as ordered.  Will not be returning.  Not sure how this place is even in business."
1 star rating,"I LOVE seafood so I was so excited to dine here BUT my excitement was quickly extinguished when I called to make reservations. I called today (Thursday) at around 2pm. The first time I called, the phone rang and rang. No one answered. I called back about 5 minutes later and while someone answered this time, the person mumbled and spoke rapidly. ""Hold please"" was the only phrase I was able to understand. I waited but I was so confused by how the phone was answered, I double checked the number to make sure I had called the right place.When the young man returned to the call, I explained that I was interested in hosting a birthday dinner with a party of 20 the following Saturday. Either lunch or dinner would work. I just wanted a reservation during the least busiest time. He told me that reservations were pretty light during lunch and dinner and asked what time I would be interested in. I said 3pm would work best and I was in the process of asking another question when he cut me off.He said (in a not so welcoming tone): ""Well, first off, for a party that large I would need a $200 deposit and there will be no separate checks. The $200 would be applied to your final bill. Are you still interested in making a reservation?""I told him I was still interested but I needed to speak with my husband first. A sensible request, I thought, but he seemed to take offense to that and rudely said ""Well, call back then."" Okay, I thought.I didn't recall him introducing himself so I asked for his name. He mumbled ""Julius"" and when I asked him to spell it because I didn't want to mispronounce his name, he rambled off the spelling, told me to have a good day and quickly hung up the phone. I have never had such a terrible experience when simply trying to reserve a table!If Julius' intention was to deter me from making a reservation, it worked. I have no problem paying a deposit and I am certain my friends and family wouldn't mind bringing cash so I'm not offended by their policy for large parties. What offends me is the lack of patience and the impoliteness the representative displayed when taking a simple reservation. A RESERVATION!  If his impatience and insolence is any indication of their service and the quality of their food then I want no part of it. Simply unprofessional."
1 star rating,"I'm so sorry to say that DSM is not very good. 1st. We came in the door and literally stood for at least 4 minutes until we decided to wave down someone to seat is. The person to check to see if he could see us. The person he was checking with looked up at from her cash register in an unapproving way. Ok so we sat, and sat. And sat and finally I flagged down a waiter to help us and we sat and sat and finally I waived down. Ok ok you get the picture. End result, for the price you pay the presentation and blandness of the food makes you almost angry. They filled up a glass full of wine. It was put in the wrong type glass. Really!? You fill the glass up. Wrong. I wish it was worth four stars. But alas."
2 star rating,"My husband and I went on a Sunday evening so the ambience was very comfortable and quiet. The food was very well seasoned and the portions were more than enough. The restroom was a little messy but the hostess was right on it. If you ever wanted to try paella but couldn't due to some of the ingredients, they offer great alternatives even for the vegetarian without loss of flavor. Will go again!!"
4 star rating,"Visiting from Philly and idk what I walked into but it was a good night. The bul Phil is a damn good bartender and deserves a raise. I didn't want for nothing with him around. If I'm ever back in Detroit, I'll be back.. The snapper was good too."
2.5 star rating,"We visited on 1-2-16The atmosphere is pretty nice - more like a old fashioned piano bar feeling. There were very few people, especially for a Saturday night. The wait staff was okay, but not very friendly. Service is very, very slow. We were in no hurry, so this wasn't a problem for us.Apparently they are known for their fried twin lobster tails - never heard of such a thing, but I ordered that. It was pricey, but very good and tender, although quite greasy. The dessert we shared was a raspberry mocha cheese cake that was truly excellent!Entrees were over priced I think for what they were. All in all a fairly nice place, would maybe visit again, but mostly for the dessert."
3 star rating,This experience was wonderful all around! The staff was efficient and friendly. The food was to die for! My cocktail 7th Heaven was soooooo good! The restaurant itself is gorgeous with a great vibe. Definitely this is my new spot in downtown Detroit.
5 star rating,Food was good but pricey. Wait staff seemed a bit uninterested and slow. The atmosphere was a nice step back in time. Don't think I'll be back.
3 star rating,"Had dinner on New Year's Eve... Went in with a decent expectation which was crushed instantaneously. The service was HORRIBLE! Long periods of time would pass without a waiter in sight. Some of the staff were rude. We had to wait forever and ask for everything. The waiters didn't even come around to refill our water. We had to request utensils. The food was pricey and of average quality at best. One waiter for maybe 10 tables, definitely understaffed on a day like New Year's Eve. Never going back again"
2 star rating,"I went to DSM on a Saturday night close to Christmas and it was exactly what I was looking for. There was a group of 8 guys that were looking for a lively venue and this place did the trick. I had that seared ahi tuna with sweet chili sauce. I'm a fan of raw/rare fish and this piece of tuna was cooked perfectly. I told the waiter I wanted tuna and to ""just surprise me"" with the preparation, and I was very impressed. Our waiter Jay was very attentive, and while he was extremely busy trying to juggle other tables and our group, overall he made the experience memorable. We also ordered a few other appetizers and everyone seemed to be impressed. The calamari was great as were the oysters Rockefeller. My only qualm with this place was the volume of the live entertainment. It was a little loud, however, like I said, it did contribute to the lively ambiance. I think it's safe to say I'll be returning to DSM."
4 star rating,I was somewhat disappointed with the service. Ordered items that never came including my drink. The food that I actually received was ok. Surprised that our order was incorrect when the restaurant wasn't that busy.
2 star rating,We arrived at our reservation time. We were seated promptly. Then we were told we were put at wrong table.  Ordered drinks and wine was served in plastic wine glasses! Really??  Service was very slow. We waited almost an hour for our food. Asked why we were waiting so long waiter responded with I have 2 tickets ahead of you. When food arrived it was good.  Very noisey! Would not go back since we expected more from that caliber of resteraunt.

2 star rating,I had the Alantic stuffed salmon and my date had the chilean sea bass both was excellent and had a great flavor. The atmosphere was very electric they had a live jazz band on this particular  Friday night. The waitress was excellent as well and very attentive to our needs always checking on us without being annoying. The only downside was the lobster macaroni and cheese is was very dry! The parking was $10 but then again you are downtown Detroit. We will return!
4 star rating,"Came here for all you can eat crab. Service was just ok, as was food. My plate took longer than everyone else's which was annoying, and I felt like the waiter forgot about me (10 minutes later.....) Soup was SUPER salty and cold."
2.5 star rating,"Got there about 9 pm or so on Saturday night, party of 3.  There were people there, but definitely open tables, so not overly busy.  They were out of the mac and cheese.  We ordered simple drinks - wine, gin and tonic, white russian.  It took about 10 min for them to arrive - the bar was maybe 30 feet from us and wasn't busy.  The food took at least 30 min to arrive.  We finished our first drinks, waited at least 10-15 min for waiter to come by and ask if we wanted another.  Food finally arrived, and drinks still weren't there.  They arrived while we were eating.Food was very good - 3 very large crab cakes, but the rice was dry and uninspiring.  Hubby's twin lobster tails were deep-fried(the server said roasted)?  He said they were ok, but the cooking method took away from the taste of the lobster.  My daughter had the Hot and Crunchy Grouper, which was good.Unfortunately, slow service when they are not that crowded bugs me.  I probably won't be back.  I would have preferred Sinbads."
2 star rating,"Another great experience...Waiter (David) was professional, knowledgable and friendly. All his suggestions were spot on! We ordered from the pre-fixed menu (offered on Mondays)... And that was a superior choice, outstanding value and awesome selections... Nothing negative to say... I will return soon...."

5 star rating,Service was awful. Server was not attentive and not very personable. He also doubled as the bar tender and was unsure how to make the drink I ordered. I ordered the salmon which was good but my boyfriend ordered the chicken and it was completely over done. Not worth the price you pay.
2 star rating,"I came here with a party of 10 and 4 of us ordered the fried lobster. After waiting 45+ minutes, we were told they only had enough lobster for 1 order. I'm still trying to figure out how you are called the Detroit Seafood Market and run out of lobster...total oxymoron. I forgot to add it was on a Sunday at 4:30 pm. Also, there were no other patrons in the restaurant at all at the time besides my party. It was completely empty with the exception of the staff and us. This was my first time here and my last."

1 star rating,We arrived at our reservation time. We were seated promptly. Then we were told we were put at wrong table.  Ordered drinks and wine was served in plastic wine glasses! Really??  Service was very slow. We waited almost an hour for our food. Asked why we were waiting so long waiter responded with I have 2 tickets ahead of you. When food arrived it was good.  Very noisey! Would not go back since we expected more from that caliber of resteraunt.
2 star rating,"This place blows! My wife and I stopped in for a drink and an appetizer. It was a Saturday 5 pm, place was half full at best. We grabbed two seats at the bar, as we knew we weren't having dinner. Ordered a half dozen oysters and a crab avocado stack. The bartender after taking our order 10 minutes prior informed us that they were out of oysters. Ok???? It's a Saturday and 5 pm, how the hell does a seafood place run out of oysters that early? So at this point we just decide to go forward with the crab and avocado stack. Took about another 20 minutes for it to arrive. I really wish I would have taken a picture. It was about the size of a silver dollar and an inch thick. The crab meat was awful and the avocado had almost turned brown. Mind you this is a $13 appetizer that we finished in 2 bites. If the ingredients were quality, maybe I'd be ok with it. This was hot garbage. I'll stick with Joe Muer's for seafood in Detroit."
2 star rating,Goes out to the manager Phil. Who is working to enhance the service skills.  Good luck Phill.  Thanks for redeeming my 3rd attempt DSM.
3 star rating,LORD HAVE MERCY ! ! ! ! !!  First of all one person needs to count and the other leave the registrar alone.    We got SUPER OVER CHARGED.... we had 18 people four kids under the age of 12 and they tried to charge us for  28 people... now mind you this is their Sunday brunch that cost 30 a head.... wow   so any who the food was par and the service could had been a tad bit better.     YES WE STILL TIPPED our servers cause it was the right thing to do.Oh the RIBS are the BOMB ! ! ! ! !
2 star rating,"The food was excellent,  but overpriced.  The  service was terrible. There were only a few other tables occupied,  but everything took forever.  We never got our water refilled as promised,  and not all the food came out at the same time.  We finally had to take our bill up to the bar to pay it,  and then the server and bartender were fighting with each other. Extremely unprofessional,  especially for the prices we paid."
2 star rating,"I attended Detroit seafood market during restaurant week. The food was good, not great; but good enough for me to go back. However, I would only go If I were already downtown; I wouldn't go downtown specifically to eat at this restaurant. The service was just ok and the portions were pretty small, but they may be due to the minimized menuOn a side note this place turns into a hot spot at night great club spot combined with the club space next door."
2.5 star rating,Went here for an early dinner.  My two dinner companions were using the Groupon.  Our waiter was fantastic.  Told us about the fresh Chilean Sea Bass that I ordered. He brought all three sauces to taste with it. We had wonderful NZ mussels and a lobster Mac and cheese. We had three house made desserts that were a perfect ending to a delicious and perfect dinner. With all the new restaurants in Detroit it's easy to forget the ones that have been around and stayed.  We will definitely go back. Nice live jazz music in the bar area was just getting started when we left. Our waiter said they recently hired a new chef.  I have had some slow service here in the past but not this evening.  I hope everyone who had a less than great experience will give it another chance. We spent almost an hour and 45 minutes truly enjoying our dinner and the service.
5 star rating,"My husband and I went on a Sunday evening so the ambience was very comfortable and quiet. The food was very well seasoned and the portions were more than enough. The restroom was a little messy but the hostess was right on it. If you ever wanted to try paella but couldn't due to some of the ingredients, they offer great alternatives even for the vegetarian without loss of flavor. Will go again!!"
4 star rating,"The atmosphere here is kind of cool and the location is great. That's about all the positives I have for you here. To be frank the food and service at DSM need to be overhauled, especially for what they are trying to charge. Don't get me wrong, I'm completely fine with spending money on a nice meal with excellent service, but it has to be worth it. I will say that with a few tweaks this restaurant cold turn itself into something special.I had the gumbo and it was alright. I'll admit that I am a bit hard to please in this department since I was born in New Orleans and quite frequently get to enjoy authentic cajun cooking when I return home to Texas. We also had the DSM steamer bucket and stuffed salmon. Both were acceptable. Nothing here really blew my mind....accept for the price when compared to the quality."
2 star rating,"The experience was horrible. My bridal shower brunch was hosted there on a Saturday afternoon, the overall restaurant was empty so the lack of service can't be blamed on a busy crowd. My entire group was disappointed. Food came out cold and very bland, we were told by the server the cook forgot to turn on the rice that's why it was cold, unacceptable! The entire experience sucked especially for it to be a special moment for me, that they  knew about in advance. I will never go back there and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
1 star rating,Not so good. Server was very friendly but kitchen was very slow. My husband ordered bacon wrapped scallops and he liked them but I ordered broiled Chilean sea bass and it was NOT Chilean sea bass. They claimed it was the bass dish for the night which was really not good at all - very dry with really no taste and $29 to boot. They refunded the price of my dinner with no problem. Probably wouldn't go back.
1 star rating,"I went for lunch with a group of friends on a Friday afternoon. We walked in and the inside is beautiful, despite there being no one else there. Our waiter was a character, nice, but a bit intrusive. He made some weird jokes that were funny in the beginning but were just annoying by the end. For example, my friend used her card to pay for the bill and he came back straight-faced and told her it had been declined. Panic and embarresment washed over her face and it wasn't until she started digging through her purse to try another one that he said he had been joking. The biggest disappointment, however, was that I ordered the grilled ahi tuna sandwich. When our food arrived he had brought me the completely wrong dish! Looking back I wish I had just taken the one he had brought on accident... He apologized and promised he'd get the right dish out in no time. About 5 minutes later of me watching my friends eat their food he came back, apologized again and said, ""Just 2-3 more minutes I promise it'll be right out"". I thought, ""Okay I can do 2-3 minutes."" Well it wasn't until about 15 minutes later he brought the plate out to me. I bite into the sandwich and it was pretty good at first. Unfortunately, I took a few more bites and found that the middle of the piece of tuna was 100% raw. So raw that even though its okay to eat raw tuna, I just couldn't. It was the brightest pink color and incredibly chewy. I tried bites of my friends' food and they were all pretty good. However, I left sorely disappointed and out of $17 for nothing. I would never risk going there again."
2 star rating,"I'm sad to say that Detroit Seafood Market gets my first 1 star review. So disappointing, since the location, building and even menu have so much potential.So why the 1 star? Well, let's start with I HAD A RESERVATION and 45 minutes went by and still no table. It started by them offering us ""a table we don't think you'll like"" (yes, the host said that, and he was correct - so why are you offering that table to anyone?). So he offered to let us wait for a different table and 45 minutes went by without even a word or someone taking a moment to let us know they were working on it.Here's the real kicker. While we waited, we sat the the ""bar"" (I put that in quotes, because I'm not sure it qualifies) and it was the most horrible restaurant bar experience I think I've ever had (and I've sat at a LOT of bars!).  The one bartender was so obviously unhappy about being there that I was wondering if I should make drinks for him instead. When he finally got around to taking our order it was clear he knew nothing about mixing even the most basic cocktails and we were explaining to him how to make the simplest drinks. Then, we overheard that they were out of Absolut (wtf?), but he didn't even suggest an alternative or offer a better vodka to make up for it. C'mon!Now it gets gross. A second bartender returned and they bantered back and forth about something being wrong with the water in the sink for washing glasses. She kept saying it was the wrong soap or something and they just laughed and kept putting improperly washed glasses on the shelf. Um, okay. And there's more... this oh-so-cheerful bartender was waiting on the couple next to us and when he grabbed the cocktail napkins out of the holder he LICKED HIS FINGERS to get the napkin! EWWWW! Then he proceeded to mix drinks...So that was it, we got up and left. And I'll never be back. Unless they get new owners and all new staff. Then maybe with a groupon I'd be willing to try again... Skip this place when in Detroit. Go to UDetroit next door for the Lobster Mac if you must try it, but stay away from Detroit Seafood Market."
1 star rating,"Despite a really great location and pretty decent ambiance, I have to give this place an ""A-OK"", but not a super great.  The food was okay, the service was okay, the drinks were... well... I had to send my first martini back. Round 2 was much better (they told me for round 1 they had a new bartender they sent home. I guess I expected a little more out of place in this price range)The Lobster Mac & Cheese was pretty fabulous. I also had the Seabass served blackened. The fish was good, nothing that knocked my socks off though.The service started out okay and our waitress was friendly, but it took so long to finally get our bill we had to go up and track her down. That kind of thing always bums me out when you're dropping this much coin.I think they have a beautiful restaurant with a lot of potential. I hope they just tweak a few things to make this a truly great experience."
3 star rating,"I really wanted to like this place,  but it was terrible, period. I give my husband an A for effort taking me out for a lovely meal but this was not the place. The ambience was nice so I thought this was going to be a great night. However we started with bread that was clearly over baked and looked like the rolls from the freezer section in the grocery store. Secondly, I ordered gumbo which was 90% rice 10% unflavorful gumbo. My husband ordered calamari which turned out to be fried clam strips they were trying to pass off as calamari.. I know what calamari looks like not one ring or tentacle was in the bunch. I got steam crab legs which were okay and my husband got a lobster tail. His sauteed vegetables were completely undercooked and under seasoned. Overall for the price you pay you should get better food. As a visitor from out of town I would suggest to anyone to not eat here, don't waste your money, and go somewhere else. Should have taken notr when everyone in there only ordered drinks."
1 star rating,"Went here last night after our original late night reservations flaked out on us.  I love this place, always gives me exactly what I want.  Wonderful food, unrushed service, good music.  My date ordered the crab legs with a lobster add on and a ceaser salad.  I detoured from my favorite twin fried lobster tails and tried the bacon wrapped scallops with a fried tail add on with the market salad I love!  I wanted to make sure that I tested other dishes from this place to see if they had the same magic.  I was not disapointed.  We even had to have dessert.Once again, a home run - and we WILL be back again!  Thanks DSM for saving the night!"
5 star rating,"I have been here twice now in the past 5 months and both times I have had a great experience.  The price of the food is reasonable considering the ambiance, service, presentation, and taste.  I enjoy the chefs market mixed green salad - it's fabulous!  The martinis are great too.  The last time we were there, they had a special on a bottle of champagne that could not be beat.  It was a nice touch to our already enjoyable dinner.I'm a lobster lover and enjoy the fried twin lobster tails.  My date is a stomach the size of a bottomless pit when it comes to seafood and ordered the crab special with a side of crab legs (seriously that would usually not be enough)... and he was even shocked at how much crab meat he had to work with (a first in eight years).  The place was closing and we never felt rushed.  The lights were dimmed but service was still excellent and actually provided a romantic feel rather than a ""hurry up and get out"" feel.  I will be back again - this has become my number one seafood spot esp. when price +ambiance is considered.  Highly recommend.  One of the better dining experiences I've had in a while.P.S. Most Wednesday have all-you-can-eat crab between certain hours.  I have not been, but it is something I plan to enjoy soon.  *Also, I believe this place was a part of the upromise program.  I'm not 100% if it still is, but as a mother to a young son I was really excited to see that I can eat great food AND put money towards my son's college fund!"
5 star rating,"Wow-Well-Um! I wish I could break down my stars on Yelp sometimes because an overall score doesn't always represent what is going on.  I had this talk with the bartender who felt that Yelp was all about slamming restaurants, which is isn't.The atmosphere is beautiful and very clean The band was really awesome. They ended early to go play at Bakers. The staff couldn't be more friendly or courteous. I believe one of the ladies was Chantrise (not sure of the spelling). She was great-very fun and attentive. The other lady (didn't get her name) very much the same. The food that I've had (Except the beloved Mac and Cheese) beyond criminal. This is my second visit and probably my last. The first time was during the Tigers home opener. We ordered 4 appetizers.  The mac and cheese which is really good. The rest, a bacon wrapped shrimp, crab dip, and catfish were very mediocre and not what you would expect from a place wanting to be a higher end restaurant. Tonight, we sat down and were directed to the Paella special for 2 from the manager who was very nice and described the dish as amazing. I believe it was $40 or around there. It was horrible. Gordon Ramsay phrases ran through my head immediately ""this looks like a dogs dinner"" and ""That's shocking"". Breaking it down- The rice was crunchy but not because it had been charred on top but because the rice wasn't cooked through in the middle. There was way too much excess liquid at the bottom of the pan. I would have expected the bottom to be charred and crispy from the pan and proper cooking but it looked liked lemon rice soup. The seafood in the dish was very dry and overcooked. Instead of layering in seafood based on thickness and type, it appeared to have been mixed in from the start. Shrimp-rock hard, salmon (what the XXXX is salmon doing in there) very dry and unseasoned. There were thin slices of zucchini and carrots through the dish....why?????? The bartender asked if we wanted a bag and a quick ""NO""came out.  She said that maybe we should give it to a homeless person and my response was "" If there are some you don't like go ahead.""I know there are many many spins on dishes in this world but the flavors didn't blend well, there was too much Saffron, and a strange variety of items I wouldn't expect to see in a standard Paella.  It was really a good example of a place trying to make something they don't know how to make. I had overheard the manager saying they were going to have three different types going forward. Suggestion!  You should get one right first before you start expanding the dish or at least taste dishes you are selling.We did not ask for a refundWe asked the server not to say anything to the manager while we were thereWe did critique the mealI did stop somewhere else to grab something after I left."
2.5 star rating,"I first ate here last year when it was Detroit Fish Market.  It since closed down, then was fairly quickly reopened under the new name.  Since the ""new"" name was so close to the old, I always had the impression that the new owners were trying to keep it much the same as the old Fish Market.   Upon finally visiting back here recently, I see that my hunch was correct.  The interior is exactly the same, as does the menu, and I am even pretty sure that my waiter was the same guy who waited on me last time.  But I digress.The food is good.  Not as awesome as I had hoped considering the prices, but it's good.  The place is beautiful and has some pretty unique booth set ups that are condusive to groups, or a romantic evening for two.  The service was awful.  My reservation (party of 2) was for 7:00.  My dining companion was running a tad late, so I checked in and informed the hostess, then sat at the bar and had a glass of wine while I waited.  The bartender was fantastic - friendly, fast, and made great chit chat about some tips for making the most of DSM's Sunday brunch.  When my friend arrived, we told the hostess we were both there.  She left and said she was going to clear our table for us.  10 minutes later, we were still waiting to be seated.  Took nearly 15 before our butts met our chairs.  Ok, things happen.  And they were busy.   But although our waiter greeted us quickly after we sat down, it took over 10 minutes for even just our waters to be brought to the table (closer to 20 for our ordered drinks).  I sat and watched while the table in front of us, who had been seated about 10 minutes after us, received a bread basket (of which our table was given none), AND received their appetizer course before we got ours as well.  This pattern of service continued all night.In the end, our meal took 2.5 hours for all 3 courses to be delivered and eaten.  Good thing I wasn't in a hurry!DSM is in a great spot and has potential for being a true contender on the Detroit fine dining front.  But they need to get their service in order first."
2 star rating,"This was my first time visiting this restaurant and I went during Detroit's Restaurant Week. I had a horrible experience due to the service and don't plan on ever going back unless I feel like crab cakes.The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice with a live piano player. This place is children friendly but the layout of the tables seems to be too close together. The service was horrible. The waitress and server did not come to our table to get us drinks until 20 minutes after we arrived. Once we placed the order, the appetizer came out about 10 minutes later. I ordered the crab cake that was supposed to have salsa on top but she notified me that that they ran out of salsa as she brought it out. Our main course took about 20 minutes before coming out and no one ever came to refill our water. When we were done with our main course, we asked the server to bring us boxes. He brought it out promptly. We already ordered dessert when we first came in so we waited another 15 minutes before the waitress came by the see what our dessert was. We then had to wait another 5-10 minutes until it came out.Throughout the night, the waitress was apologizing for the long waits and she had an excuse for everything. The table near us was very demanding, a lot of people during restaurant week, only one person that makes dessert, etc. The crab cake, despite the lack of salsa, was the best I've ever had. I would come back just for it. It came on top of some rice and had tartar sauce to accompany it.The catfish fingers were a little too salty for me.I ordered the Catfish, Belonzi, Mississippi and it was good. The fish was really tender and the breading was good. I wasn't amazing though, so if I were to come back I wouldn't order this again.My mom ordered the Shrimp Pomodoro which was also good but not amazing. The sauce was slightly spicy. My brother ordered at 14 oz. ribeye which was also good but we wouldn't come back just for it.Because of the lack of service that we received and their food, I would not come back again."
2 star rating,"Our party of seven arrived around 4, we were greeted promptly and seated on the patio. We ordered our drinks, food, etc. However, service was slacking. Our round of cocktails took 20 minutes to come out and the food maybe another 40. My party ended up going up to the bar for their own drink refills at some point. But as the other people of my party were growing antsy, I didn't really mind because I've served and understand how tricky juggling multiple tables can be. But the waitress was friendly enough and trying her best. I ordered the lobster mac, which was yummy, but pricey for serving size. Three hours later the bill came, our total was around $120 dollars. 18.5% gratuity was added as insurance for less than great service. The waitress couldn't be bothered to separate our checks, so we paid with cash and a couple of cards. Once again, we had to walk our bill up to be cashed out because our server was MIA. I signed a receipt for $15. But upon checking my bank statement, I was charged for the full $120 check. Management failed to contact me back about reimbursement nor did they seem even slightly apologetic for the whole ordeal.Overall, the whole experience was a headache and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. If I had to offer one bit of advice before dining here, expect a wait and make sure you keep your receipt."
1 star rating,"We walked in and they didn't have our reservation. No big deal because the place was empty.  We were then lead to our table, which I quickly realized after sitting down had not been wiped.  I planned on asking for a towel to wipe the table once our server arrived but the server never came!That's right, after 10 minutes of sitting around and watching server after server walk past our table and noticing 3 other servers folding napkins in plain view of our table, we left.Here's the kicker, as we were leaving the manager asked us how everything was and I said great, he responded with ""my man!""  How oblivious can someone be to what's happening in their restaurant? This place was a joke. I'd be surprised if its still open 3 months from now."
1 star rating,This experience was wonderful all around! The staff was efficient and friendly. The food was to die for! My cocktail 7th Heaven was soooooo good! The restaurant itself is gorgeous with a great vibe. Definitely this is my new spot in downtown Detroit.
5 star rating,"My very first trip to the Detroit Seafood Market was during Restaurant Week last month. We went on a Sunday afternoon, it was not crowded at all. The hostess first attempted to seat us at the very first table next to the kitchen door. No thank you. We asked to be moved. She moved us to 2 tables away from that one. Whatever. I understand sections belonging to certain waiters/waitresses at certain times, but leading someone directly to a table by the kitchen? After that, everything else went pretty smoothly. I ordered the stuffed salmon over jasmine rice. Delicious. I also had the fried calamari as an appetizer. Best calamari I've had in some time. I had the cheesecake for dessert. I wouldn't write home about it, though... it was just ordinary cheesecake. The dishes were plated elegantly, which was appeasing to the eye. Service was a bit slow... when it came down to wrapping things up, we waited (while searching out our waitress). My second trip to the DSM was a few weeks after that one. It was a rainy afternoon during Tiger Playoffs against the Rangers. My co-worker & I wanted to eat out for lunch and our other quick stops were packed due to the game, so we stopped at the DSM hoping for a quick lunch, as we only had 1 hour. There was no real lunch menu, so we each got an appetizer and split the lobster mac & cheese. I got the fried calamari since I liked it so much the last time. Again, very good. I also enjoyed the lobster mac & cheese. It was a plentiful serving and very adequate to share. It would be nice if there was a 'quick' lunch menu (with lunch pricing), though.  Since we just ordered appetizers, it didn't take *that* long, but between waiting for the food and for the waitress to come back (we made the mistake of not being ready when she first came to us), we probably spent more time there than we would have liked. When our food arrived, we asked for the bill and a carryout right away. Overall:For a party of 1 or 2, sit at the bar.For a quick lunch/meal, order appetizers.Call ahead and do a carry-out."
3 star rating,"It's Detroit Restraurant Week, and yesterday I was reminiscing about coming to Detroit Seafood Market last year. To set the stage, we're two displaced Seattleites, craving something that approximates what we grew up back west.  Nothing crazy, just a bowl of steamed clams, wood-plank salmon, maybe some fresh crab if it's fancy.  Standard Emerald city fare. Sadly, I was disappointed.  The restaurant itself is quaint, with a 1940s vibe.  The kind of place where the waiters all have starched uniforms and call people ""sir"" and ""ma'am"".  My waiter was very nice...until he never came back until we were finished.  Strike one.Bland, greasy food with a slight fishy smell.  Contrary to what you might think, fishy smell from fish is not a good thing.  Strike two.  Shockingly expensive for what we got, and this was through restaurant week.  The total bill ended up being something like $80.  Strike three.  I felt like they tried, for the most part.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  I will say that we never went back to downtown Detroit that year for food.  Coincidence?"
2 star rating,"We went to dinner here after the Auto Show Charity event. The watermelon margarita drink was awesome. We also really enjoyed the calamari appetizer a lot. It is spicy though. I had the lamb chops as my entree. I liked the flavor, but would have preferred that they be cooked more ( I ordered medium rare). We had key lime pie for dessert. It was solid but not great."
4 star rating,"I was just here last night for the start of a fun evening with my best friend. I've been to the Detroit Seafood Market before and was a little underwhelmed but I decided I would give it another shot. We arrived there around 9:00pm for a late dinner and the restaurant was bustling with many diners - a very diverse crowd. 1 point!The jazz band was great...silky voices atop smooth sax and piano. The gentleman was doing covers - I would've preferred something a bit more original but nonetheless, it lended a great mood to the restaurant. Another point. We were sat by the band and I had to shout over my menu to speak with to my friend. Not fun. I asked to be moved away from the band and the hostess told me to come and check with her in 10 minutes. While we sat, a waiter sat a basket of bread and two glasses of water at our table wordlessly and walked away, never coming back. Uh...hi, how are u? Great! Thanks? I told the hostess that we were not going to be needing the water and bread so they would not have to bus the table again. She asked me if we had ordered yet and I said no - she raised her eyebrows in suspicion. Hmmm....We were seated in another area away from the band and a much quieter area, thank goodness. The new waiter came by and took our orders quickly. I ordered the blackened salmon with a small salad and my friend, the Surf n Turf. I waited and waited and waited. No salad. He walked past me and noticed that I had not received my salad and I think a light bulb went off! Ding! He quickly returned with my salad and sat it in front of me. Happy? Wrong! The salad was missing some of the components listed on the menu...bacon (don't mess with my bacon!) and croutons. It also was limp and smothered in some creamy dressing. I sent it back and he brought another one that was correct and more aesthetically pleasing. Our entrees came rather quickly. Here comes the dismay. The salmon - perfectly cooked and tasty. The jasmine rice - more like mush. Grossly over cooked and barely formed. The vegetable medley - greasy and tasteless. The price ($24) was not justifiable for such poor quality in the side dishes. This was also my sentiment when I visited here for the first time. The waiter was not attentive - only returning to hand us the check. From reading other reviews on here, I see others had the same experience. Although I love the crowd and music at the Detroit Seafood Market, the food and service would not allow me to return. I've been twice; fool me once - shame on you, fool me twice - shame on me."
2 star rating,"I had dinner here with my boyfriend with a Groupon for an appetizer, two entrees and two glasses of wine, which was a great deal. They lost our reservation, which wasn't a big deal as it wasn't busy anyway. We were brought the wrong wine (I ordered a pinot noir and got a pinor grigio, which I like both so whatever) and also the wrong appetizer (my boyfriend ordered regular oysters and we received oysters rockafeller, which were delicious, so again, whatever). Some people might be outraged over this, but it's not too criminal in my mind. We both ordered the surf n' turf, mine with fried lobster, his with grilled so we could try both. The lobster serving was very small, and while I thought my filet was good (I am not hard to please food wise) my boyfriend wasn't a fan of his.  We got the lava cake dessert, which was very good! We asked for our bill and got someone else's so we had to flag down our waitress. Once we paid and were ready to go, I realized the dessert definitely wasn't on the bill. So I guess we got a free dessert. By then, enough had gone wrong that I felt it was deserved. Overall, the atmosphere of the restaurant was wonderful (and the live music) but the service was the reason I went with 3 stars. Had it been too busy to seat us right away and had I of cared what kind of wine/appetizer we got, it would have been kind of failure."
2.5 star rating,"This place has decent food , high prices and when I ordered the lobster it was cold and there was still some shell! At least the service was good"
3 star rating,"Cool decor + Good food + Reasonable prices.  We had:-- Crab cake: crispy and light-- Lobster mac-n-cheese: very tasty, chunks of lobster meat, a bit greasy but mac-n-cheese usually are-- DSM steam bucket: nicely seasoned, not overcooked-- Broiled Chilean sea bass: the chef rightly took a light touch with seasoning and cooking time, so the delicate sweet flavour of this fish  was highlighted.  A really nice dish.A good place to try is you are in the area and like seafood."
4 star rating,"Being a big seafood fan, I wish I could say that I was blown away by this place, but I wasn't.  Not even remotely.  Not even a slight breeze.Service was awful, and when you fall down on service you lose me immediately.  The food was ok, again nothing that impressed me but it was edible.  The restaurant seems stale, dated, maybe even slightly dirty.  Everything needs to be freshened up, including the wait staff."
2 star rating,"I just can't stop thinking about the calamari.... Not only was the food good, but our server was cheerful & friendly, the ambience lovely, the prices reasonable and the location unbeatable. We started out with a bottle of wine & the DSM [Detroit Seafood Market style] calamari- I was a little bummed at first that it didn't come with lemon or any sauce, but it didn't need it. It was crisp, flavorful & seemed to melt in your mouth. For an entree, my husband & I split the twin fried lobster tails & the lobster mac & cheese. Both were delicious, decedent & satisfying. We had the death by chocolate for dessert & it was nearly the death of me. I was SO full by this point, but the chocolate cake/mousse paired with the fruit topping was absolutely incredible. My advice - eat all you can, but make sure you have time for a long walk after!!"
5 star rating,"I wish I could say that the food at this place was good, but I will never know.  I had a 8pm reservation, showed up at 6pm fully expecting that we would have to wait around the bar area until 8pm.  No problem.  The hostess takes us over to the bar next door for us to wait.  She tells us that she will come get us as soon as they have a table available.  Excellent. After sitting at the bar for an hour and a half, I decide to check with the hostess just to see how things are progressing.  This is where things go downhill.  The hostess informs me that she has given away our table, thinking that we had left.  We had been sitting at the place at the bar that she took us to for 90 minutes.  Why would she think we had left?  She tells me that she will put us back on the list and we will be seated next.  This is at 7:40.  Instead of going back to the bar, I decide to stand near their hostess stand, so she will not forget about us again.  At 8pm, I ask her again about our situation.   She says that she is still waiting for a table (even though several people have been seated in the last 20 minutes).  At 8:20, we are still not seated, and I ask to speak to a manager.  The manager apologizes and says that she will try to seat us soon. At 8:40, we are still standing at the hostess stand with no table.  I speak to the manager again, and once again she apologizes and proceeds to blame the hostess.  At this point, I really don't care whose fault it is, I just wanted to eat.  I ask the manager to pick up our valet tab and we will be on our way.  The manager once again apologizes and requests our address so that she can send us a gift card for our trouble.  Not surprisingly, I never did receive a gift card.I will never attempt to visit this restaurant again.  The manager was nice, but incompetent, the hostess was completely rude and unprofessional.  I honestly get better service at my local McDonalds."
1 star rating,"My husband and I had brunch there this afternoon, what a waste of money $30 dollars per person for brunch very pricey meal and the food was horrible. The catfish was over salted, the greens was tough and not seasoned well at all the fried chicken was not seasoned, the ribs was not tasty at all. The women at the omelet station looked like she didn't want to be there with the four ingredients that I put in my omelette didn't help the blandness of my eggs and the carving station they say it's prime rib was nothing prime about, who cooks a prime rib well done. It was well done and tough that was the last straw, 1st time a tasted a mimosa and it will be the last. The drink was not cold and refreshing at all. The only thing good was the ice water and grapes. Who ever is cooking in the kitchen needs to go back to culinary school. If you spending 30 dollars for brunch buffet it should taste like your momma put her foot in the food, not here, I only seen my waiter twice and the bus boy brought our water the rest of our visit. 2nd disappointing experience the last time was last Valentine's Day which I swore I would never come again. They got me twice it won't happen a 3rd time. And the website says you need to make reservations well my husband calls to make reservations they have home a 1:00 reservation and didn't take his name so we thinking this joint is going to be on jam because you need reservations for brunch, it was around 4 parties there eating, I see why they didn't take his name because the joint was damn near empty. Y'all need to hire a new culinary staff. If y'all serving sub par quality food like this and get away and stay in business I need to get into the restaurant business."
1 star rating,"We ate here tonight as part of Detroit Restaurant Week.  We thought everything we had was delicious and the portion sizes were very good.  The only problem was that we felt very rushed.  Our entree arrived while we were still eating our appetizer.  As we looked around we noticed that everyone else did too.  Across the room I noticed another table receiving their desserts while they were still eating their entree.  We were probably eating faster subconsciously, because we had already finished our entree when our desserts arrived.  Then of course just after we received our dessert our bill was placed on the table as our server was running to another table.  Maybe they were trying to turn tables over as fast as possible to accommodate everyone but it was a bit ridiculous.We split the lobster mac and cheese to start in addition to our Restaurant Week appetizer.  I highly recommend it!!"
3 star rating,"I was looking for some healthy food Sunday midday and since this was next to my hotel, I thought I'd try. I booked a table. It was $30 buffet. Fine. But the food selection was terrible. There was an omelet station, fine. The chafing dishes had ONE fish (seafood restaurant?) dish. There was virtually nothing healthy save a wilted salad (wilted from sitting). There were spaghetti and meat balls, mac and cheese and every other high fat, cheap food. Desserts were small and seemed out of a box. So for $38 (that includes tip) I had six cubes of melon, a wilted salad, 1/2 a waffle and then I fled eager to find a place that had salmon, chicken, healthy options. Heart attack haven."
1 star rating,"Their happy hour is fantastic, half off drinks and appetizers. . I went yesterday and still had work to do so I called ahead to see if they had Wi-Fi ( they do) I brought my laptop along. The staff are very courteous and accommodating, they gave me a nice table where I could do my work comfortably and was offered a drink on the house! I'll definitely be back, it was a great experience to top off my busy day."
5 star rating,"Terrible, SLOW service.  We had theatre tickets but arrived with plenty of time to spare.  It took so long to get drinks, then food that we were rushing to eat our food in 15 minutes so we could make our show time.  They did comp our drinks and the food was good when it finally arrived but the overall experience was bad."
2.5 star rating,"I went with a group for Sunday brunch...it was $25 and came with two mimosas. Those were delicious. There was a live musician who was really singing some tunes. He had a sound similar to Randy Newman from the toy story movies. The buffet was like a soulfood buffet..omelette and waffle station, carved meat (that was very tasty), salad-like table, eggs, meat, potatoes (also very good), then there was some lunch items...fried chicken wings, porkchops, broiled fish...All of the lunch items were just ok and nothing spectacular. The desserts were off hiding on top of the bar and were never replenished like a buffet is supposed to do. I had to ask the waitress what kind of desserts there were, but once I found out she was happy to bring me a piece. We got there just as they were opening, so there was no wait, but as soon as 12:30 hit...the lobby was crowded and soon there was a line full of church folk...so I do recommend going before 12pm if you want a quiet, no wait brunch experience. Not really sure I would go back anytime soon, still looking for that brunch spot that I just can't get enough of...haven't found it yet...."
3 star rating,"Terrible experience , staff seemed confused and unorganized. We were asked by 6, yes 6, different people what our drink order was and didn't get drinks for 30 min after arriving. The food was mediocre and again took 30 minutes to arrive and after dessert was ordered ( it was a birthday) we almost left it took so long . We were there 3 hours and would never go back. There are much better options for much better fish in the surrounding areas."
2 star rating,"If I could give this place a negative rating, I absolutely would. I have never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant before.My boyfriend and I went here for my birthday on Saturday night. When we walked in there was no hostess...she ended up walking in with sunglasses and her purse after us, as if she was just showing up. Weird, but not that big of a deal. We were seated and ordered drinks and an appetizer. We then ordered a paella. The menu requests that customers allow 20 minutes for the paella to be prepared. Not a problem. We got there a little before 5:30 pm and the restaurant was not busy at all. By 6:20 we still had not received our paella. However, THREE other tables that sat down well after us did receive their meals. We had to be the Red Wings game by 7:00. We asked the manager about our food and we were told about three times it would be out shortly. We didn't get our food until 6:45 and when we did, it had zero flavor. I should also mention while we were waiting for our food we ordered 2 glasses of wine that took 25 minutes to receive. The manager offered us a free dessert to compensate for the absurd wait but we had 15 minutes to shovel back the food and make it to the hockey game so we said we didn't have time and declined the dessert but they made no other attempt to compensate us. They even charged us for $2 bread. Seriously??? But wait, it gets better! As I mentioned, it was my birthday and my boyfriend gave me a birthday card which had the Red Wings tickets in it. We were in such a hurry to leave that I left it on the table and didn't realize until we had already paid for parking at the game. I called the restaurant and told them I left my card and was put on hold for 15 minutes while they ""looked for it"". The person comes back on the phone and says there is no card on the table. Like are you kidding me? You make us pay for shitty food that took over an hour and then throw out my birthday card that had hockey tickets in it? I will NEVER in my life return to this god awful place. And I strongly suggest everyone else stay away!!!!"
1 star rating,"Went here after the Lions destroyed the Chiefs looking for a good meal to wash away the memories of the concessions at Ford Field.The highlight of the meal was the Lobster Mac & Cheese. Like others here have stated, this is an Excellent appetizer.Too bad the rest of the meal was very very sub par.My filet was rather mealy, the mashed potatoes had to be from an army mess hall. No seasoning, and the texture is what I remember making at Ft. Jackson back in basic training.My wife had the perch dinner. The perch was overcooked, the rice undercooked. All in all the service was rather slow considering that there were only 4 other tables seated at the same time as us.If you are looking for an appetizer and a drink, then by all means stop in and get the Lobster & Mac. It almost makes the rest of the experience worth the hassle."
2 star rating,"We dined here Feb 7, 2017 during Detroit Restaurant Week and the experience was terrible!  It was my friend's first time and I hadn't been there in a few years.  I recall the service being slow in the past, but at least the food was good.  Well, my recent visit not only included slow (yet friendly) service, but the food was less than desirable.  I ordered mussels (they were ok), fisherman's stew (it was ok), and peach cobbler (the cobbler was colder than the ice cream that was on top).  My friend ordered salmon which came with mashed potatoes...the food was   bland and so cold that it tasted like it came directly out of the refrigerator.  It was so bad that I felt embarrassed for the restaurant.  No more visits for me!"
1 star rating,"On April first we plan a suprise birthday party for my sister who is battling cancer. The managers at Seafood market was absoutely horrible. We had to wait almost three hours to be seated. After having reservations for eight o'clock. Discrimination till exist among our own people. Because if we had been a group of white folks waiting, they would not been treated with the disrespect that we was subjected too. The service was horrendous, it was truly disheartened to my sister to be treated so horrible. Never never will i go or encourage any to patronize the Seafood Market."
1 star rating,"Ordered my food to go at 7. Got an email shortly after that said order will be done at 7:19. Showed up around that time and was told ""not quite done yet"" by a bartender. Sat and waited until 750 to get my food. The reviews on here are very accurate when talking about being ""slow."" Won't waste my time by coming back/ ordering from them again."
1 star rating,"Nice romantic atmosphere. Went here just before a show at the Detroit Opera House which is just a walking distance away. Was kind of hesitant at first because of the reviews about the service but we had an excellent waitstaff, very attentive and prompt. I never had an empty water glass or wine glass.The crabcake appetizer was delicious, wish there was more than just one. Salad portions were of a generous amount and very fresh. The husband and I split the catfish and the lobster tail,  reasonably priced.  The catfish was lightly dreaded and well seasoned. By the end of it all, we were both too stuffed to get dessert."
4 star rating,"Had 5:45 pm reservations, thinking we'd safely make it to Ford Field by 8 pm for the U2 concert. We arrived at 5:45. At 6, we were told we just had to wait for a table to be cleared.  We watched the table as it sat dirty. One busboy walked over to the table, then walked away. A second finally came by and started clearing, before the first came back and they started talking. At 6:10, we were seated at a different table. Understandably, on a busy night, service was slow, but it turned out to be atrocious.  We ordered the first time the waitress came to the table, at 6:20.  Then we waited.  She mixed up our drink order, switching them with a nearby table. Then we waited some more. And the clock ticked. The waitress kept assuring us our food was coming. We saw a couple who was behind us in line finish their meal. Then others. Then the place started to empty. And no food.  Finally, at 7:45, we left and grabbed a hot dog from a nearby street vender.  Bread was good."
1 star rating,"Given the cozy atmosphere and inviting bar, I want to like this place.  After last night's experience, I doubt that will happen.  The service was so slow, it was almost non-existent.  The martinis were served in small glasses that were about 1/2 full (for $7.50?!).  One friend ordered scotch on the rocks and was charged an extra dollar for the rocks.  What?  Hubby's chopped salad was good; my caesar was gloppy and pretty awful.  Our dinners ranged from pretty decent perch piccata to tough scallps.  The final funny thing was asking to have $66 on one credit card and the rest of the bill on the other.  So one card got $55 and the rest on the other.  It wasn't worth asking for a correction."
2.5 star rating,"My best friend was visiting me from France and so a group of my friends suggested we take him to this restaurant for his last night. When we arrived, we were seated and we were poured glasses of water. After about ten minutes, no one came to wait on our table. A friend of mine then asked the nearest employee if we could order drinks. Finally, a waiter, Van, arrives. He apologized for the delay and the fact that no one communicated that our table had no server. Van was fantastic and that is the only positive thing about my experience here.My best friend ordered the colossal shrimp, while I ordered the crab, artichoke and spinach dip. Another friend ordered the boom boom shrimp. It took about 20 minutes for the food to come. During this time, we decided to order our main courses. When the colossal shrimp arrived, they were anything, but colossal. The shrimp were barely jumbo, but my friend expressed what was colossal were the ice cubes. The other appetizers were fine. My friend complained to Van and he told us that it is more so what the kitchen considers colossal. Already from a legal standpoint, this is false advertising.After we finally got our main courses, which took a very long time, things took a turn. I ordered the stuffed salmon (crab and shrimp). My friend ordered the Maryland style crab cakes. My salmon had no shrimp whatsoever, cold mashed potatoes and the veggies were overcooked. The Maryland style crab cakes were completely disrespectful to Maryland where I was born and to be fair I forewarned my friend that you don't order that type of dish unless in the state. This was not lump crabmeat and resembled more of a salmon cake in my opinion. I asked for a menu to verify what the salmon should be stuffed with and that same server disappeared and then finally a manager came instead. I asked him for a menu. At this point, I verified the contents and expressed dissatisfaction. He tells me that the shrimp is diced and cannot be seen. The crab inside the salmon was the same as the crab for the crab cakes. I expressed that my food was cold and I was confused as to why they also said the shrimp was colossal on behalf of my friend. He said well already we see that the shrimp is chopped in the crab to which I replied, but you just said it cannot be seen. He ignored me and offered a new side of mashed potatoes. He never answered about the shrimp or my best friend's appetizer. My friend wanted a percentage off of the bill, but I insisted not to get anything taken off of the bill as many people complain just to get discounts. The manager said they don't reduce bills. He later brought a new side of mashed potatoes which were clearly reheated. My friends and I did not finish our meals. My best friend ordered a salmon salad, which was a bit sugary he said. My other friend ordered a seafood pasta, which she described as being just ok.Van, our waiter, came out to apologize for our experience as he was not involved in any of this. We spoke with him to explain everything and he was clearly disappointed that our experience was much less than satisfactory. We stayed a bit longer chatting with him before paying our bills, but we were sure to tip him as he was a real class act and we felt welcomed with him.As I explained to Van, the attitude starts with management. We were mishandled from arrival. I simply asked for a menu and instead I got the manager without asking. The manager took absolutely no responsibility and did not seek resolution - for example, an opportunity to order a new dish or even stuff the salmon as it was advertised. Again, this is false advertising. Instead, we felt that he wanted confrontation.In short, do not go here."
1 star rating,"A week later, same great meal, same server, slowest service I've had in a long time. I'm not sure if the kitchen was slow or if they tried to keep us waiting so we ate less of the AYCE crab legs, but the experience was regrettable. We inquired about 30 minutes or more into waiting for our entrees and requested refills occasionally. The crab was still delicious. I had the shrimp bisque and tiramisu this time which were both great. The good is top notch, but the service just fell off a bit from my first visit, and consistency is key. I have two groupons to use here on normal menu items so I can put the AYCE Wednesday behind and update again."
4 star rating,"The food God's were smiling down upon me last night my friends. After an attempt to try Slows BBQ for the first time last night was foiled by an hour and fifteen minute wait, my friend and I recalled some recently purchased Groupons for DSM we both had. The place was wide open so obviously the word has not gotten out about ""All You Can Eat Crab Leg Wednesdays."" The offer was so good my friend and I elected to bypass dining for next to nothing by ordering off the menu, to try out the All You Can Eat deal (no coupons or other discounts included). Let me just take a second to blow your mind...for $24 you get the following: Choice of Coffee or a Soft Drink Choice of Appetizer (House or Caesar Salad, Shrimp Bisque, or New Orleans Gumbo) Fresh Crab Legs (8 very nice sized legs with two exceptional claws) served with lemon, butter, red potatoes and a small piece of corn on the cob). Dessert (Last night was NY Cheesecake, Bread Pudding, Apple Strudel, and Triple Chocolate cake to name a few, there were 6 options total) Now just doing some conservative math let's see how good of a deal we are really getting... Drink - $2? Soup/Salad - $5? Dessert - $6? So already we are at $13 not including the entree, not bad. That leaves $11 for a plate of crab legs, which is a deal in itself. Since my feeling is that ""All You Can Eat"" creates an obligation to order AT LEAST seconds, I went with a second plate. The total was easily 2.5-3.5 lbs. All of the above for $24 is just an incredible deal. But, I guess it wouldn't be that solid of a deal if the food all sucked, tasted bad, were tiny portions or the service was awful. However, everything I had was solid. The gumbo was dark but flavorful, Not the appearance I'm used to but it tasted great. Like I said earlier the crab legs were surprisingly big (I think for an AYCE deal you sometimes expect smaller servings). The bread was good, the service from the host to the waiter was also good. The cheesecake was delicious and was raspberry which is a favorite of mine. Although I can't speak to anything off the daily menu, DSM at least gave me plenty of reason to visit them again. This will not be the last Wednesday I drop in on them for some crab or on a weekend to spend my Groupons."
5 star rating,"I've eaten here a couple of times with friends and have been pleased with everything.Service is very attentive, the decor is nice, it doesn't get too loud, and the food is not only fantastic, but VERY reasonably priced for what you get.The chopped house salad is fantastic, as is the calamari appetizer.  My dining companions have always been happy with their meals as well.  I wasn't too impressed with the creamed spinach, however.I wish they validated parking, as it can get expensive, especially if you are there on a game night."
4 star rating,"The crab cake appetizer was excellent.The pan fried tilapia was good, but  had a little too much breading. One of our group had shrimp and pasta and said it was excellent. The deserts were also excellent.Service was good even though the place was very busy."
4 star rating,"Went there for lunch with 3 co-workers.  3 out of 4 us ordered the white fish picatta and we agreed that it was pretty good.  The famous lobster mac n'cheese was good but it was cold in parts.The host was not friendly.The waiter was okay but everything took FOREVER.We sat down and said we were really hungry and would love some bread, anything to just tie us over.  20 minutes later the bread arrives.From there another 20 minutes for the food.We were there for 2 hours. I feel like I aged 10 years waiting.  Worst part, they weren't busy and there were no apologies. I'd go back for the food but they really need to do something about the service and wait."
3 star rating,"We ate at Detroit Seafood Market tonight, and don't have much good to say about it. The decor was nice, the menu looked good. The food and service did not meet expectations. We had the mussels for an appetizer, and I had blackened scallops and my partner had the steamer bucket. In general, the seafood did not taste fresh. It didn't seem to be very high quality. It was all overcooked. The servers were friendly enough, but started ignoring us before our food even came out. The meal took a long time, and we barely saw the server. We requested more bread, and it never came. I requested a diet coke refill, and it never came! Being ignored took some of the fun out of it. Not an entirely miserable experience, but we will not be back."
2 star rating,"I see there are a lot of mixed reviews on this place.  Here is my take:I was VERY disappointed.  To sum it up, it came across as a place that was 'trying' to be fancier than it actually is.  For an app we had a crab cake and calamari.  Both of those were pretty descent.  As for entrees go, they fell way short.  My wife had the chicken marsala. She is a chicken marsala connoisseur.. She gets that everywhere we go.  First off, they had tomato sauce in it, so, either they didn't know how to make it, or the menu is mislabeled.  The chicken was not very good quality.. Looked like some crappy leftover chinese food chicken w/ some sauce dumped on it.. It was stringy and chewy... Not good.  The garlic mashed potatoes had barely any garlic in them.. It was almost undetectable.  I had the Ahi Tuna. way overcooked.  I guess I am partially to blame because I didn't tell her how I wanted it cooked, but when she didn't ask, I ASSUMED it would come rare... However, it was not.. It was tasty, but, would have liked it just seared... Also had the no-garlic mashed potatoes...  So, after a disappointing dinner, it takes us forever to get the check, there is an error on the check, which takes another 10 minutes to get fixed, which made things even worse... So, slow/poor service, over priced/over rated food, go somewhere else.  I would give it 1 start, but the crab cake earned it 2 stars."
2 star rating,"Brought my staff party of 20 planned for months got there after play and nothing ready, then 1 waiter for a 20 top and he had 4 other tables ! Needless to say service was awful . Mashed Potatoes came like they were made from 3 day old paper and paste . Lamb chops over cooked for 3 people creme bru le cold just non stop poor food and poor service . We talked to manager and all he said some staff didn't show and bla bla bla This is a higher price point and the service and food certainly doesn't represent ! My recommendations go to Greek town !"
1 star rating,Food was very delicious and service was alright. Went for a birthday with sister but been here few times before. Food was just as delicious as I remember. Calamari is scrumptious.
4 star rating,"The Detroit Seafood Market offered nice ambiance, in a good downtown location, but is not worthy of more than 2 stars.  There were 4 of us in our party and we were promptly seated for an early Sunday Dinner.  I'm going to get right to the food.The Lobster Trio:  Tiny lobster, over cooked (never before had to use a knife to cut a lobster tail) on a pound of rice.  Reminiscent of a bad Chinese restaurant.  Fried Shrimp Dinner:  $22 for 8 shrimp half the size of Walt's Favorite.  Get the picture?Stuffed Salmon:  Stove Top Stuffing with shrimp added.  Not bad but expected better.  King Crab Legs:  GoodIn summary, typically independent seafood restaurants offer you something better than your everyday chain seafood locations.  However, The Detroit Seafood Market offered nothing more than a high bill."
2.5 star rating,"This place was really a huge disappointment. I don't mind spending some money to splurge on good seafood because I'm not terribly talented at cooking it at home but even I can do better than what we got. We went for restaurant week and were excited to try some specials not on the normal menu. Maybe the normal menu is better, because the restaurant week offerings were terrible. My friend and I split the shrimp appetizer and bruscetta. Each plate had three tiny pieces. The shrimp was overcooked, rubbery, and not much flavor. I put the bruschetta toppings on it to get at least something. The bruschetta topping was good, but a little heavy on the vinegar. The ""bread"" it was on was horrid. A very dense, slightly sweet shortcake like bread. Appetizer round was a bust.The drinks we ordered were great though, even though they were very small and $10 each. I ordered the watermelon martini and my friend had the market paradise. Not really worth $10, but still the best thing we had all night.Now onto the entrees. I ordered the catfish, which was breaded well and cooked well, but the lump crab on top was flavorless except for an aftertaste of bad fishiness. I think it must have been from the knuckles? I've never had any part of a crab taste like that except the knuckles. The burre blanc sauce was OK, but not very much of it. The season vegetables that came with it were a joke. It was mostly red peppers and what I believe was fennel. A little bit of zucchini and carrots (which were great, but very little quantity). So, it was basically two pieces of fried catfish with about 1/4 cup of vegetables for $18. Not worth it. My friend ordered the ribeye, which came with the same vegetables and mashed potatoes with an overpowering onion taste. The steak looked like the same quality of meat that you'd get for a breakfast steak a coney. She ordered it medium rare and it came very well done. Our waitress didn't seem notice that neither of us ate much of our entree. The manager did ask if my friend wanted another steak, but with how thin the steak was cut (about 1/2 inch thick), I don't see how they could cook it anything but well.The chocolate torte dessert was good, but really didn't make up for the giant flop that were the first two courses. I was intrigued by the Wednesday night all you can eat crablegs, but with the quality of food we got that was supposed to be ""showcased"" for restaurant week, I doubt I'll be back."
1 star rating,"Came here for restaurant week and slightly underwhelmed. It wasn't that the food and service was bad ... the restaurant doesn't offer anything spectacular. The rolls were pretty good - light and fluffy - and replenished on command. The lobster bisque tasted like salty mushroom soup with curry in it. It definitely did not taste like lobster and there was a film of congealed soup when served at the table. One of us for the shrimp appetizer which had great tomato cream sauce. The shrimp were a good size so that was wonderful. The entrees were a lot smaller than I expected. The swordfish was pretty tasty especially with lemon squeezed over it. It was dry and one of us actually slathered it with butter from the rolls to moisten the dish. The stuffed salmon was pretty good - no carbs on the plate. There were some little shrimp and scallops stuffed in the salmon - the salmon was a bit dry and I wish there was more of the white sauce. The desserts were alright - a light fluffy cheesecake with strawberry sauce and fresh fruit. The chocolate mousse torte was light, although with too much whip cream. I appreciated the slight hint of salt in the 'torte' (more like chocolate sponge cake) which helped to balance out the sweetness. The service was great - we got refills of water pretty quickly and the waiter split our check per our request."
3 star rating,Went on Wednesday for the all you can eat crab legs.  Crab was good but the waiter we had was horrible. It was like he didn't want to be there.
3 star rating,"Let me start by saying the service here is good. Never had an issue with that. I like the fact that they have a nice variety of food on the menu. Even though I typically order the same thing every time. You can't really go wrong with oysters and seared tuna right? I've also ordered the tuna steak dinner and I HATED IT!! Cooking a tuna steak to me well done is an abomination!! Lol. They did however offer to replace it with something else but being the food snob I am I declined. Which is probably why I no longer order entrees from there.On the bright side the happy hour is awesome!!! The drinks are really good! My favorite is the Bellini! The appetizers are also very good. Besides the seared tuna and oysters the three tier tower was really good.  Over all this place is pretty cool. The atmosphere is really nice, the staff is friendly, and the drinks are good. HOWEVER, they have all you can eat snow crab legs on Wednesday for $30. Steal right?? Wrong. I love snow crab legs but they freaking suck!!! They lack flavor!! I was so disappointed with them!! Juicy yes! Flavor ZERO!! I'm pretty sure they boil them which sucks the life out of them. They should give you the option to have them steamed. Besides that I'll be back :-)"
3 star rating,"Had a business lunch here last week with 8 people including some guests from out of town. What a huge disappointment, the restaurant was freezing and half the people kept their coats on which matched the glacial service in a room  maybe 1/3 full. My fish tacos were easily the worst I have ever had and not very warm either. Overall, a bad choice for lunch, we had an hour budgeted and it took 90 mins with possible explanation."
1 star rating,"I had my birthday party @pv lounge. They promise me that my guest could get in for $10 which was a lie. After midnight they started charging people $25 at the door and by 12:30 it was $30. And by 1am it was $35....ridiculous. Also I paid in full for my party a month in advance and at the end of my party the waitress hands me a bill for $2200, after I told her I had already paid and the name of the manager I paid it to, she said she didn't know who I was talking about and had never heard of her....luckily I had my receipt with me. I will never have a party there again....shady place"
1 star rating,"For the second time this restaurant has called the night before my reservation to cancel due to a private party. I specifically asked the hostess if there would be a private party that night, due to it being the NAIAS Charity Preview,  she put me on hold to ask the manager, she said there would not be a private party and took the reservation.   When they caaled to cancel, i spoke with the manager and he informed me the restaurant was reserved since last year and there was nothing he could do. This is an impossible night to find a restaurant. This is VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!  Had they offered a gift certificate, I would have considered going back.....I will NEVER GO THERE!"
1 star rating,"Service was horrible, manager was terrible, food was terrible... This was my 2nd time here and I will not be returning. I ordered the stuffed salmon which was burnt and hard.. The lobster bisque was probably the worst lobster bisque I've ever had. The GM of dining is totally insulting our intelligence. I will never come back. No one has apologized."
1 star rating,The Sunday Brunch-Mmm Mmm good! And the jazz saxophonist-Herbie Russ-very talented-and he can sing too! We really enjoyed the experience.
4 star rating,"Took my wife out for a little meal and had a good time.  The live music was good as we watch a lady do her solo dance thing.  We made reservations but was able to get a booth after we arrived.  If a booth is desired, request it during reservation because it got a little more busy (Friday) as the night fell.   The Stuffed Atlantic Salmon is more filling than it appears on the plate and has very good flavor.  The only adjustments is a little more sauce.  My wife Honey Grilled Sea Scallops were a bit on the small side and she added more honey sauce.  The three Scallops side order is larger.  I think the difference is one is panned seared and the other grilled.  There are a couple more items I want to try however,  this is not the costliest but definitively not cheap.  Reserve this for a special outings to impress.  Groupon is a good feeler to see if you might want to try the full menu selections at a later date. Parking lot across the street."
2.5 star rating,"DSM has been OK the times that I've gone, but nothing to write home about. The service has actually been rather good when I've been there- of course it wasn't terribly busy either time.  The clam chowder was great, as were the mussels and the seared five-spice ahi tuna. The calamari was the chewy, strip kind, as opposed to the tasty tentacles and rings kind. Very disappointing. The remolade sauce that accompanied it however, outstanding! The bacon-wrapped shrimp looked like a great idea on paper, but in reality were a little dry and chewy.As for the surf and turf, the steak was cooked just as I ordered it, but the lobster tail was really, really small. Think like, 2 bites of lobster. The garlic potatoes tasted like they came from a box, a the vegetables were marginal at best.My inner seafood nut was admittedly a bit disappointed for what I paid and what I actually received. I'd like to go back and sample a few of the other selections on the menu, just because I feel like I missed what the fuss was all about."
3 star rating,"Right on the edge of Harmonie Park. This is the perfect power lunch/power dinner place...I've taken meetings here. It's nice, airy and the food is worth having. Food wise, during lunch a cup of gumbo and the shrimp quesadillas or catfish po-boy will have you satisfied...  Good stuff!I have to reiterate about the gumbo.. So tasty!"
4 star rating,"I can echo many of the reviews below. This was by far my strangest dining experience. We had a reservation, and we were quickly seated. So far, so good. We waited for thirty minutes, and no one came to take our drink order. Wait staff kept walking by us. The manager kept walking by us. We requested a waiter, and another ten minutes passed. We really weren't sure what to do. It was just an awkward situation. So we got up and left. Clearly, there are some serious organizational issues going on as I see several other reviews detailing similar situations."
1 star rating,Love the crab legs! Their already cut in half so theirs no fighting with the shell to open! Lobster Mac is the Greatest! Live Jazz while you eat..a great way to relax and unwind while you eat such great dishes!!!
5 star rating,"Overall (2.5 Stars), check it out if you haven't been there.  It's not the greatest place in the world, but the atmosphere and fellow restaurant goers may make it worth your time.I've been to the Seafood Market twice since moving to the Detroit area in early 2012.  I can say that the restaurant has been consistent in what I've experienced.  To begin with, their drinks, specifically their specialty martinis, were actually pretty good.  The bar tenders were not bad either but could get overwhelmed with the crowd when it picked up.  Unfortunately, the bar ran out of certain liquors and specific ingredients for their drinks each time I visited.  I was surprised that a spot that actually looked this well put together could do that. As just mentioned, the atmosphere was very nice.  The restaurant had a professional look, and it seemed to bring in an attractive crowd.  Murphy's law was in effect when I visited because the evening's special events, as advertised on their website, was changed due to unknown reasons.  I was disappointed, but oh well.  I have had a variety of their appetizers and can't say any of them were really that good.  The prices were a little high in comparison to the quality of the food.  I say this because I've lived in Seattle, Austin, Newport News, St Louis, Nashville, and now here.  The overall experience was lack luster compared to truly nice seafood restaurants priced along the same lines elsewhere.  If I could give a half star I would, but since I can't, I have to lean more toward 2 stars than 3.  With that being said, I may try eating something there one more time.   If I don't go to eat, I can see myself swinging through for a happy hour drink or two...as long as they have what's needed for my drinks."
2 star rating,"This place was really a huge disappointment. I don't mind spending some money to splurge on good seafood because I'm not terribly talented at cooking it at home but even I can do better than what we got. We went for restaurant week and were excited to try some specials not on the normal menu. Maybe the normal menu is better, because the restaurant week offerings were terrible. My friend and I split the shrimp appetizer and bruscetta. Each plate had three tiny pieces. The shrimp was overcooked, rubbery, and not much flavor. I put the bruschetta toppings on it to get at least something. The bruschetta topping was good, but a little heavy on the vinegar. The ""bread"" it was on was horrid. A very dense, slightly sweet shortcake like bread. Appetizer round was a bust.The drinks we ordered were great though, even though they were very small and $10 each. I ordered the watermelon martini and my friend had the market paradise. Not really worth $10, but still the best thing we had all night.Now onto the entrees. I ordered the catfish, which was breaded well and cooked well, but the lump crab on top was flavorless except for an aftertaste of bad fishiness. I think it must have been from the knuckles? I've never had any part of a crab taste like that except the knuckles. The burre blanc sauce was OK, but not very much of it. The season vegetables that came with it were a joke. It was mostly red peppers and what I believe was fennel. A little bit of zucchini and carrots (which were great, but very little quantity). So, it was basically two pieces of fried catfish with about 1/4 cup of vegetables for $18. Not worth it. My friend ordered the ribeye, which came with the same vegetables and mashed potatoes with an overpowering onion taste. The steak looked like the same quality of meat that you'd get for a breakfast steak a coney. She ordered it medium rare and it came very well done. Our waitress didn't seem notice that neither of us ate much of our entree. The manager did ask if my friend wanted another steak, but with how thin the steak was cut (about 1/2 inch thick), I don't see how they could cook it anything but well.The chocolate torte dessert was good, but really didn't make up for the giant flop that were the first two courses. I was intrigued by the Wednesday night all you can eat crablegs, but with the quality of food we got that was supposed to be ""showcased"" for restaurant week, I doubt I'll be back."
1 star rating,"We arrived at 11:30, it was almost 1 before we left.   There were only 3 other couples in the restaurant.  We ordered sea food gumbo. The gumbo did not look fresh. The flavor seemed understated. I ordered shrimp po boy.   The bun was burnt, dry, and 4 shrimps were laid across very limp, old spring lettuce. My husband ordered the chicken Alfredo..... The seasoning was too much for a man who likes pepper on everything.  We are joining the group that will not return. If we could we would give 2 stars..PS. If you use Groupon,  be aware that there is a Groupon menu....."
3 star rating,"Detroit Seafood Market- never even realized where you were but now I'm glad I know where you are :)  Came here for restaurant week with friends. The service was great. We had initially made reservations for the wrong day but the hostess still got us in on a busy Sunday. We got the crab cakes and the thai chicken skewers. They were delicious- not greasy and had good flavor. Our server suggested the stuffed salmon, which was really good. The salmon was stuffed with all types of seafood and served on a bed steamed veggies. My friend and I thought it was a great choice and were happy with our food. I would go back to this place again to try some of the other choices- especially the lobster mac and cheese :)"
4 star rating,"Here is the skinny on DSM: It was good. Not stellar, not fantastic, and certainly not a 5 star place. Four of us went for dinner to celebrate a birthday. We mentioned it on the phone for reservations, yet they did or said nothing about it. Three of us ordered the Delmonico steak. While the other two steaks looked great, mine was just way to fatty for my taste. The Thai chicken apps were and are fantastic. I have to admit that it is difficult to rave about a location just because the food was good and the service was at an expected level. That is exactly what DSM is: good food with acceptable service. Nothing to really rave about.One suggestion to them: When providing the sugar packets for iced tea you should make sure that there are not food remnants stuck to the packets. A little attention to detail goes a long way."
3 star rating,"This was not a great first time experience. We had a reservation for a graduation party and showed a little bit early. They did not seat us until more people showed, which we did not mind. The waiter greeted us and told us immediately what was not available on the menu. He then explained he would take appetizer orders first. After we waited a while for drinks and appetizers we were still having a pretty ok time. Even though this is a sea food place we did tell him two people in our party was allergic to sea food ( something they had already mentioned to him when they got there). He stated he just thought they didn't like it and took back the chicken that was fried in the oil with the fish. We then waited over an hour for our food and after asking they had an attitude and stated we do have to cook it. We then waited another 30 minutes we talked to the manager who dismissed us. when we had waited another 20 minutes we spoke with the manager again who again did nothing. We finally got our food which most was not the correct order. Half of our party did not eat because they sent their food back and did not want to wait another hour.The people who did eat had cold food that was not worth the price. This was not the experience we wanted for a joyful occasion. The best thing here were the drinks. Good thing we brought a cake."
2.5 star rating,Wonderful sea bass with truffle sauce. Delmonico steak was melt in your mouth. Good wine and great service. Absolutely worth a trip!
5 star rating,Went on Wednesday for the all you can eat crab legs.  Crab was good but the waiter we had was horrible. It was like he didn't want to be there.
3 star rating,Service was extremely slow . Waiter was checking his Facebook . Food was so so .. I was hoping for a better experience .
1 star rating,"This place is great. It has a really nice ambiance and if you stop by on Monday nights this amazing musician Herby plays live music. The we had food was very good but definetly on the pricey side - crab cakes, lobster bisque, and house made peach cobbler. I would pass on the calamari though. The staff was friendly and attentive as well. There is a lot directly across the street from the place that ran $5. Side note: in the men's bathroom the bamboo slates are bent / missing in spots. It's just kind of weird that a place so well out together has a bsthroom in such bad shape. No impact on a great dining experience though!"
4 star rating,"The atmosphere was awesome, and the food outstanding.  I had bacon wrapped scallops and there were a generous amount and they were really great.  It came with rice and really nice fresh squash, carrots and zucchini.  My husband has stuffed shrimp which was great too.   The best part though was the dessert.  Their pastry chef is amazing!  The chocolate dessert was soooo good and the peach cobbler ala mode was out of this world.  Really enjoyed it.  Service was ok, but the food, live music and overall appeal made this an awesome night."
5 star rating,"First time visitor...Detroit restaurant week got me here.  Hubby and I loved the ambience--very romantic--high backed booths are great. Service was outstanding--I think the restaurant really took some of these yelp reviews to heart...no less than 2 people came over after we were seated and had our drink order taken to make sure someone had been over...that's fine with me, rather be overserviced than under!Food was wonderful...my whitefish piccatta wasn't the best I'd ever had, wasn't the worst either.  But hubby's salmon was delicious--delicate, flaky and the sauce didn't overpower.  The bruschetta was great, shrimp appetizer was pretty good.  The chocolate lava cake...oh, now that was fantastic.  Like a little extra rich fudgey brownie with a gooey center.  Yum.  All in all, a fantastic deal, but we'll be back with or without restaurant prices."
4 star rating,"Had a business lunch here last week with 8 people including some guests from out of town. What a huge disappointment, the restaurant was freezing and half the people kept their coats on which matched the glacial service in a room  maybe 1/3 full. My fish tacos were easily the worst I have ever had and not very warm either. Overall, a bad choice for lunch, we had an hour budgeted and it took 90 mins with possible explanation."
1 star rating,"Ate here at 7:30 pm on a Saturday night. Was expecting middling food and service based on the Yelp reviews but At the end, I and my party were pleasantly surprised. The service, especially by our knowledgeable female waiter was incredibly attentive, the food was quite tasty and not dumbed down in that oh-so-common Midwestern fashion, and the atmosphere was quite nice. There was a great jazz trio playing during dinner.The crowd was mostly nicely dressed, with quite a few couples on dinner dates and a few birthday parties. After dinner, we were quite puzzled by the negative Yelp reviews. The food here isn't going to be a revelation of seafood culinary innovation, but it's definitely worthy of the special people in your life for a pleasant night out in downtown Detroit. One suggestion for them would be: turn down the lights at dinner. It was way too bright in the restaurant that night that it felt like an unromantic lunch service. I would dine here again."
4 star rating,We had the best dining experience that we've had in a long time! And that includes all the eatery's that we frequent around Grosse Pointe!The food was absoluely exceptional!  I recommend Kenny's Favorite or the Detroit Lobster tails.  And my waiter was better than the best at Lely's!We loved the music and the ambiance. A hidden gem!
5 star rating,We came here for our anniversary dinner.  Early Saturday evening.  The place was only half full.  Nobody bothered to ask us for the reservation made.  There were several very loud groups dining.  VERY LOUD.  The place is fairly nice but looks sorely lacking on maintenance and general cleanliness.  Junk in the corners and hallway near the restrooms.  The floors were filthy.  Our server was ok but not great.  We were disappointed to see a table placard that told us drinks were half off- however the server told us that is only in the bar (30 ft away and its an open space restaurant) so that was a little ridiculous.  So from these perspectives we were disappointed.  But our dinners were terrific!  We both had stuffed salmon and we also had the lobster mac.  The lobster mac had HUGE pieces of lobster and was creamy good.  We ended up getting that as an appetizer after the app the waiter recommended (calamari) was discovered to be out of stock.  Our impression is they lack proper management of the dining room and presentation.  For the money they could be doing a lot better in these areas.  Luckily the food was the hero so we would go back but its not top of our list.  They also gave us piece of cheesecake for our special day which was a nice gesture.
2.5 star rating,"We decided to try this place for DRW.  We were neither blown away nor disappointed.  The actual location near Harmony Park is nice and the interior vibe is pretty darn good.  We were lucky to get a booth and had high expectations.  The lobster bisque and it was pretty good.  My stuffed salmon was decent.  It was dry and a tad overcooked but good.  The dessert was fantastic (chocolate mousse).  Service was good, not great.  We will probably go back for the Monday specials which seem good.  Lastly, I hate to sound picky but the mens restroom was pretty nasty.  After dropping $100 on dinner/drinks for 2 I was hoping for something nicer and it's such a simple fix to clean the walls and accessories."
3 star rating,"Service was horrible, manager was terrible, food was terrible... This was my 2nd time here and I will not be returning. I ordered the stuffed salmon which was burnt and hard.. The lobster bisque was probably the worst lobster bisque I've ever had. The GM of dining is totally insulting our intelligence. I will never come back. No one has apologized."
1 star rating,"On August 12, 2018 my wife and I went to Detroit Seafood Market and had dinner before seeing Wicked at the Detroit Opera House. My wife had the stuff Salmon and I had the grilled pork chops. We thought that this was one of the best meals we had ever had. So we decided to make reservation for August 28, 2018 for our 25th Wedding Anniversary, well in a two week period it went from one the best meals we have ever had to one of the absolute worst! They were extremely understaffed, it took 10 minutes just to get water and another 15 minutes to receive a drink. Salad and dinner rolls took another 10-15 minutes to receive. We could tell the wait staff was very stressed as one of the male waiters throw things and swore several times on the floor. Our waitress was pleasant, but overwhelmed, same waitress we had on 8/12/18. We order the same meal we had on 8/12, when we received the food, my wife's Salmon was mostly raw and the vegetables and rice were cold, my grilled pork chop was not grilled (no grill marks any where), but had been fried! It was dry and burnt on the meat's surface and like shoe leather and again all the vegetables were cold. We waited another 10 minutes before our waitress came back to check on us and showed her the plates of food, she said she would get manager, which took another 10 minutes before manager showed up. The manager was apologetic and offered to remake meals herself, but it would take another 15-20 minutes. At that time we had had enough and our 25th Wedding Anniversary dinner had already been ruined. We told manager that we just wanted to leave, which we did. Not sure how this restaurant went so Bad, so Quickly!!!"
1 star rating,"In the beginning the happy hour was great but the service has went down the hill, drink only please watch them make it I observed waitress make a couple of drinks and she stuck her hand in the cherry container after handling money etc food is hit or mis 2 star."
2 star rating,"Friendly staff- but the service is extremely slow, quality of the food is mediocre at best and if you are lucky your order will be correct. On a side note they do carry a nice Pinot Grigio Santa Margarita that makes almost tolerable."
1 star rating,"ON POINT!   From the moment we arrived a very pleasant dining experience began.   The food, the impeccable service and the personal attention given to our table made a very nice celebration even nicer!  Our server was full of helpful suggestions and her recommendations were on point.  Thanks for a nice experience and we will be back, LORD willing!"
5 star rating,"This restaurant needs to work  harder.  We went there last night for the first time after the opera.  The place was pretty empty yet they gave us a table facing the kitchen door and the sign pointing the way to the restroom.  The waitress didn't bring a glass for my husband's beer and then needed to be reminded to get one after he asked for one.  She was friendly, but a glass for your drink when you're there for dinner is pretty basic.  The ladies room was kind of dirty - not disgusting, but it did give me pause.  The food was pretty good.  However, we are not anxious to go  back after our first mediocre experience.  Too bad because the place has potential."
2 star rating,"We came on March 29th for lunch or brunch to celebrate my sister's and my daughter's birthdays.  I really wanted to take them somewhere nice.  We had a 1pm reservation for a party of 5.   After looking at the buffet, which had empty food trays, and a lot of fried stuff, we decided to have lunch.  We waited forever for a server to come to our table and when we asked for lunch menus she said, no, only dinner menus.  Not what I was told!  Server disappeared again.  After about 1/2 hr., she came back and took our order.  Never asked if we wanted a drink.  We ordered; lobster mac and cheese - disgusting, mussels - overcooked and rubbery, salmon salad - ok, chopped salad - ok, and trout.  The trout was flavorless!  It took at least an hour to get this food on the table, and 1 1/2 hrs.  to get ""Pillsbury like"" canned rolls.  The server was nice enough, but was not attentive in the least.  It was like, if you didn't want their buffet, they were not happy to cook for you.  90% of the tables were eating the buffet.  The deserts were better than the meal.  It took close to 3 hours to have lunch at this place and not by choice.  SLOW, SLOW, SLOW.  For 170.00 we could have eaten anywhere and had much better food.  We will not being going back."
1 star rating,"Just had dinner there last night. It was boring, the food that is. A bit expensive for something you could have gotten at Red Lobster. I had the stuffed grouper and my girlfriend had the surf n turf. Again, nothing to be excited about. A basic meal at best. The staff was friendly, but forgetful. Maybe our waitress was new? The set up of the restaurant has the ability to be high end, but the food is not. From the sounds of the other reviews its a hit or miss. Give it a try with a Groupon, or On Mondays when they offer specials."
3 star rating,"We went for dinner last Friday at 7:30pm. Our table was ready for us when we walked in, I was surprised because of downtown being extremely busy for opening day. Our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu. We had the fried calamari for an appetizer. It was above average, lightly breaded and cooked well. The main courses we chose included the stuffed Atlantic Salmon, Surf and Turf, Ribeye, and the Sauteed Chilean Sea Bass. The first three dishes were very well cooked and all three people were happy. I thought the Ribeye was a little over seasoned, but a good steak overall. The Chilean Sea Bass was out of this world good! We ended up ordering another order of it. Deserts were very good as well. Great experience in downtown."
2.5 star rating,Cool place in a cool area. Good menu choices with local specialties like fresh pickerel.
4 star rating,"All the bad reviews???? While I have only been there once, it was great. The food my table of 4 had was all good. Me and the  husband were pleasantly surprised  and happy that it is just blocks from our place. He had the Florida Grouper on a bed of spinach that was insanely gorgeous to look at and large portions. I had the stuffed flounder. The food was nice and hot, like right out of the oven to our table. They do need a decent selection of some good Michigan craft beers. Never ceases to amaze me that so many restaurants miss this. Cant wait to go back."
4 star rating,"This is one of my favorite places for brunch on Sundays. From 12 p.m. to 4, there is an awesome brunch buffet that includes omelette and waffle stations, breakfast meats, hash browns, grits, catfish, mac and cheese, greens and sooooo much more. My friends and I end up spending around $30 each for brunch (that includes two free mimosas!) and the tip. Make sure to come early since meter parking is free on Sundays and no one wants to pay $5 for parking!"
5 star rating,"We went for Father's Day brunch.  First we waited at least 20 min for the hostess to acknowledge us.  Then she disappeared and a pregnant hostess came up to us while eating a piece of chicken (no big deal, because she was pregnant). She got us sat and our server came in which she never told us her name or anything.  There were two lines this day. One for the buffet and another for the fresh omlettes and waffles.  They had one chef making everything. I felt so bad for her.  The buffet was hit.  Food everywhere but in the Schafer. The good that you could get was dry and nasty. Servers were sitting down yet the buffet was disgusting with no food in it. Finally after waiting 40 min for a fresh omlette we sat down. We asked our server for more orange.  She said sure took our glasses away and refilled it with dirty glasses.  We paid the bill and walked out highly dissatisfied. We almost didn't pay. I never ever ever ever ever ever ever wrote a review on any restaurant I've ever been to.  Good or bad.  I suggest to stay away."
1 star rating,"It is with great trepidation that I have to write this review. I am a giant supporter of Detroit Restaurant week,and I love what it brings to our lovely city. I chose to attend the Seafood market last night after attending one of the pre-restaurant event activities where free appetizers and drink specials are served. That evening I had the catfish fingers, the mac and cheese, and some delicious stuffed mushrooms. I was sold, the food was delicious. Needless to say, I returned last night and the food was not anything resembling delicious. My two kids, teens had the Restaurant Week $30 dinner, while I had the surf and turf, which consisted of seared scallops which I love, the scallops were cold, not seared and the consistency was lacking, I am thinking frozen, please say it ain't so. My daughter who is a vegetarian had the pasta and vegetables, they smelled and tasted like plastic. My son had the scallops as well, his were slightly better than my appetizer but were no way near how I felt they should have been prepared. Will I give Detroit Seafood Market another try? Of course I will. I am a fond believer in three strikes and you are out, so two more chances will be given, and we will see if last night was just a fluke!"
1 star rating,"Came here for all you can eat crab. Service was just ok, as was food. My plate took longer than everyone else's which was annoying, and I felt like the waiter forgot about me (10 minutes later.....) Soup was SUPER salty and cold."
2 star rating,"Service was mediocre. The waitress walked away from our table in the middle of our order at least twice. The wait was way to long for food. The place was not crowded, but the wait staff appeared to be in a state of urgency. My husband and I was ready to leave before we even received our entree. The food was not that bad, but it was nothing to ""Who Ha"" about either. I ordered grilled salmon, but they were all out. I was offered chicken, but the catch is I only eat seafood. The waitress and I had a stare off at that point. Then, I asked if I could substitute the salmon for a different type of seafood, which turned out not to not be a problem. So I settled for blacken Mahi Mahi. It was pretty good but the rice was bland. My husband ordered a shrimp scallop pasta dish, and he said it was just okay, and too spicy. The strawberry cheesecake was skimpy! I know we will not return to this supposedly upscale Resturant."
1 star rating,"Came down for lunch before a Tigers game.... WOW!! What an unexpected delight! My server, Evette, was awesome and had a smile that lit up the whole room! I started with the seafood gumbo which was quite possibly the best bowl of soup I have ever had.... EVER! I then had the mahi mahi fish tacos, and I ordered them grilled not fried and they were out of this world! No room for dessert but I guarantee I will be back!"
5 star rating,Food was great... Service could use improvement
4 star rating,"I went here on a business dinner and all of us were extremely disappointed.  The restaurant had hardy anybody in it, but the service was so slow it was ridiculous and wearing Tiger's jersey's you would think the waitress would know we had a place to go.  In addition to the food all being boring and my redfish being very very dry, this place should be ashamed of themselves with the oysters on the half shell.  They were these cheap huge no flavor things and get this, nobody in the restaurant (the server, the chef etc...), even knew where they were from.  I would not waste your money here because it's not cheap either."
1 star rating,"Could I possibly make it a 0. Don't ever use the Groupon they advertise. Suppose to be $110 worth of food for $60. When you sit down and mention Groupon they give you a whole different menu--with 4 lousy selections for the main course. Ordered the steak---was all of a 1/4 of an inch thick--a joke. All in all, was one of the worst experiences ever--not even worth the $60. Total rip off--they should be banned from Groupon."
2.5 star rating,"This was my first time at this restaurant.  We were there in the late afternoon and the place was empty.  Service was very slow.  The food was acceptable but overpriced.  For those unfamiliar with the downtown Detroit area, parking is expensive.  Most lots cost $10, flat rate.  There is metered parking if you can find a space."
2 star rating,"Almost laughable how awful this place is. 1st - There was a party of 25 and we all sat down and ordered at 8PM and we didnt get our food until 10PM 2nd - the food was absolutely awful. Almost everyone sent their food back and there was even a pregnant woman there who was starving and she still refused to eat her food. Everything was just awful. 3rd - there was 25 of us and they didnt split the bill and refused to. They were supposed to label our seats on the bill and they didnt. It took our waiter (Sallah) almost an hour to figure it out LASTLY - after the horrible situation with our bill, my amount came out to $34.72 and Sallah charged my card $344.72....... The manager didnt give me any documentation showing it was reversed until he was probably annoyed of me and finally wrote on a piece of paper and signed his name that it would be...literally all i wanted for almost an hour and it took him that long to do it. After all of this, nothing was offered to us. We werent expecting anything but what horrible customer service. I called the head manager (Crystal I believe) and she emailed documentations to me (what i asked for) and she also gave me my money back but still, the initial experience was awful. It truly shows what kind of people are running this establishment. I see your automated reviews so don't even waste your time asking me to give you another chance or any of the 25 people in our party. We're all very well connected and know bloggers around detroit who review restaraunts and will definitley make sure they don't reccomend this place to anyone."
1 star rating,Food was good but pricey. Wait staff seemed a bit uninterested and slow. The atmosphere was a nice step back in time. Don't think I'll be back.
3 star rating,"Service was excellent!  Food was great! Prices were reasonable! My girlfriends' food was a little on the cold side, she was immediately apologized to and served a new plate within ten minutes.  The experience at the Detroit Seafood Market was outstanding.  It has become one of my favorite restaurants, downtown."
4 star rating,"Restaurant week. Service was awful. I had to go to the bar next door to get a drink. Food was horrible as well, cold and no flavor. I agree with everything the other poster said. This is my first review on yelp so that will tell you how motivated I was to post this review."
1 star rating,"Extremely disappointing experience here. It took us 15 minutes to even get greeted once we sat down (after my boyfriend complained about not being greeted). The water took another 15 minutes to come. After waiting drinking water the waiter came and took our order, we then asked for a drink menu... he did not return until 15 minutes later. In this period of wait my boyfriend had to find a pitcher of water to pour for us since no one had checked on our empty glasses of water. We asked for bread 3 times and it came once our food came out. We eventually complained to a manager and once we did our food and bread finally came out.  However, after complaining the manager never came back to see how our meals were.  Waiting for drinks, bread, and our meals to come out all together for over 30 minutes is absolutely unacceptable at a restaurant like this.  You could get better service at a Coney Island.  Our food coming out was the biggest disappointment of the night. I have never been unhappier with a meal.  Terrible food terrible service.  If I could give no stars for this restaurant on this review I would.  We will never be back here."
1 star rating,"All I can say is great service, great food and strong drinks.  My son had the stuffed salmon, my wife had Chilean sea bass and I had lamb chops.  The key lime pie was phenomenal.  I highly recommend this place."
5 star rating,"We went here for Detroit restaurant week. They had a nice drink menu, a decent food menu, and a great ambiance. But, that is really all they had going for them. The service was slow, unresponsive, and forgetful. The food was bland, over salted, and lacking a depth of flavor. We ordered the avocado mango crab salad. It was about the size of a silver dollar, but literally tasted just like those three ingredients and salt. It could have used some citrus. The other app was smoked salmon chowder, but it tasted more like tomato soup with chunks of salmon. For entrees we ordered the salmon tornado and game hen. The salmon tornado was completely absent of sauce, and it is was sorely missed because the fish had no seasoning.  The hen was better, but not great. The sauce was very salty. The sides on both dishes were good, so that was a saving grace, but the proteins were lackluster. The dessert was pretty great. The blackberry cobbler and chocolate mousse cake really salvaged an otherwise forgettable meal."
3 star rating,"We had such a nice dinner...the food was really good (great Caesar Salad, Macadamia Crusted Mahi Mahi), service great.  BUT...our plates and cups were not  clean and that is a total turn off.  I want to believe it was the dishwasher gone bad and not a habit of the restaurant.  Then, I went to the bathroom.  Not really clean either and out of paper towels.  I'd go back but before I order, I'll be checking the place out."
3 star rating,"The food was good, and I hate to complain... I know waiting tables, especially big parties is difficult, but the service was kind of snippy.   I came with a group of 10 before the Lions game.  We chose this place instead of a bar because we wanted to be able to chat.   I take this same group of people out regularly and usually when we go out, we get really good service - we are (not ostentatiously so, but still...) on an expense account and we see each other infrequently, so I want it to be really nice.  First, the waiter came to our table as soon as we were seated and asked for our drink orders - we hadn't had a chance to see a menu.  He ""gives us a minute"" but returns in 10.  By then, we're ready to order the drinks AND apps.  But no.  He wants to take our drink orders, then when he returns, he'll entertain our app orders.  Okay.  Thank you, sir.  You are in charge.   When he returns with our drinks, he brings one girl her Bellini.   (for those who don't know, a Bellini is peach puree with champagne).  Her ""Bellini"" has vodka and strawberries.  No peach or champagne to be found.   My guest gently asks the server if she got the wrong drink.  He insists a Bellini has vodka and snaps at her to ""read the menu!""  No apology, no offer to change her drink, so she orders another.    When we want to order, our waiter tells us we need to wait.  When we want more drinks, no server is around.  We realize it is busy, so one from our party goes to the bar to open a tab and is shut down.  We have to wait for our server. Generally, the night continues in a similar fashion, until toward the end of the evening, when our waiter suddenly warms, apologizes for the wait for our food (which I didn't really notice - we went heavy on the apps- once they arrived, we always had food on the table).  I appreciate the change in tone and recognize that others around us are frustrated with the timing of their food.  Maybe our waiter was stressed initially when a big party came in (though it should have been expected and staffed for a big game night) and was able to settle in when more help showed up, however, as my co-worker pointed out, he definitely warmed as tip-time approached.  We all have our days and I'm glad our waiter cheered through the evening, and maybe my California demeanor is more gentle and less East Coast direct, but the drink thing and the Waiter's initial inconvenience left a bad taste in my mouth that the food, while very good, could not overcome."
2.5 star rating,"This is my 3rd time having dinner and I hate to have to state this, but things are getting worse.  First and foremost the menu prices do not match the quality of food that is served.  On Saturday I met a couple of friends for dinner, and selected the fresh catch of the day, Salmon with the burre blanc which had too much mayo in it.   The Salmon was not that of a premium cut, but rather a lower end farm raised Salmon.  my two sides, rice and mixed vegs. came out room temperature as well as the Salmon.  The rice was a spanish pilaf type, with chops of white onion throughout.   The vegs. were overcooked with excessive oil.  The only thing that was tasty was the glass of Sonoma red wine.  I complained to the server, who graciously brought me out a garden salad, which was ok..  But with the prices they charge, the excessive cost for parking in the area, I expect high quality food, not middle of the road IHOP dinners.  The resturant is never crowded so I believe they are cutting cost by buying lower end food.  I will not be returning and I informed the manager, who simply thanked me for letting her know, nothing else.  DISAPPOINTED......."
1 star rating,"A vibrant restaurant but service was poor and food not so good.  This was our third visit and every time the service was slow. I was blown away that a regular coffee was 3.25, come on!  The tuna appetizer was good but the stuffed flounder was tasteless. The ceasar salad is better at Panera. I won't be going back, gave the place 3 good trys."
2 star rating,"HORRIBLE, repeat Horrible service and marginal food. Arrived on a Saturday night at 5:05pm w/o a reservation but really wanted try the Fried Twin lobster tails so I sat at a small table towards the end if the bar area. That was my first mistake. It was like sitting at the little island in the middle of a busy intersection. Employees rushing by your takes with empty and full trays of barware, often times nudging your table with no regards. Customers going pass on either side heading to/from the restroom ... And if that wasn't enough, half way through my dining experience they had two ladies sit at a folded table not more than 3 feet from me. WHY would a restaurant put tables there for dining?Onwards ... I ordered a Caesar Salad and the Fried Twin Lobster Tails. Nothing else. No fuss, no substitutions, nice and simple, huh?Salad took a LONG time. The server actually came by and said he was checking on the status of my salad. At some point after I finished the salad the waiter came by and apologized because he had not written down the order and wanted to confirm my entree. BAD sign. At 6:25 (that's 1:20 after I sat down) my entree finally arrived. The Lobster Tails were on the small side. Was decently tasty but not something I would write home about. Veggies were soggy and overcooked. I finished my entree and sat for a while longer. The waiter finally came by and I immediately provided my credit card so I could get the hell out. Saw this restaurant on Groupon, now I know why they needed to drum up some business. BTW, the MOD (Manager on Duty) was running around like crazy (barking out orders) and never once stoped to ask how things were even though he saw me sitting there for long periods of time. My opinion ... Spend your time elsewhere. It's not the money, and when you're traveling from out of town with limited opportunities to try out the dining scene, every meal counts."
1 star rating,"Had fried lobster tail, veggies and mashed. Very very good!"
4 star rating,"My girlfriend and I came here and sat at the bar for happy hour on a Saturday night. Let me start with saying the best thing we had were the drinks...Bourbon and a white wine, both of which, the restaurant had nothing to do with other than pouring the drinks. The happy hour menu seemed pretty good, we went ahead and ordered the mussels and the buffalo shrimp. Our mistake was going ahead and ordering the seafood paella since it takes a bit longer to cook.The building itself was very was very nice, bartender was great. It ends there. Mussels tasted very old/extremely over cooked, probably to try to hide the fact that they were so old. They were awful, and we ended up leaving half of them. The buffalo shrimp were not bad, the only decent thing that we had, but I did find it a bit odd to have the shrimp with crumbled bleu cheese over the top and then serve it with ranch dressing. Oh well, if we were to ever go back, I guess I would be willing to get this again. We were both originally excited for the paella, but after eating the mussels, we both pretty much knew what we were in for. Right after the mussels were taken away we both started looking to see where to go next to eat. Good thing we did, the disappointment did not end once the paella came out. Just looking at it, it was very evident it would be on par with the appetizers. The same awful mussels were there, along with some very anemic looking shrimp scattered through out the top. There were some, what I think was, calamari. These rings were the same constancy as the mussels. What are generally rubbery and chewy, were easily cut with a fork and incredibly overcooked. There was only a piece or two of white fish, which was probably for the better since the one piece that I had was horribly fishy tasting. This dish also included what were at some point called vegetables. By the time it got to us it was very evident that these were frozen and and thrown in a microwave. It was as if they went to Kroger and bought a bag of the frozen veggies that come in the steam pouch. Tasteless mush. One of the most important parts of a paella is the rice. The rice, if it were served as a side and just advertised as a side of rice, would be ok. But to try to pass it off as rice for a paella is just wrong. The first thought that popped in my head from just looking at it was ""we are paying for Rice-a-Roni."" It tasted exactly like that.The bartender seemed to know what we were getting ourselves into as he immediately offered us some crushed red pepper on the side without us saying a single word. After managing to choke down a small serving each, we got out and went to another restaurant and had an extremely satisfying meal."
1 star rating,The food and waitstaff were fine. We would like to return only if they turn down the music volume . We had a 7pm reservation on a Monday evening and had a booth in the back of the building away from the bandstand. It was so loud we couldn't converse with the waitress so we had to point to our choices on the menu.
3 star rating,Came here for our anniversary and really enjoyed the experience. The atmosphere and the food were great. The wait staff were very attentive and the jazz band was great. The food arrived quickly. .more quick than I was expecting. My seafood Alfredo was excellent. The dish was not lacking in seafood or seasoning and was not over filled pasta. My wife was also impressed with her chicken salad. She loved the taste of the chicken and how they didn't bury the salad in dressing. The price wasn't bad either considering we had desert and a few drinks.This place was definitely on their A game on our first visit. I hope they will be again when we return.
5 star rating,"Came here with Dave S. the other day and my sentiments are exactly the same as his.What a steal the $24 AYCE Crab Legs are.  One thing I forgot to do was verify if it's a weekly Wednesday deal or monthly, etc, but damn was this delicious.The Bisque was spicy, rich, and flavorful.  I was torn between the Ceasar Salad and the Bisque.  Next time will be the salad.The crab was the star, as it should be.  I was hesitant on such a deal.  It seemed to good to be true.  When the waiter set the tray down in front of us, I was pleasantly surprised.  The crab legs were meaty and cooked perfectly.  It was served with drawn butter, redskin potatoes, and a little piece of corn.  The potatoes were good, the corn not so much, but whatever.  I wasn't there to eat multiple pieces of corn on the cob.  I went with the Bread Pudding for dessert.  I was stuffed so I only had a few bites.  It was fantastic as well.The service was great.  Pop and water were refilled constantly.  Empty shells were discarded immediately.  It was a great time.I had every intention of coming here to use a Groupon.  This was the only time I wasn't irritated by the ""rules"" restaurants place on the growing wave of online coupons.Mark this one down as a Victory!  Next time the DSM might cancel its AYCE deal after I'm done."
5 star rating,"3 stars for ambiance, friendly staff and good bartender. Location didn't seem too kosher. In the downtown area with lots of questionable characters walking the street and even entering the bar area. Dinner was good. I had BBQ Salmon with a side of Creamed Spinach. My cousin had Seafood Fettucini. We also ordered an appetizer of Seared Ahi Tuna which was pretty delicious. Kind of spicy with a side of spicy slaw served with it. My salmon was not that great because the bbq sauce was super, overly sweet! The jasmine rice was over cooked, and mushy but the creamed spinach was garlicky and good. My cousin said her Fettucini was okay but the seafood was over cooked and chewy. The waiter was a bit slow with returning to the table. We asked for a minute to look at the menu, he came back ten minutes later. He wasn't very attentive but he was okay as far as being friendly. We moved to the bar for just one drink but ended up being treated to three by a bar patron. The bartender fixed nice Gimlets, was friendly and great with recommendations. Overall, it was a nice time."
3 star rating,"On top of the many issues we encountered during our experience here, midway through our meal, my mom, dad and sister realized that the center of all of their fish was not cooked. We called the waiter over to tell them, the took the fish away and said they are going to fix it and bring it back quickly. Fifteen minutes later after asking numerous times where their meals had gone they decided it was taking too long and chose to cancel their meals. You would expect a restaurant like this to compensate some how for what had happened since our meal was pretty much ruined. Instead, all they did was take the 3 meals of the bill, leaving the rest to be paid for, doing seemingly nothing to apologize for what had happened. Needless to say I will NEVER return back her due to the tremendously POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE"
2.5 star rating,"I waited to write this review until after my ""make up"" visit.  My first attempt at trying out the new DSM was last month for their AYCE crab leg special on Wednesdays.  Multiple stars aligned that evening to culminate in a disastrous performance on their part.  I LOVED the Fish Market and wanted so much for DSM to dazzle but dazzle it did not.  The service was SO bad that I actually called the restaurant to let the manager know about my experience.  He was extremely apologetic and insisted on sending a gift card for a return visit despite my vehement protest; I know this is frowned upon in the Yelp community but hey I dropped some serious cash the first time around.Saturday night the bf and I had a hankering for some lobster and made the trek in the rain.  Once again, the service was abysmal!   I called and requested a booth with the reservation; the host stated he would note it.  When we arrived at 8:30, well past the dinner rush, there were 2 booths available but the hostess refused to seat us there as they were only for parties of 4 or more on the weekend.  Ok, I understand you need the space when you're busy but both of them remained unoccupied for the entire duration of our stay.  And what a duration it was.  There were extended wait times of ten minutes or more between being seated and meeting our server and ordering drinks and receiving them.  Our server did not deliver our food and did not check that we were satisfied with the dinners until I was almost done with my crab legs.  Service missteps I can deal with; I was a server for ten years and I know how the end of Saturday night dinner rush can be but this was beginning to chafe.  What about the food you ask?  The lobster mac n cheese is hands down the best in the city.  Slow's can suck it.  The deep fried lobster tails (drenched in melted butter of course) sent my eyes rolling back in my head.  Crab legs were of high quality and their wine menu is a solid 7.  The swordfish Mediterranean, however, was the red headed step child of the evening.  The cut of fish was incredibly tough and had not been trimmed of gristle or skin.  Typically this poses no problem as one can simply cut around it.  Unfortunately this entrée is covered in red sauce and the restaurant was dimly lit so my first bite was a rubbery mouthful of disgusting.  The bill was under a hundo for two people to gorge heartily on high end items and have cocktails so this is a draw that will bring me back despite the horrendous service.  I have resigned myself to the fact that no matter what color lipstick you put on Detroit restaurants, the grittiness just can't be polished away.  Just to add insult to injury, I still left 20% in the book at the end of the meal and our server didn't even bother to stop back by and thank us for coming in.Should you eat here?  Yes.  You will eventually get your food and it will (for the most part) outshine the fine dining joints in the suburbs.  Just don't come with any preconceived notions of service standards."
3 star rating,"Early drinks at the bar were great, but dinner after a show revealed a different atmosphere. We had to yell across the table just to be heard because the music was so loud. The staff rushed and stomped so hard my water vibrated on the table. And the clientele...oh my! I could've been in an upscale strip club. Jeans down to the knees and dresses just above the panty line were not appropriate for the money wasted on food that was okay. Only the wine saved the night. Never again."
2 star rating,"Wonderful food, great atmosphere. Great for a romantic dinner or  a night with friends."
4 star rating,"Very disappointed.  Services was painfully slow, unfriendly and lacking of quality customer service.  I just don't get it??  Great name, great location, and great opportunity to capitalize on the revitalization of Detroit.  Yet this restaurant is unorganized, confused and just not experienced.  The music was too loud, the food was mediocre, the Lobster Bisque was lukewarm, and Lobster tails were dry and undercooked.  The only conclusion is to surmise that the restaurant manager and/or owner simply lack any sense of awareness of the operation.  Candidly it's as though someone dressed up a bunch of fast-food midnight-shift employees and told them to run a higher priced dining establishment.  It's awkward and unforgiving, and in desperate need of a restaurant boot camp."
1 star rating,"Food was good, had crab cakes and date had stuffed salmon, both tasty, but service was very slow.  Dinner wine took forever to arrive, actually thought they had forgotten it.  Our server had WAY too much cologne on, really was annoying.  Large private booths are a very nice touch, and everyone was friendly.  Wanted reservations at 645, were offered 730, strange when we arrived only one other couple in the entire place!  Would try it again, but with somewhat lower expectations."
3 star rating,"Wow.  A small group of us had heard fantastic reviews so we decided to check it out on a Monday night.  Their website is great.  We finally found it, there is a parking lot directly across the street - so you can see your car - however the parking guy has sever OCD - made my husband re-park the car twice...We had made reservations, but it was really quiet on a Monday night.  We were seated promptly by a very nice hostess.  Our waiter Edward (reallllly great waiter!) greeted us promptly, gave us time to review the menu before he came back.  I would highly recommend the crab, spinach artichoke dip - the 4 of us shared.  The seafood stuffed flouder over lightly sauteed vegetables was fantastic.  I had ordered a side baked potato, but next time will skip that.  The portion was just right and the potato put me over the edge lol.   My husband had the Atlantic salmon with Michigan cherry sauce which was delicious.  We found out after he was done, he could have ordered another plank of salmon for only $7 more (the look on his face was priceless).l..so next time he will difinetly do that.  We also had the Shrimp which was perfectly done.   We finished with the berry cheesecake which was ok.... I think I'd go with something different next time.  All in all it was a wonderful dinner.  Edward was attentive, friendly, and discreet - at no time did we feel rushed or have to stop our conversation.  Our water was refilled quickly without having to ask ,which for me is a big plus.    Next time we're going to come for the happy hour m-f from 4-7 all appetizers are 1/2 off and drinks to sample a few more appetizers...... I can't understand why the restaurant wasn't full.....placed in any other city  - it would most certainly be packed.... of course thats good for us - easy in!   SPREAD THE WORD!!!!    Our dinner for 2 with an appetizer and no drinks was around $70 - but we were pleasantly full......"
5 star rating,"I came to this restaurant with my family and had a horrible experience!!!! I ordered the fried double lobster tails and received 1 & 1/2 lobster tails. After mentioning this to the waitress I was asked to provide the 1/2 lobster to the manager, Sean that he picked up with his hands and walked off with. The waitress also asked me to return an extra side of vegetables that was given for free before the lobster tail was returned. The waitress attempted to walk to the table with the fried lobster tail replacement, however, the waitress proceeded to the manager, Sean first to show him that the new lobster tail was 1/2 as the first one was. The waitress attempted to provide me with the 1/2 lobster tail and explained that she wanted Sean to witness that the new lobster tail was the first same size as the one I sent back (in Sean's hands) previously. The waitress informed me that Sean said it was okay to serve me another 1/2 lobster tail and will bring another at no charge. I declined the 1/2 lobster tail because I'm furious at this point. How do you walk someone's food across the whole restaurant for inspection and carry it back to the customer????? How unprofessional, disrespectful, and disgusting is that? After voicing my concerns with Sean I was actually charged for a meal $9 less and was never offered a substitution or any resolution. This was my second time visiting this restaurant and will never return. I definitely would not recommend anyone to dine there as the waitress and manager, Sean provided horrible customer service!!!!!"
1 star rating,"Made online reservations through Open Table three weeks in advance, no problems at all, simple set up.  We were warmly greeted at the door, and even though my party of three arrived a little before our reservation, we were seated right away and the table was already set up for us.  It was moderately busy, most tables were full (8-9 pm timeframe).I had read a few online reviews that complained about the service here, this was not the case for us.  Our waiter James was polite, quick, efficient, and provided great service.  I would recommend asking for seating in his section when available.This was the first visit for anyone in my party. We perused the wine menu which seemed reasonably priced for a restaurant like this.  The bread basket on the table had rolls which were deemed good. We started with the lobster mac and cheese which is a house specialty and rightfully so, the shrimp bisque which was deeply shrimp flavoured and very rich, and a tossed greens salad with goat cheese.For entrees we ordered the crabcakes, fried lobster, and lamb chops.  The crabcakes were good and served with a jasmine rice, a little lemon that was served with gave just the right amount of acid to cut the sweetness of the dish.  The twin fried lobster tails were good, and said to be the perfect medium for which to consume massive amounts of clarified butter.  The lamb chops were cooked skillfully, having been ordered just under medium.  Some were a little thicker than others, which was the only factor in variance for the level of doneness, a great job overall.  The lamb chops were served with creamed spinach, which was the only item that was not a hit with my party.  While the greens had been freshly wilted, the cream sauce was not quite what we were used to and the dish needed a liberal application of salt.  Overall, the meal was exactly what we had expected and was of good quality.The overall ambiance was nice; the atmosphere spoke of relaxed formality.  The overall noise level in the restaurant was fine, and more tables filled while we were there, we did not experience the usual din that can happen in a busy place. We had not anticipated the live piano, which only added to the experience.  The restrooms were clean and appeared to be attended to regularly.Once again we would like to give kudos to our server James, who deftly provided service unobtrusively when appropriate, and kept a careful eye on us throughout the meal.  We never felt neglected or over troubled by his attention, and we felt he provided the level of service one would expect from a consummate professional."
5 star rating,The hype over the fried lobster is overrated. The lobster was dried out. Had so much better. I asked for the lobster Mac and was talked out of it by the waiter. The calamari was overcooked. Such a disappointment.
2 star rating,The food is great. The service was not good at all. And tried to over charge me on items I did not get. If you go please go early in the day and not when it is about to turn into a club. Because people will be hoovering over you as you eat.
2.5 star rating,"I was so extremely disappointed. We made reservations for 10 of us back in February for Mothers Day brunch. When I made the reservation I informed them we would need to be somewhere near the food as my grandmother was 94 and used a walker. So we arrived today and we're seated at the furthest point away which was in fact the bar next door. We were the only patrons over in that area for quite a while until some others arrived to have a drink at the bar. I told the manager that I was dissatisfied with where we were being seated and reminded him of thea accommodations I requested when I made the reservation. The only thing he did to try and make things right, was to bring 3 chaffing dishes of food into the bar. Again, that did not help as it was only 3 things. Also the food we were quoted that would be served was not all true. The menu consisted of a southern theme, which I would not have opted for. I used to go to this restaurant in the past for dinner, however after today, I will never be back.   Very disappointed."
1 star rating,"Been wanting to try this place for quite some time and decided to go during Detroit Restaurant week. Made reservations for 8pm, got there about 10 min beforehand, the place was nuts so I was glad we made reservations. Upon checking in, the hostess seemed to be frazzled beyond belief. Ended up sitting another couple ahead of us because he thought they were us. Didn't get to our seats until about 830pm. Waited about 10-15 min for anyone to even come up and ask us for a drink once seated. Never even got served any water! In my opinion, you should never have to ASK for water. Finally ordered our food, had bread tossed at the end of our table, appetizers were cold and overpowered with red pepper flakes (WATER!!!!!), the shrimp and scallops in my pasta were the size of dimes and not cooked properly and also lacked any flavor minus the red pepper flakes. At this point, I felt like I had done the Kylie Jenner challenge my lips felt so swollen, numb, and huge from all the red pepper flakes (no I am not allergic to seafood). Waiter took our unfinished meals away even when we asked for a box (don't know why we wanted to take the food home) so we had to ask again. All in all, service was poor and slow, food was less than mediocre and not worth the $$. Will not be back."
1 star rating,Awful service and mediocre food. Just a poor experience overall. We had a reservation and still had to wait an hour even while walk-ins were seated before us. We're pretty easy-going restaurant folks but this is one place we will absolutely not return to or recommend!
1 star rating,"Great city decor/design and loation; excellent service and food; reasonable prices; live music (with mediocre vocalist but better than ""piped in"").  All-around very enjoyable dining experience - Detroit needs more places this good."
4 star rating,"Second visit and this time they really blew it.  Apparently serving cold food is their standard.  I decided to try their signature deep-fried lobster dish.  What a mistake and what a waste of lobster tails.  Served on a bed of cold mashed potatoes.  Served by a waiter (not the waiter that took our orders but a random person who never said a word - just pushed the dishes in front of the four of us).  Greasy lobster tails, stone cold mashed potatoes and a cup of drawn butter - does that sound tempting or what?  This was after bringing me my salad (wrong salad by the way).  Apparently we weren't eating fast enough for the manager (who last time was so good) who kept standing at our table and giving us nasty looks.  As soon as we started to move (under this nasty pressure from him) he rushed in to start clearing plates in such a hurry that he knocked my billfold on the floor.  For goodness sake give a guy time to leave the table man!  You are lucky I give you one star.  Oh yes almost forgot the parking over the road (full of puddles) costs $10."
2 star rating,"Atmosphere in the restaurant was great, relaxing, clean, jazz piano and vocalist and an excellent manager making a fuss of us.  The food was definitely ""OK"".  Unfortunately my Oysters Rockefeller were luke warm, small, and not particularly good.  Sent them back so second time around at least they were hot.  The mussels were very good, and the paella decent. The lobster tail trio was good but not remarkable.  With a little more effort this place could easily rate 4 stars.  Parking safe and easy.  There is valet parking but, despite it being quiet (plenty of empty tables on a Friday night at 7pm, there was no valet so we just parked in the lot over the road.  Guys - I'd like to make this place a favorite - let's pay more attention to the food and go to 4 stars!"
3 star rating,"Lobster macaroni was awesome, a must get!! Service was good, very polite. Will defiantly go there again."
4 star rating,"First visit . There will not be a second. Bland, chewy, over cooked lobster. Undercooked Chilean sea bass. There are so many great places to eat why bother trying again. The overall vibe is that you don't really matter to them. The bathroom is filthy. If you want a great meal with exceptional service and the best swordfish you may ever eat go to Andiamo! Very intimate and warm."
1 star rating,"Me and my wife went on a Sunday evening. The atmosphere is nice and the waitress was very pleasent. It wasn't that crowed but they were still a little slow, makes me beleive that on a Saturday or Firday night could be bad. But the food was good. not great but good enough to go back. The deep fried lobster tails were really good and so was the mac&cheese lobster dish."
4 star rating,Very good. My friend and I went there for lunch and the prices were very reasonable. I had the salmon sandwich. Delicious!  We went at a very non-busy time as many of the offices in Detroit are closed or the city workers are off due to the Christmas/New Year holiday but the waitstaff was attentive and service was great.  I would definitely recommend this place.
5 star rating,"Went here while visiting from out of town, I would have to say I was impressed with the decor of the building.  The food was pretty good we ordered the tilapia, trout, fried Shrimp and mac and cheese lobster was excellent!!  The Peach Cobbler was just okay,  The owner was there, he was really nice as well as the manager and server."
2.5 star rating,"The service was excellent on a Friday night. We had theater tickets and the waitress made sure to get us to the Detroit Opera house on time. The specialty martinis are to die for. I wasn't crazy about the scallops wrapped in bacon, but the artichoke/crab dip was excellent, as were the sweet potato fries."
4 star rating,"When I realized this was the place my boyfriend picked for our Valentine's Day dinner, I tried to keep an open mind because my last experience here years ago was underwhelming. We were seated at a table in the middle of booths with other patrons facing us, which was awkward but no big deal because we were hungry and really only cared about the food. When we sat down the chairs were so low we had to reach up to grab our drinks and eat- also awkward but we were told there would be a wait for a booth. The food was prepared without care, thought, or seasoning. Our oysters were the worst I've ever had and they were obviously old. I was worried about even eating them but I didn't want to make a fuss on Valentine's Day so we did. The lobster mac and cheese was pitiful. It was dry, included very little ""lobster"" and didn't taste like anything. There was even a big piece of plastic wrap left on the plate just to remind you you're eating something prepped on some other date and kept in the fridge until someone ordered it. I had ordered the ""paella"" as soon as the waitress (really nice and none of this is her fault) brought our drinks because the menu says you should allow 20 mins for it. Well, it came out fast (before the scallops) and in the pan as promised. Clearly, whoever is in the kitchen has never actually had paella because anyone who has eaten it or who has ever casually read the definition of paella knows that you have to actually cook it in that pan and the edges get crispy. The ""chef"" just dumped unseasoned rice, shrimp and mushy carrots and squash into the pan and sent it out like that. That's not paella. That's rice-a-roni in a pan without the seasoning packet added. My boyfriend's scallops came out with a little plastic cup filled with what was supposed to be a jalapeño aioli that he thought his scallops would be cooked in. The scallops themselves tasted like cheap Chinese food for some reason and his rice and vegetables were soggy and completely bland. Basically, we paid $85 for food I had to take home and doctor up to make it enjoyable. If the chef is wondering, I added onions, garlic, salt, pepper, tomato paste, capers and actually baked the ""paella"" in a cast iron pan to make it crispy. I've never paid $25 to make my own meal taste good and I won't do it again. DSM has had its last chance."
1 star rating,"We chose to try Detroit Seafood Company during Detroit Restaurant week. What can I say, I can't believe this place can have enough business to stay open. First impressions: the hostess appeared distracted and ignored our presence for far too long, in addition she also sat a table of two ahead of us who did not have a reservation, while we did. Next: we were seated well over 15+ minutes before a server came to our table to even start with a drink order. Service was slow and inattentive, almost non-existent. Now on to the food: we did try the menu for restaurant week and also an entree from the everyday menu. They had run out of the mussels listed on the restaurant week menu so we instead chose the lobster/seafood bisque which amounted to nothing more than a bowl of red tomato bisque served lukewarm to cold with a hint of seafood flavor. Next course, the Fishermans stew which tasted like chewy seafood swimming in a bowl of oregano. The entree from the main menu was extremely bland and was served with what appeared to be a serving of uncle Ben's rice pilaf. Honestly the only good thing about our experience at this restaurant was the person I shared it with."
1 star rating,Love this place.  Food has always been great and servers friendly and attentive.  Would travel to Detroit to eat here even if I wasn't visiting family. The music is always good and never so loud so you can have conversations
5 star rating,"Very hit and miss.  A nice location/building and ambiance. Parking right across the street ($10). Some thing were great (oysters, tuna tartare, paella, gumbo, the bread). But the ""Ahi Tuna"" dinner was NOT ahi and was dry...did not finish.  Salads meh. Some of the service was good. Some thing took a long time or were forgotten.  Overall ambiance was cool but some things seemed dirty (floors).  Lady's room attendant was an awkward, amateur experiment.  Really not sure how to rate this because of the variation in the highs and lows. We probably won't try again just because there are so many options these days in Detroit, but I would not warn people away from this place, just be open to a hit/miss experience."
3 star rating,"This was our first time and we went with  couple. The web site and yelp specified valet, but when we pulled up there was no sign of valet, then i was told by the hostess that they do not have valet.... huh?? We paid $10 to park directly across the street. We had a 7pm reservation and the place was packed. We waited a bit for our table then we we were seated on top of the band's speaker, the hostess was nice enough to move us further away. It was still obnoxiously loud, a little unpleasant to try and have a conversation. We were given water an bread right away, the bread was fresh and the herbed butter was delish. After 4 different waiters came to our table trying to figure out who was actually assigned out table I think they figured it out.  The place has a ton of staff but they all seem to be really confused. We waited forever to even get a water refill, they may want to assign one I their 50 person waitstaff to water duty. We ordered the lobster Mac and cheese because of the great things we had heard and it came out quickly. It was hands down delicious!!! All four of us loved it!! It was downhill after that. I ordered the tilapia with a 1/2 lb side of crab legs, my husband ordered the swordfish and our friends had the crab cakes and the stuffed salmon. I wouldn't order the tilapia again, it wasn't very good and came with soggy vegetables. The crab legs were great...hard to mess up. I kind of wish I would have gotten the full pound of crab legs and skipped the tilapia. My husbands swordfish was so disgusting he had a we bites and didn't touch the rest. Our friends liked the crab cakes and stuffed salmon, I didn't try either.  The waiter noticed my husbands plate and did offer to get him something else, but we we were all finished by then. My husband didn't tell him it just wasn't good, so I did and he returned to tell us he removed it from the bill, which we totally didn't expect and thought was super nice. We only saw our waiter the two times and service was truly lacking. Our bill came to $150 for dinner for 4 people (well 3 after he one was removed), an appetizer , two glasses of wine and two martinis.  Which we thought was pretty good. The Reataurant is nicely done with high backed booths, but just entirely too loud. We had to go next door to the bar to use the restroom and it was soooo quiet compared to the restaurant. I don't think I would return. If the dining experience was just based on our two meals I would probably have rated it a one star, but he app was sooo good. I think there are much better restaurants in Detroit, I wouldn't recommend this one."
2 star rating,"First off, I'm not all that into blasting restaurants on-line or anything else for that matter, but tonight really deserved it. So we make reservations and get sat as soon as we walk in. The band is playing loud but not too loud, thankfully decent music. We sit at our table and have a brief discussion over the menu and before you know it 10 minutes have passed.......Have yet to meet our server but see plenty passing back and forth through our section. Finally a gentleman comes and asks which drinks we'll be having. ""We'll just start with water please thank you"" he replies that our water and bread will be coming shortly. My girlfriend watches as he continues to attend to other tables sat in the area. 5 minutes later a food runner finally brings us the water, moments later the first gentleman returns and says the bread is on the way. At this point I can now assume that he's our server, just an assumption though because he NEVER introduced himself and we NEVER saw him at our table again for the remainder of the time we were there. From my view I see a couple arriving to the restaurant from the street, moments later their sat in our section just across from us. They're promptly greeted (with water) and asked if its their first time in the restaurant. No more than two minutes later their server returns with bread and takes their order. Right at the 30 minute mark I finally reached my breaking point. The inconsistency in service and overall lack of caring or correcting was breathtaking. Again, I'm not the type to typically complain but this was ridiculous. I would love to give a review on the food but couldn't even get complimentary bread after being seated for a half hour so the one star that I was forced to give is for ......hmmmmm.......the classy tray of mints they have at the door? We left and had a MARVELOUS dinner with impeccable service at Wolfgang Puck"
1 star rating,"Nice looking place, friendly service. Saturday night reservation, prior to a show. No problem with promptness of seating or service, including wine list. But for a restaurant, the food determines the stars.Do not order the ahi tuna... too thick, too tasteless, too tough. It indeed came rare as ordered but it just had no flavor to it. If you've had the same in Charleston and elsewhere done right, you will not like this. I ate about two-thirds and the rest went back.Other meals (party of four) were OK... but nothing for special praise. Perch probably the best of the other four order."
3 star rating,"had a Groupon which took us there, however don't know if I go back.  Portions where small & staff seemed like they wanted to hurry you along."
3 star rating,"I dont know how anyone could say anything bad about this place. It was SOOOOOO good. We had the lobster mac and cheese, i had the fried lobster tails and my husband had the surf and turf. It was pricey, for sure, but the food was seriously amazing.  More than that the restuarant itself is gorgeous on the inside. It is so romantic and classy. Perfect for a date night or fancy pants dinner. Go here. And invite me to come with you :)"
2.5 star rating,"A friend and I ate at the Detroit Seafood Market last night and were thoroughly pleased with the experience.  We had a perfectly delightful waiter, Calvin, who suggested we try the fried lobster tails and the stuffed salmon, both of which were quite tasty.  Throughout the visit our waiter was funny, engaging and attentive.  The food was delicious (we had the fried calamari for an appetizer, not the best ever, but solid, good calamari), the ambience was elegant, and the service great.To top off an already wonderful dining experience, at the end of the evening while waiting for my friend to join me, I saw Calvin, our waiter, rushing past me to the restaurant's door.  He soon turned around and, to my surprise, I realized he was trying to find me to give me the smart phone I had left behind on the table.  I can't say enough good things about my trip to the Detroit Seafood Market, but I will definitely be going there again in the not too distant future."
5 star rating,"I can't believe the good reviews! This place was awful.. Slow service, didn't take our order, no one knew what was going on   Very disappointed"
1 star rating,The sea bass melted in my mouth and shrimp and lobster fettuccine was perfectly prepared with excellent flavor. Wonderful atmosphere and service! We are looking forward to our next meal at dsm.
5 star rating,This is a great place to grab a bite to eat. With several selections on the $10 lunch menu you can't go wrong. All the food we tried was fantastic! I had fish tacos and my hubby had the tuna steak sandwich. We also tried the Thai chicken which was good and spicy. We sat outside and it was a perfect day. The only thing that could gave been better is the service was slow and the food coming to use was slow. We went at 1:30 on a Thursday for lunch & the place was not busy. It took us 2 1/2 hours after sitting down to eat and get our food.  Our appetizer took 30 minutes to come to us and our main dishes took 1 1/2 until we got them. Never a refill on drinks or a bread basket either.  So have time to spend when dining here! Our waitress only came when our food was finally ready to serve we never saw her again until we tracked her down and asked fur our bill. She was super nice just slow.
3 star rating,"Fried lobster was different, but good.  The stuffed salmon was the best I've had in a while.  Great ambiance & service."
5 star rating,"I went here for a friend's birthday party. I was really taken aback by the ambiance of the place. The vibe of the place was laid back. We were seated and waited a while for service after that, at least 15 minutes. The food was great.   However we all were charged on the same bill after stressing in the beginning to be billed seperately. Gratuity was included which i think is unfair considering that the service was not that great. Won't say That i will be going back anytime soon but I did enjoy the food."
3 star rating,"I had my birthday party @pv lounge. They promise me that my guest could get in for $10 which was a lie. After midnight they started charging people $25 at the door and by 12:30 it was $30. And by 1am it was $35....ridiculous. Also I paid in full for my party a month in advance and at the end of my party the waitress hands me a bill for $2200, after I told her I had already paid and the name of the manager I paid it to, she said she didn't know who I was talking about and had never heard of her....luckily I had my receipt with me. I will never have a party there again....shady place"
1 star rating,"The server was extremely polite but not necessarily attentive.  There is a difference.  The gumbo was mediocre and the Caesar salad was average with powdered cheese instead of shaved.  The crab legs were the best I've ever had.  Loud ""ladies of the night"" at the bar made for entertaining people watching."
3 star rating,"We took my brother here for his birthday and had a great meal.  Great setting, great food, great service.  It was hard to decide what to have from their menu because there were a lot of great choices.   We of course tried the Lobster Mac n Cheese.  It was amazing.  Our entrees included the Surf & Turf, Florida Snapper and the Swordfish Oscar special.   We all loved our meals including the veggie sides and jasmine rice.   We then topped if off with dessert  - - creme brulee and a chocolate lava cake.   They gave us the creme brulee on the house and brought it out on a plate with Happy Birthday written on it.   Very nicely done.  Servers were so on top of things that we had to tell them a few times to leave the plates on the table so that we could have the very last bite!We had made reservations, but didn't need them.   Highly recommend this for a night out with special people!"
5 star rating,Took my MOM for her B-Day. Food was really good I definitely would frequent this restaurant. the Lobster Macaroni n Cheese was Great! The Salmon was very satisfying. The best part of the night was the Entertainment. The guy on Friday Nights is the best. Service was a little slow but ok overall. Will definitely go back!  Prices were very reasonable.
2.5 star rating,"Wanted it to be great-- it was just okay. If we hadn't had the Groupon we would have been very disappointed. The appetizer was great (small for the price- 3 scallops)... I had the sea bass- it was great, the sides were just boring though (unflavored rice, asparagus).. my husband had the stuffed lobster, it was good and the sides were potatoes (okay) and oriental stirfry veggies (not sure how this went with the meal at all- but they were great). Downfall- they served butter flavored oil instead of clarified butter or even just melted butter with the lobster- it was HORRIBLE (and for 42 it should have been real butter). Both of our desserts tasted like they were not made on site- I had cheesecake and reminded me of a frozen/thawed one- and it had processed whipped topping on it (not even whipped cream!!!)  my husband had the lava cake- while better than chain restaurants- it also had the frozen/thawed/warmed up taste going on. Service was good- to bad the meal doesn't go along with the prices and the details of the meal (fake butter, fake whipped cream, dull sides, boxed desserts) really ruined it for us. Wouldn't go back- but at least it wasn't horrible."
3 star rating,"For the second time this restaurant has called the night before my reservation to cancel due to a private party. I specifically asked the hostess if there would be a private party that night, due to it being the NAIAS Charity Preview,  she put me on hold to ask the manager, she said there would not be a private party and took the reservation.   When they caaled to cancel, i spoke with the manager and he informed me the restaurant was reserved since last year and there was nothing he could do. This is an impossible night to find a restaurant. This is VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!  Had they offered a gift certificate, I would have considered going back.....I will NEVER GO THERE!"
1 star rating,The Sunday Brunch-Mmm Mmm good! And the jazz saxophonist-Herbie Russ-very talented-and he can sing too! We really enjoyed the experience.
4 star rating,"My husband and I had dinner here on a Sunday night. We entered the restaurant and were not greeted by anybody. The hostess was not there and the two employees at the bar did not acknowledge us. Finally after waiting for a few minutes a waiter came over to seat us. At the same time the hostess came over and totally ignored us. The waiter was very friendly. However, he kept saying that our food would be out any minute. It was at least 20 minutes or longer before we got our food. The food was good, but nothing that I would come back for."
2 star rating,"Celebrated our 15th anniversary here last evening.  The food was wonderful, Benny our server was very attentive.  All entrees were reasonably priced. Was a great experience and would highly recommend for a romantic dinner for two."
4 star rating,"Great ambience, great menu, food tasted great, but the service was so bad that it overshadowed everything.  The waiter acted as if we smelled bad, he had no table-side kindness, never smiled, rarely checked in on us, and when he brought desert, he left before offering us coffee or an after dinner drink, and never came back.  It's a very expensive menu, and a lovely dining room with great music.  We were prepared to stay late, spend lots of money and tip liberally, but we didn't get the chance.  I wouldn't go back unless I could be assured of a different waiter.  Wait staff should either add to the experience, or be neutral, but they should not detract from it."
2 star rating,"Stopped in for dinner after a 4pm Tigers game.  We enjoyed the dinner atmosphere with a live jazz trio and nice menu.  My wife and I asked for the draft beer list and were told only bottles were available.  After ordering, we received the bottles.........and no glasses.  We decided to split a bowl of seafood gumbo and seafood Paella for two.  We knew the paella takes time to prepare, so we split a bowl of seafood gumbo, however the gumbo arrived only 5 minutes before the paella ( should have been 15 minutes).  The gumbo had  a very nice roux, but no seafood, only some sausage slices.  The "" seafood"" paella had 4 shrimp, 3 mussels in the shell,  and what tasted like a few smaller mussels and a few pieces of calamari - about half the amount of seafood we were expecting for a seafood paella for two at $43.  Based on the meal this would be a 2 star review, but the atmosphere added a star.   Will go back someday, but not any time soon."
3 star rating,"Really, really liked this place.  I actually cannot believe that I have not been here before, since almost the entire menu was seafood.  I think there was one steak, one lamb meal and one chicken meal?  Anyway, it took me a while to figure out what I wanted, cuz everything looked awesome.  I ended up getting soup and salad (clam chowder with ceasar salad) and the app of lobster mac and cheese as my meal.  Everything was perfect.  The chowder had a great mix of veggies in the soup, and the salad was perfect.  The lobster mac and cheese had huge chunks of real lobster and was hot and yummy.  They gave me friend free dessert for her bday, which was a great treat as well.  Service was PERFECT and very friendly.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because they were out of creme brulee, they did not really keep the homeless people away from the entrance (meaning we were harassed as soon as we left), and the ambiance was kinda--boring.  Also, there is no parking nearby that is free unless you really search and they do not validate or pay for it.  Other than that though, awesome exxperience and I will be back for sure."
4 star rating,"first off i made reservations for mothers day 3 weeks in advance for 5:30pm we arrived we did not get a table until 6:30pm when we were seated we had to wait on menus shortly after we placed our orders which consisted of salads, appettizers, lobster tails, crab legs, catfish, chicken wings nothing major well around 7:30pm we still had only received crab spinach artchoke dip, buffaflo shrimp basket and oysters when waiter brought that out he claimed our main dishes would arrive shortly ok well @8:30pm the waiter was asked where was our food he explained he had to check needless to say we left without eating very poor service still had to pay $72.00 for 2 salads tht were ordered  with entrees and spinach dip ,oysters, bread, water, they ran out of lemonade and sprite and butter this was a horrible mothers day dinner three yrs ago i dined here for mybday and service was great i will assume this establishment is under new everything because i will never go back 3 hours and no food i was pissed"
1 star rating,"lovely server, can't remember his name, and delicious food: the perch piccata was a delicious twist and the deep fried lobster? needs no explanations. pretty pricey, we owe the privilege to my in-laws :) thanks tim and debbie!"
2.5 star rating,We had never been to the Detroit Seafood Market but we bought a LivingSocial voucher for a 7-course meal. We weren't sure what to expect but were very pleasantly surprised. The food and service were excellent and the ambiance was very pleasant. Nice live light jazz music accompanied dinner. The restaurant is easy to get to with parking right across the street. We'll be back for sure.
5 star rating,"Called Saturday afternoon for an evening reservations, no problem, got an 8:30 table. Even though there was a home tiger's game we were able to find a meter parking spot a block away on Gratiot. We arrived at 8:30 and were seated immediately. Our waiter was excellent, very polite and attentive and offered an excellent wine recommendation. We started with the 5 spice ahi tuna which was outstanding, the  jalapeno aioli was a little hot for us but still good. GF had the stuffed salmon and I had the fried perch both were very good. My rice was under cooked but otherwise everything else was excellent. Atmosphere was a little loud but not too loud that we couldn't talk. We skipped dessert and decided to have a 2nd bottle of wine instead. The waiter didn't once rush us or make us feel that we needed to leave so he could turn the table. This was our third dinner here and will be back again soon!"
4 star rating,"There is nothing that I want more than to be able to write an incredible review on this restaurant.  Great location and atmosphere.  Good food and wine selection.  For the third time-just mediocre service- at best.  Dirty dishes left on the table.  Not enough place settings for all in attendance, even after requesting it a third time. Had to ask twice for the waiter to come back to the table because once he took our order, we never saw him.  They really need to have a hard core training of their wait staff."
2 star rating,"I'm not much of a fine dining kind of guy, but every once in a while I come here for lunch on the weekend, its not crowded at lunch time, its a bit pricey, but its a great place to take someone if you want to spend some money and impress. Unfortunately  I haven't seen lobster on the lunch menu but the Lobster Mac I recommend being ordered every time you set foot in the place."
5 star rating,"I made reservations here for New Years Eve because my bestfriend and I wanted to do something different. We wanted to get dressed and have a good meal. They had a special going on where you can choose 4 courses for a certain price which included a bottle of Moet. It was a select menu but they had incredible options to choose from. I had the calamari,seafood gumbo,fried lobster and added Red Velvet cake for my dessert!! Everything was DELICIOUS. I don't even have a complaint about the quality of food. The service was wonderful. I can't remember our server name but she had been there since 10am and I couldn't even tell because she was very sharp and didn't miss a beat. Bennie who was another server on duty was very sociable and classy. They seem to be very passionate about the food that they serve and maintaining a high level of service, which is expected when your bill is going to be past the $100 mark. :) Looking around there were a lot of well respected people around from the Detroit community. You are sitting amongst great people. They even had a private booth towards the back that had curtains to separate the guests from the other patrons. I never seen anything like it before. I do think the red velvet cake slice was very small and I expected it to be better. it was just ok. I went next door afterwards to PV lounge. I must say, based on the website I thought it was going to be a more upscale crowd. The scenery was like night and day from the restaurant. The website said it's filled with many young upscale professionals. Well they can do a little bit more cleaning up. The waittress served me two patrons and then we ordered another round. Two different prices? One round was a $1 cheaper. I wasn't about to make it a big fuss because, hey, it was new years eve:) Overall I had a great time. I will certainly return to the restaurant!!! Thanks for a great evening!!!"
5 star rating,"Work In Progress !My wife and I joined or friends for dinner last night. We arrived right on time and were seated right away.We loved sitting by the floor-to ceiling windows watching the snow pass through the street lights and noticing people arriving for dinner. A fair amount of young couples which show promise for Detroit. Our waitress came over right away to introduce herself. Took the time to explain what we should know about our choices ( crab cake one, not two just so we know). The wine was relly good ( Sonoma Chardonnay). We do eat out often, date night every Friday is a standing rule. Living in Western Wayne County we like the Haggerty Road strip between 6 & 7 mile roads. Everything in one place. Just to the point, my wife didn't eat her meal, just took it home, said it was too salty. Her gumbo was so thick you could almost stand a spoon in it, more like a stew, sent it back.I had the crab cake (1) really dry, lots of breading couldn't taste the crab, just breading. I ordered the Florida Snapper sent it back, pink in places, not fully cooked. reordered the blacked Snapper, better. We enjoyed our friends, talking about everything remembering my days working downtown Detroit. We couldn't have had a better seat, just people watching. Ok, so we didn't enjoy or food experience, sorry for my wife, our time out is what we look forward to. Next Friday we'll be at it again in our comfort zone. Here is what I saw, a wait staff that need training or ones that come with common-senseical know-how on how to properly serve and pickup from a table. You don't reach in front of you guest to remove a plate for the table ,above their head ( maitre d' ). You ask before removing a dish to be sure your guest is finished with it. Common sense not a storm trooper mindset, Ok, your food is here let's clear the table, right now !. There's just too many choices to have a good meal. Just having a meal is not my idea of a good night out.I may make it back there some day but maybe not. I wasn't a good night for us but we did enjoy or friends and the view was Great !"
1 star rating,"one of the places i have readily enjoyed visiting is detroit seafood market.  my first time there was about eight months ago, when i first arrived.  a new friend, who moved from dearborn to detroit downtown and wanted to explore his new neighbourhood.  i drove to meet him, since we had three events to go to, we thought to grab a bite at detroit seafood first. (the other two places - parties were nearby).  let's face it - macaroni and cheese is one of my favoured american meals.  it is so great.  everything about it is delicious.  so, to my GREAT  HAPPINESS detroit seafood has  a baked lobster mac and cheese!  that with a side of sauteed spinach was excellent.  we had gone on a friday (which had live music) and full-house in the traditional dining (which i never sit in) and a full crowd at the bar.  my friend (who works in politics) informed me that our companions at the bar were all other politicians and their associates.  julian, one of the general managers was gracious and friendly and even bought me a welcome to detroit drink.  cheers!each time i have gone there, there has been an interesting mix of personalities from actors to politicians to athletes.  though i am generally casually dressed, the dining crowd is usually 'done up'.  not sure how detroit would rate this place in terms of pricing - but everything i ordered was excellent.  the decor is so lovely and vibrant - kind of feel lost in a sea --- surrounded by lovely dining experience.  another reason i sit at the bar is to have conversations with others.  my friend and i networked with everyone there.  the bartenders are exceptionally sassy and prompt and each time i go back it is as if i was just there. sometimes i stop by the front window and wave and they always wave me in.  we exchange smiles and mimic ""sorry - stop waving hello --- will be in soon"".  the smiles from the staff here are priceless for me.  they are all terrific personalities.  if not for restaurants like detroit seafood, i would not love detroit so much.  thank you. cheers, xiang cclc"
5 star rating,"My husband and I ate dinner here on 4-29-11.  We both ordered the DSM Steamer, which was lobster, clams, mussels and crab, potatoes and corn.  How very disappointing!!  The plate looked like an appetizer!!!  I have never seen such small clams in my life!  Even the sauce is was steamed in was blah!!  At $27.00 a plate I expected a whole lot more!!  We both left hungry!!"
1 star rating,"Horrible, bad food, bad service.  No one working there cares at all.  It took a half hour just to get silverware on the table.  They even screwed up the coffee.  We ordered double espresso and we got a full cup of brown water.  In a regular sized coffee cup.  Fish was over cooked.  Staff had no knowledge of the menu, and the place is overpriced."
1 star rating,"While we had reservations for 8 at 5:30, we were not seated at a table until about 5:50.  Our waiter arrived at our table and asked if we were seeing a show and we said yes, at 7:30.  He proceeded to take our drink orders, however no wine list had been brought to the table.  He brought back a menu and we ordered drinks and when he arrived a few minutes later with water, we ordered appetizers.  15 minutes or so later, he finally came back with drinks and to take our food order.  Several times over the next 20 minutes our waiter walked by our table and didn't stop to ask how we were, fill drinks, refill water, bring more bread.  After another 10 minutes, we were finally able to find him and ask about our food and explain that we needed all food on the table (apps and entrees) at the same time because by this time, we only had about 20 minutes until we had to leave.  It was at this time he chose to tell us that they were out of scallops, which two of us had ordered.  !!  We quickly came up with other options (I chose whitefish, grilled.  Very unimpressive) and soon our apps arrived.  We ate those and waited another short bit before flagging down our server again to ask about our food.  By this point, I was ready to say cancel the order because we have to leave for the show.  Our food arrived shortly after and we all inhaled what sat in front of us.  One member of our party chose to not eat her food so that she could go chat with the manager, who promptly took 30% off our bill.  They still added on the automatic 18% gratuity, tho.  I found all of their food mediocre, certainly nothing to draw me back.There are so many delicious options in the area that I can safely avoid this hassle.  What a disappointment."
2.5 star rating,"I have been to going to Detroit Restaurant Week for the past few years and have really enjoyed myself. This was the worst experience I have ever had. My significant other and I were seated at 8:45 pm at a table that faced the kitchen. Almost immediately we were blasted with rap music through the doors that lead into the club that was next door. Every two minutes those doors would open with people passing through and the loud music interrupted what was supposed to be our romantic evening. We had chosen this restaurant based on the desserts of cheesecake and molten lava chocolate cake. As we ordered, we were informed they did not have these desserts, instead they had key lime pie and bread pudding. YUCK! Very disappointing. Our appetizers were cold and our water was not refilled for 20 minutes. People dressed for the bar next door kept walking by and at one point shot girls came by our table to offer us Hennessy shots. Terrible service, inappropriate music and not enjoyable food. I won't be back."
2 star rating,I have been noticing the advertisements for this restaurant for some time. My husband and I both eat out slot for business and pleasure. We made reservations tonight and got there early to have a drink at the bar. There were about 5 open seats at the bar and a couple of bartenders. E sat for some time before being acknowledged. Gave our drink order only to find out it would be 10 minutes before they could stock the vodka for my drink and did not have the onions to make a Gibson martini. Ok fine. That bartender then gave our order to another and we waited again. Very disorganized and not attentive at all. We were asked to pay for the drinks and had to show photo ID. This place is trying to compete with Joe Muers. No comparison. We made the decision to cancel our food reservation. We were out $10 plus tip for valet and $25 for 2 drinks. I did not want to see what a fiasco dinner would turn into. We retrieved our car and drone out to Grosse Pointe and enjoyed a wonderful dinner at The Hill.
1 star rating,"First time to eat here....had the Groupon maybe this explains the food.   Our waitress asked how things were and I said I would NOT get my meal again.  Very salty and tasted very weird for seafood!   She wanted to make it right and told the manager on duty and he came over.  OMG!!!  he said he would bring out some nice grilled  garlic shrimp in arsenic....yes you read it right.   So meanwhile my husband finished his meal which he liked.   The manager brought my dish and said here is your shrimp and arsenic enjoy.  WHATEVER!!!!!   THE DAMN SHRIMP WAS NOT COOKED ALL THE WAY!!!  THE WAITRESS TOLD ME TO TAKE THEM HOME AND FINISH COOKING THEM MAYBE THEY WOULD TASTE BETTER TOMORROW TO ME?!!!!   I never ever complain about food and I only told her how my dish tasted and it wasn't in a nasty way that I answered her and told her it was ok.  But I thought, ok those four dime size mussels that i did get it eat wasn't enough to fill up a cat.   I had the seafood bucket I think it was $25.00.   So we stopped on our way home and bought a frozen dinner and I had to finish cooking the shrimp and added to my frozen dinner.  Did I mention I left there hungry?  I didn't eat but 4 dime size mussels and two pieces of shrimp."
2 star rating,"My fiancee and I didn't actually have the pleasure of dining at the Detroit Seafood Market.  I made a reservation on line on March 25th for a QUIET ROMANTIC table for 2 for Saturday March 31st.  I received the confirmation of my reservations on March 25th.  We were so looking forward to dining there, especially since it was a special night for us.  However, when we arrived, we were seated at this LOUD table right in front of the KITCHEN DOOR.  Not only was it not quiet, or romantic, it was very intrusive and disappointing.  We asked the hostess for another table, she told us to talk to our waitress.  We then asked our waitress for another table and she said she has to talk to the manager.  We waited patiently.  We were not rude or demanding, but I mentioned to our waitress that if we were walk-ins we would totally understand, but we made reservations 1 week in advance.  Anyhow, she came back and said the manager can't do anything about this, sorry.  So we left, and went to Fishbones, where we were seated immediately at a nicer much more quiet table.  We were very disappointed with DSM and will never attempt to dine there ever again.  Had the manager came and said ""I am so sorry for the inconvenience, please have a seat at the bar and order a drink and appetizer on the house until a table comes available"", we would have gladly waited.  Not only did the manager not offer anything, he did not even speak with us.  VERY unprofessional and bad business behaviour!  NO STARS!"
