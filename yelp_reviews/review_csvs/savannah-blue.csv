5/18/2022,5 star rating,Absolute must hit if you're in Detroit. Had the collard greens and Mac and cheese for appetizers followed by oxtail and shrimp and grits for entree. There was not a speck of food left on any plate sent back into the kitchen.  Great restaurant and very cool atmosphere.
12/12/2021,5 star rating,"This is my 2nd visit here and I think I reviewed it before, feel free to search that lol. Anywho, I came with my husband and another couple for a date night. We made an reservation which is highly recommended because it was pretty busy Saturday evening.We were immediately sat upon entering, please note that when you walk in you have to come up some stairs into the restaurant. Our server was pleasant and other staff(refilling our water and bus boys) were nice as well. The ambiance is really nice and comfortable, they had nice music playing and it wasn't too loud. We ordered the crab dip appetizer and it was delicious. They do not allow you subsitute menu items but will give you a double order of an item All of our food items were very good and all items were hot. Our entrees came out at a perfect time, they gave us enough time to in between finishing our apps before bringing the entree out which was great.Overall everything was really good and I would go back again. Make sure to check their dress code policy before going because they really do enforce it."
5/3/2022,4 star rating,"Came here on a Friday evening for a ladies night out. We had reservations and therfore seated shortly upon arrival. Once seated,  we ordered drinks and an appetizer. The Whiskey blackberry cocktail that I ordered was delish. I heard positive feedback from the other cocktails ordered by our table. Our waitress had welcoming customer service and provided us mini corn bread muffins as we waited for our appetizer to arrive. Sidenote: Its a very INTIMATE setting here. Perfect for date nights!Two of my friends ordered the catfish entree, one friend ordered the kale ceasar salad,  and I ordered the oxtail entree. The crab dip appetizer was yummy for sure. We all enjoyed that very much.Unfortunately,  it took about 45 minutes for our entrees to arrive. That wait time was quite unappealing might I add.   I was on my second cocktail by then.From what I was told, the ceasars salad was not that great. For the catfish dinners, I was told the catfish and yams were good, but the greens were EXTREMELY SALTY! I was given some on my plate to try, and I agree 100%. The amount of salt used on those greens was RIDICULOUSLY OUTRAGEOUS! If any of us had more than three bites, we would've all been walking out of there with hypertension. I don't know who's heavy handed with the sodium chloride back in the kitchen, but they need to pull back when fixing the greens. My oxtail dinner, in the other hand, was PERFECTION. The meat fell right off the bone, the risotto was creamy and delicious, the string beans cooked great, and the entire entree came together so well when all items placed on the fork for one bite. I ate it all!"
3/14/2022,3 star rating,"My cousin and I were led to this destination after much debate about where to dine this evening. After a phone call to her brother announcing he was here we knew where to go. My cousin has a hat on and we initially were unsure it it would pose an issue. As we joined a party in progress upon our arrival, we received some two shots of Patron each. We also each ordered a Patron Silver Margarita which was excellent! My cousin offered me some of his Lump Crab dip as I sat at the bar and it further confirmed that I was in for a good time. We went to toast for the first shot and I could tell upon further inspection that the glasses were stained. I alerted the staff and the shots were eventually replaced. It was said that someone had to go to the basement area to acquire a new bottle of Patron. I decided to order the Braised Oxtail entrée for dinner. When it arrived it was lukewarm at best. My cousin and I both asked for our plates to be warmed up so we could enjoy the food properly as it was flavorful. A representative came over to the bar, extended an apology for the food temperature. She went on to state that the food was being refired and a talk was had with the sous chef. The plates were brought out moments later. They were clearly the plates we had originally as we could tell where we had each tasted the meal previously. Nonetheless, the warm up was all that was requested and it was done so to my satisfaction. The meat was tender and pulling effortlessly from the bone. The Cheddar Risotto and Herbed Haricot Vert were perfect accompaniments. After while eating dinner, I perused the drink menu to order to determine a wine to order. To my disappointment. the Papillon was only available by the bottle. I opted to order a glass of the Nectar Imperial Rosé after dinner instead. Despite the hiccups throughout my time there, the service by Brandy was exceptional and I tipped her accordingly. I will return there to experience more of their offerings."
9/12/2018,5 star rating,"In preparation to send my son off to college, I wanted to celebrate his accomplishments thus far with a dinner. He wanted something soulful but not traditional food fare. This did not disappoint. I had the Braised Oxtails (pictured here) and he had their take on Fried Chicken. The space is very inviting yet intimate."
5/18/2022,5 star rating,"Probably my 4 th time here ove the years and it's one of my go to spots. Wonderful servers , great vibe and decor. The food is always good and the cocktails are on point, great for date night, family dinner etc. Will be back before too long I'm sure."

6/5/2022,5 star rating,"Stopped in with my husband while we were in town based on a friend's recommendation and we were so pleased we did!! Upon arrival the hostess was super welcoming and walked us to our table. Our server Sarah came over promptly ready to answer any questions and get things started for us. We ordered way too much food but everything was amazing...started with the crab dip, it came with crispy wonton chips and we ate ALL of it. For meals, hubs got the fried chicken plate which came with collard greens and candied yams. He really loved the sweet salty combo and was raving about the perfection of the chicken. I got the chicken wings with a side of Mac and cheese- I could not get enough of the sauce that came with the wings, it was like a spicy bbq type sauce that complemented the seasoning on the wings perfectly. The Mac and cheese was so cheesy and just had that homemade taste I was craving. All the food was made with love, you can taste it! The only regret is that we didn't have room for dessert. 10/10 will have to come back"
8/18/2021,3 star rating,"I stopped in for lunch over the weekend with one of my girlfriends. We both had the catfish from the appetizer menu (nuggets/strips, there'sa filet on the dinner menu but I didn't want the fries or coleslaw and no substituting a side). My friend had the sweet potato salad and I had the greens and blackeyed peas.The ambiance was great, the sides were delicious,  the catfish was supposed to be fried hard, but was just chewy...not the least bit crunchy and not hot or even warm. The service was pretty slow, but our server was very nice when she finally made it to the table...she did take my friend's plate off the table before she was finished with her chewy catfish, though. Will I go back? I'm sure I'll give it another shot one day, but I'm also sure I won't be ordering the catfish. The people at the table next to us had the wings, they looked really good, maybe I'll try those."
5/26/2021,3 star rating,"I just got thrown off on how we were greeted. We walk in an this lady open the door looking at us up and down. We both were dressed appropriately and looked amazing but the first thing that came out of that ladies mouth is that we might not be able to eat because of our attire. Both were wearing form fitting dresses, nice sandals and hair done. We both are tall petite women but for some reason our attire wasn't up to par with her. We walk in and we see people in sweats, gym shorts, girls in the same dressed as us, neon colored clothing, athletic wear.... just made me wanna walk away. The man at the front didn't think twice or say anything about our attire, it was just that host or greeter.Food was okay but was still bothered by the first impression. Oxtail was all fat, I've had it before and it's never been that fatty. Hummus was great, they just don't get enough bread"
3/9/2022,5 star rating,"Wow! Is all that I can say. I have eaten all over the US & some other countries as well. This was by far one of my favorite Experiences. The ambiance is amazing. It's comfy & cozy. Elegant & classy. The service was on point & even price wise totally reasonable. Now let's get to what really Matters... the FOOD. I ordered the salmon Jambalaya & BABY!!!!!!!! It was DELECTABLE. I can't even begin to describe it. The Salmon was perfect! The plating, the Flavor & the Flow of the Various Ingredients... I Mean "" YOU HAVE TO GET HERE"". It was spicy but not overpowering and the spice doesn't even LAST.. it's literally PERFECTION! The dry rub wings, I'll just say they are Golden & CRISPY! The Mac&Cheese is well cooked and Not overseasoned.  - OH & don't forget the Lump Crab CAKE! Please just indulge!..."
3/14/2021,5 star rating,"Savannah Blue is a safe choice. It's the restaurant you can trust if you want a soul food fix, with an ambiance that offers a touch of class- compared to standard soul food restaurants. Additionally, the food is consistent... meaning I've never tried anything that was displeasing. I know some find the Mac n cheese to be bland,  considering cheese is already salty, the Mac n cheese is tasty, and most importantly has the rightly baked texture and never watery. When I think about consistency in food, I like when I can return and the food at least taste the same if not better, but definitely never worse. I've had their grits, fried catfish, and all of their sides. Their snapper as I have pictured is my absolute favorite!"
3/5/2022,5 star rating,"This was my 3rd visit, haven't been in 2 years because of Covid. But food is still great from Oxtails, shrimp and grits, corn bread, Mac and cheese, yams, fried chicken breast, fried okra, catfish, crab dip. I was with a group of 6 and we shared dishes. Service is friendly and efficient. Parking is $10 but lot is safe with attendant. Reservation is high recommended if not required. You probably won't get seat with reservation on weekends.Sorry I did't try desserts, was too full."
1/11/2017,5 star rating,"Top notch restaurant. Food is great! I had the ox tails which were fallen off the bones. You will be tempted to suck on the bones. The good bread and grits were awesomely tasty. Wife had crab cakes which was also very good. Very good price, clean joint, cozy, and smooth ambience. I highly recommend. Make a reservation because you probably won't get a table if not."
11/12/2020,5 star rating,I was finally able to try this place. I reserved a table online. There is a 15 grace period. The place is pretty inside. I like the set up. There is a piano in the dinning area. The food came out fast. I got shrimp and grits with out mushrooms. This was delicious. I did not care for the mac and cheese. It was too dry for me. I got greens instead.
5/25/2021,5 star rating,"Let me start off by saying, Savannah Blue did not disappoint! The food and service was all outstanding."
1/31/2022,1 star rating,"My guest and I had an amazing time then we were alerted by the reservation forum we used, that we were no shows. That's a bummer! Because they charged us for ""missing"" our reservation. Although, the food was definitely worth the visit. SavannahBlue needs to treat their customers better."
11/23/2021,3 star rating,Food is good but i made reservations at 8 pm and now it's  9 and still no food just sitting at the table. I like the vibe inside and the musics good.. I'm pretty sure when i get the food I'm not gonna eat it all just because I've already ordered two drinks. Service is slow i seen someone say that in a previous review and i can understand why.
10/9/2021,3 star rating,We went back again years later. We sat by a dusty piano. Music was way too loud and a shouting match broke out in the kitchen. Good value for your meal but the fried chicken wasn't seasoned to my liking and parts were dry. Don't think we'll come again. Black eyed pea hummus is still amazing but they hardly gave us enough bread for the portion.
4/7/2017,5 star rating,"Mature ambiance, food seasoned to perfection, friendly and fast service, fair portions and price. I was very impressed and will be recommending to friends and family. For reference, we ordered Georgian hummus, shrimp and grits, and fried chicken. A small helping of cornbread gets served to your table too. There is parking behind the restaurant and on the street."
11/20/2021,3 star rating,Limited menu with mainly seafood dishes. They were out of Mac and Cheese. You would think with such a limited menu that they would have the items available on a Friday night.
11/19/2021,5 star rating,Worth every penny! Wasn't quite sure what I was getting myself into but I knew I love soul food. The decor was really nice and the waiter was even nicer. Got the shrimp and grits and I highly recommend!
9/6/2021,5 star rating,"This place was a real delight! A friend and I went on a Wednesday night and thankfully they were able to seat without a reservation. The little corn cakes that they start the table with were soooo good. I could have eaten those all day! Service was super nice throughout, checked in regularly, super helpful. For my meal I went with the shrimp and grits, which were fantastic. Full of flavor, so so good. Went with a Cherry Smash cocktail, and it was incredible! One of my favorite cocktails, to be sure. Henny VSOP, cointreau, lemon. Simple, sweet, spectacular. I would come back here again for just the cocktails they were that good - though the food was also great. Upscale soul food sounds like an apt description to be sure. Parking outside has an attendant that is charging you to park for the restaurant, cash only - just to be aware. There's a parking garage nearby and ample street parking that you can use your card for, but you should know that the restaurant-marked parking is cash only. Will definitely be back for this spot!"
4/11/2021,1 star rating,Ripped off! I'm so irritated writing this review because I feel like I got completely ripped off. I ordered the seafood chowder and what came out was definitely NOT anything close to seafood. It was potato chowder. I called the restaurant to see that it wasn't a mistake with the order and they confirmed it is the right order. There was absolutely ZERO seafood in it. Instead it was potatoes (which are not mentioned anywhere in the description) and salty tomato soup. Disgusting. Do better.
7/30/2016,3 star rating,"Really really good food. The seating is extremely disorganized in the lounge area. I won't recommend going to this place without reservations confirmed. Finding seating in the lounge area is like fighting for open seats in the Wild West  with other diners (not what I want in a good dining experience). The first time we came here, the hostess was super snotty and terrible! The server made up for it. The food was amazing so we gave it a try again. The second time around, we did have reservations so it was much more smooth sailing to getting seated. Again, the food was so good but it was so loud, we couldn't hear each other speak. So, instead of hanging around for more drinks after dining, we went to another spot."
8/17/2019,4 star rating,"Savannah Blue is aesthetically one of the nicest soul food restaurants I've been to.  It's spacious and tables are spaced far enough where you don't feel like you're sitting too close to another party.  The decor in the dining area in the back consisted of older pics from a different period that were cool to see.  The food was also very good!  I ordered catfish with yams and asparagus.  The asparagus was very good but found the yams to be a little bland.  The catfish was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  One of my friends ordered the hummus and a salad- which she really enjoyed.  The other is a vegetarian so she ordered collard greens and mac and cheese.  She was happy with her choices also.The only thing thing that I could have made the experience better was the service.  It took our waiter awhile to take our order and to bring the bill when we asked.  Other than those times though, we got really great service. And the service was still better than most soul food restaurants I've been to.  I still plan to visit again next time I'm in Detroit."
1/29/2022,5 star rating,"I was inspired to leave this review because last night I had THE BEST! experience.  The food, my drink; Excellent! Germaine at the bar made me the most delicious, blueberry lemon drop. It was fresh and juicy like a lemon drop should be! AND blueberries that were inside were so sweet and delicious. But wait...! The Foood!  Ordered the Red Snapper, which was SUPERB. I am a southern girl and know fresh fish! It was sizzling hot, crispy & fried in cornmeal! The bed of tomato/sausage rice that lay underneath, omg. And the collard greens and yams!!!! The yams! Truly the best I have ever had; sweet, candied with a hint of maybe lemon and orange!  And the presentation of everything, truly 5 stars!  Also, everyone we encountered from the host and bartender staff were welcoming, professional, and on point! This is rare to be hitting all marks, so wanted to share. Whomever is the Chef, I bow to you, same to management and owners, appreciate you."
12/10/2020,3 star rating,"We were super excited to check this spot out based on reviews, however, our excitement was crushed by our experience from security/doorman. My husband wanted to drop me off since it was so cold & he went to find parking. The doorman was rude & also seemed irritated that we did not have reservations (after entry we discovered there was no need because the place was practically empty when we arrived-possibly 5 other tables). Back to the doorman, I tried to enter and he told me I had to wait for my husband, REALLY?! We are not from Detroit but quickly learned that parking is not easy. So there I waited, in the cold. It wasn't until a actual gentleman came out & stated that I could wait inside & he seemed surprised that the doorman didn't allow me in. I let him know that the doorman told me to wait outside. My husband was frustrated that I was made to wait in the cold. Damper. Overall ambiance after entry was cool. Two sections for seating, we were set out of bar area. What was more disappointing was the ""strict"" dress code & standards listed on their website, especially after the lack of hospitality of doorman. I was also unimpressed with what looked like dollar store silverware...if you have high standards for patrons-step your game up. Service was good. Our server Christin C. seemed apologetic about the dirty plate I handed her that was already set out on table. The food saved the night, minus the small piece of aluminum foil I almost swallowed. Seriously the food was delicious so I hope they put more effort into restaurant experience overall."
6/6/2019,4 star rating,"While traveling to Detroit for business, I have a few opportunity to try some nice restaurants. On the first evening, I went out with a small group of people from Japan. They usually are taken to steakhouses, for that is what they are familiar with when they travel to the US. Now, I wanted something more unique, different, and interesting. Once we were settled at our table, they brought huge pieces of cornbread! My goodness! They looked really good, but unfortunately, it was just a-ok... it was kind of dry... Now, the main food. I told the Japanese guys about what they have, and they were mostly interested in Fried Catfish. Why? Well, you can't really find that in Japan. They all ordered it with different side dishes, and they all absolutely LOVED it! For me, I had something different in mind. I wanted the Whole Red Snapper w/ Savannah Red Rice. Can I get ""WOW!"" on the photos? And the fish was quite amazing, it was as good as it looked! The crispy exterior was keeping the inside moist and juicy, packed with flavor! It was a fun dish to have for sure. This dish was so huge and filling, I could not eat them all... I also had Collard Greens and Mac N' Cheese. The collard greens were good, but the Mac N' Cheese, not so much...since the main dish was so amazing, compared to that, these side dishes didn't shine at all. The service was good, not overly friendly but polite and professional. We were well taken care of. My colleagues enjoyed the food so much, they wanted to go back the next evening! We didn't have such opportunity, but they did get an awesome dining experience they will not forget!"
2/22/2022,1 star rating,Honestly the chicken was good but the sides (yams/ mac and cheese) was extremely bland it was not good at all also the waiter (Jermaine) we had was absolutely terrible he was short rude complained about how he wanted us to hurry up and order he was awful to be honest I will never come here again not that it matters but just to give everyone a heads up.. it's way to expensive I can have my 5 year cook better sides than them I would rather got to KFC its cheaper and tastes better...
9/14/2019,5 star rating,"I love this cool restaurant. We made a reservation for 7:30pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant wasn't too busy when we arrived, but gradually got busier when it got closer to 9pm. It seems like a popular nighttime spot.The dimly lit lighting and pleasant music created a great atmosphere. We ordered the catfish fritters as our appetizer. They were good and included a savory remoulade. Our waitress highly recommended the red snapper as a main course. Both the fish and accompanying rice were seasoned well. I really liked this dish.  My husband ordered the fried chicken and said it was good, but we both felt that the snapper stood out more. If we came back again, we would likely just share the red snapper since it was more than enough for 2 people. We had tons of left overs. The mac and cheese was very good and I would get this again as well. I am sad that I was too full to try the sweet potato bread pudding, but that sounded like an amazing dessert."
4/15/2019,3 star rating,"Cool interior, authentic food and , slow serviceI came here while in town for business and brought a few coworkers with me. I'm from Florida so Savannah is only a short drive and southern cuisine is plentiful, so I have high standards. We ordered a large amount of food and everyone at the table was very happy (they were all from Chicago and California). Personally while I thought a few items were really good (Crab Cakes and Jumbalaya), I thought it was mediocre overall. In addition the service was very slow (both drinks and food) even though the restaurant was nearly emptyThe fried snapper had a great presentation although the breading was not my favorite. The Blackened Shrimp was excellent. Overall it was a decent southern style restaurant in the middle of Detroit. If I wasn't from the south I would likely rate it much higher. Go for the crab cakes alone!"
6/26/2019,4 star rating,"Let's start on the low points first.This is a restaurant on the second floor which makes it not accessible for those unable to walk up the stairs. I did ask once inside to be certain and was told no. I actually was a bit shocked about this.Next up is parking. There did not appear to be dedicated restaurant parking. Based on their unique location street parking in front of the building isn't an option either. You will have to park a few blocks over in lot parking/garage parking or if you can find street parking. This can get pricey on game nights, concert nights or any other downtown event night.The service was on point. Our waiter was friendly, attentive but not over bearing and knowledgeable.Our food was decently portioned and flavors were great. Sadly there are only two deserts to choose from and I didn't enjoy either (we each got one) Access, parking and dessert aside, I did enjoy the entree and starters. I may go back"
3/7/2020,5 star rating,"The first time I came here was with a friend, for lunch...and it was great!  I had the catfish fillets with two sides, collards and yams!  And it was perfect!  Loved it.  A few days later came here with some gal pals after a convention in town...and we all loved it!  Had different things, and everyone seemed happy with what they got...food is good!  Flavorful and hit the spot!They had my favorite ginger beer, so I was winning just with that!  The chef ran out of ox tails and so fixed a special dish for me and I was very appreciative...and he came out to tell me.  Which he didn't have to do.This place was one of the highlights of my trip to Detroit. Will definitely come back for a visit, if and when I am back in Detroit again!"
1/30/2022,3 star rating,It was ok. Definitely not a place for older people or people with with mobility issue
9/15/2021,1 star rating,"Unfortunately the service was not good. Ordered a bottle of Belle GlosWhich usually runs for $50 if purchased in store, they had it priced at $85. Our server came back with a completely different wine, did not ask if that would be ok and proceeded to open it. I stoped him and told him that was not the correct wine that we asked for and he stated that they were currently out of the Belle Glos and the wine he brought over was the only Pinot they currently had. It was a bottle of Angeline which runs do $9 if purchased in store, yet we were still charged $85 for the Belle Glos. There was also some confusion with our entrees. Felt like they took advantage, was highly disappointed. Will not be returning."
11/28/2021,5 star rating,"We tried this place last night. The Seared Salmon w/ Shrimp Farro Jambalaya was excellent and the Georgian Hummus appetizer was too! The service could not have been better. Everyone was was so friendly, from the man that greeted us at the door, to the hostess that helped us with our coat as we left, and Sara our server could not have been any better! Would go back again."
1/1/2020,5 star rating,I finally got a chance to checkout SavannahBlue since sooo many people have been raving about it! Everything about this restaurant screams classy. From the moment you walk in prior to going up the steps you are greeted by a friendly doorman. Then upon arriving at the hostess stand you are again greeted by pleasant staff. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations for my boyfriend and me. For me it was an amazing cocktail that wasn't even featured on the menu but after getting and idea of what I wanted he though it would be a good choice and it was (I think it was a raspberry mule..?). Then we ordered the fried green tomatoes and crab cakes both were delicious although must admit I wish there were 3 vs 2 pieces for the fried green tomatoes. I ordered the seafood boil which was good and very filling but my boyfriend can't stop raving about the burger recommended by the waiter. Our date night couple also enjoyed the food and my friend who is abstaining from bread couldn't get enough of the cornbread! The overall ambiance is extremely comtemporary. Check it out and I am sure you will be pleased that you did. :) -Returned for another date night with my fiancé and we were just as pleased as we were on our first visit. I heard the oxtail ab risotto was one of their top dishes so I ventured out and ordered oxtail for the very first time ...while I've tried it before I've never officially ordered it. The oxtail was AMAZING and I highly recommend ordering it if you want to try something different. The risotto was also fire!

7/28/2021,2 star rating,"I was a first time customer, I had to call this place like 4 times to place an order after someone finally answered she put me on hold and then hung up had to call another 3 times before someone answered i was placing 5 carry outs 4 chicken breast meals and a catfish meal i was informed that i HAD to get fries with ALL of my meals and i cannot substitute them (it's their new rule) so i had to pay extra for the sides i actually wanted bill came up to $140, finally after a 30min maybe a lil longer wait of course the fries were SUPER nasty and we all hated them, the greens was good and the Mac was ok, most likely won't be coming back."
12/29/2019,3 star rating,"I took my aunt here for the holidays. It was both of our first times visiting. I ordered the braised ox tail and she ordered the fried whole red snapper. The ox tail dinner I had to initially send back because the accompanying risotto was crunchy and not done. The second try they didn't make a completely new dish, which I requested, they simply switched out the risotto. The new risotta was overcooked and had so much cheese in it, it was gooey. I told the server and she just kind of stood there. I ate most of the ox tail, but did not touch the risotto. The server clearly knew I was not happy with the meal and didn't even try to offer something else. My aunt loved the snapper. The only part she wasn't fond of was this sweet sauce that was drizzled on top. I tasted the snapper and it was quite flavorful. I also didn't like the glaze that was drizzled on top. If I return, I will order the snapper sans the glaze drizzle. The bed of rice it rested on was a tad bit spicy and we'll seasoned. The ambience was perfect for a date night. The lights were down low and each table had votive candles. It gave for a romantic atmosphere. I would suggest this restaurant."
6/23/2021,5 star rating,"Our party of three loved everything from the sweet potato salad to the salmon entree. Upscale soul food at its finest. Fast, friendly service in a modern jazzy setting. We will be back!"
1/10/2020,3 star rating,"A beautiful restaurant but the service was pretty hit or miss. I really loved the crabcakes they were really outstanding probably the best I've ever had and the sauce with it was so delicious it was a Cajun remoulade.And we had a really good corn bread and a really good house salad but the mac & cheese, cheddar risotto and beignets really disappointed but my mother really enjoyed her red snapper it was quite an impressive thing. Dining room was so loud it was hard to hear but the hostess told us this was unusual."
9/27/2020,5 star rating,Love it! The whole staff was great and the food was excellent. We had the crab cakes for an appetizer and they were on point. My guy had the fried chicken with greens and sweet potatoes and I had the whole snapper. Next time I'm in Detroit I will come back.

3/20/2020,5 star rating,"This is a hidden gem, for sure. The street entrance resembles a speakeasy door, and you must ascend a considerable amount of stairs once you enter. Upon arrival, however, you will be pleasantly surprised by the intimate, dimly lit ambiance, complete with a beautiful bar and lounge. It is reminiscent of a very modern, high- end New Orleans jazz club. The vibe is intimate and the food and service are phenomenal. This is the best comfort food wrapped in a sultry, sophisticated package. We started with the recommended Blackthorn, which is a twist on the Manhattan. It was the bomb! After drooling over all of the options, we decided on the buttermilk fried chicken, fried catfish, Mac and cheese, candied yams and collard greens. We were pleasantly surprised to receive the complimentary cornbread, which is infused with butter and glazed with honey. Both the catfish and fried chicken were perfectly spiced and crunchy on the exterior, but amazingly moist inside. The chicken was particularly juicy and came with an amazing maple pecan sauce. The collard greens were the best I have ever had, despite the fact that they use turkey in lieu of pork. This was a rare occurrence of fabulous taste and beautiful presentation with all of the dishes. Our server was amazing and suggested that  next time, we try the oxtails and beignets. Absolutely!!!"

The people working there are so personable, the food is incredible (we had the oxtail and catfish) and the atmosphere is like dark smooth jazz  Mesheka and the staff treated us so so well   10/10 would recommend!"

Not bad just not what I was expecting-Ambience was soothing yet sultry! Playlist was on point!-Wait staff was great except our bartender was also our waitress. I just felt bad because she had to handle multiple sides but our table was across from the bar so it worked out.Go there for any occasion and you will be satisfied!"

2/21/2021,5 star rating,I've never had grits before... But I never expected grits would blow my mind so hard. Their shrimp and grits dish is seriously TO. DIE. FOR. If you ask me about my selection for last meal... Believe me when I say shrimp and grits from savannahblue will be up there on my list.
12/29/2019,4 star rating,"SavannahBlue reminds me of the tv show Black-ish.  The restaurant's menu is sorta soul food. The ambience is sorta upscale.  And, just  like Black-ish, SavannahBlue is a ""hit.""  SavannahBlue serves up soul food right?  Well sorta.  The menu includes soul food staples, but it also includes Whole Red Snapper and Braised Oxtail, items generally not contained on a soul food menu.  (Maybe the menu is soul food inspired) On my visit, I ordered the Fried Chicken with Collard Greens and Sweet Potatoes.  My dinner companion had the Braised Oxtail and Seafood Chowder.  Overall, the food was good.  I tried my companion's Oxtail, it was tender but lacked seasoning for my taste.   Where SavannahBlue excels is its ambience.  The restaurant is located downtown away from the heart of the downtown.  It's in a nondescript building, believe me if you're not looking for it you would walk/drive right past it.  So, in order to enter you walk up a flight of stairs where you are greeted by a hostess table.   Once you enter, the first thing you notice is the bar.   The hostess escorts you to your table, which is past the bar into a separate dining area.  The dining area is dimly lit, but not to dark.  On my visit, I sat next to a window with a view of the People Mover.  The restaurant has a cozy, intimate feel.  The ambience is perfect for a date night or gathering of friends.  It doesn't feel like you're in the Detroit, it's kinda upscale but not really.I enjoyed SavannahBlue.  And, just like Black-ish, SavannahBlue should appeal to a wide audience of people.  For anyone looking for a cozy place to eat with some non-traditional soul food selections, I would recommend SavannahBlue."

2/23/2020,4 star rating,"This was my first time visiting this place. It was my mother's birthday and she insisted on a nice dinner downtown. I looked up restaurants on yelp and through a google search and came up with this spot. It was between here and Ocean Prime but I had a feeling she'd enjoy this more so I cancelled the reservation with Ocean Prime. Our reservation here was for 7:30 and since part of the party was running late...we sat at the bar. We ordered a few tasty appetizers and closed out our tab. As the rest of the party arrived and we were walking into the back seating area, the young lady asked us if we'd closed out our bar tab. It was quite obvious that we did so we were all a bit annoyed with the question & replied that she didn't have to be concerned abt the bar...it was handled. Either way, we were not on our way out the door and running off with an unsettled tab...we were abt to be seated. It was our first time as I mentioned so of course we were unfamiliar with the menu and our indecisiveness proved to be an annoyance for our waiter who seemed over us before we started. We made light hearted jokes & he was stone faced. When everyone didn't t have their  orders together he hastily asked if he needed more time and mentioned that at least 3 of 8 people had asked for him to come back to them. He was darn near walking away before we could even oblige and it wasn't like the place was busy. Had he not been so hasty maybe he would've realized I didn't have water and everyone else did. Whatever the case, I didn't understand why he was so impatient and dry with us...perhaps b:c his 50 dollar tip was included...I'm not sure but watching him approach another table smiling from ear to ear really left us baffled. We were not difficult nor rude or but we def didn't feel a warm welcome from him whatsoever.  Whatever the case, besides a bit too much salt...the food did not disappoint. I had to send back my collards which the waiter did remove from the bill and the Mac was underwhelming for everyone except my oldest sis who appeared to have a much creamier and tasty batch totally unrelated to everyone else's. We all ate her Mac which the server actually removed from the table while we were still eating it. We looked up and the plate was gone! Smh. Anywho, everything else was finger licking good! The crab cakes were full of meat and ohhh so tasty and I loved the catfish fritters. My sister loved the shrimp and grits she ordered. The dry rubbed wings were diff but tasty (hold the bbq sauce though). The black eye pea hummus was sooo good especially with the warm pita triangles (a bit salty though. My oldest sister got the ribs and loved them. Everyone else ordered the catfish entree which was of course was just as tasty as the fritter appetizer. The yams were decent. The drinks packed a punch. Overall, we were satisfied and stuffed. Since it was my mom's bday I did inquire abt bday accommodations and was told we could order dessert and  they could provide the candle. That was a bit disappointing. Overall, we spent abt 300 dollars w/ 20% of that going toward the tip. I would def recommend this place but you may want to ask them to take it easy in the salt when you place your order."

9/25/2020,1 star rating,First time at Savanna Blue and  arrived early for our 7pm Reservation.  We waited about 30 minutes to be seated only to have our seats taken by the owner of the restaurant.  The host was very nice and offered to have us seat at the next available table . Needless to say we won't be back!!
8/15/2018,4 star rating,"Based on other Yelper reviews we tried SavannahBlue recently and were impressed with the food overall, and at the same time have some suggestions for the team there to improve.One main reason you go out is for great food.  They have it.  Excellent menu choices, not too many but not too few.  The items we tried, overall, were fantastic (as outlined below).  The ambiance was hip, but approachable.  The restaurant is upstairs in a building, there's a large open bar area with comfortable seating where you can wait.  They have good music playing and then the dinning area is a smaller area away from there.First, a rundown on our meal:- Georgian Hummus Appetizer:  Delicious! the pita was perfectly fried and had a great textural contrast against the hummus. Recommend!- SB House Salad:  Delicious, light salad with the corn and tomatoes. Croutons are fantastic and dressing is perfect. Recommend.- Savannahblue Fried Chicken - Amazing. Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had, and loved that it was boneless. The chicken was to die for, so juicy (cannot express that enough) and maple pecan sauce was delicious, too. I found the collard greens, while good, were overly salty.  The candied yam casserole was great.- Crab Cakes - We went with the entree portion size. Delicious, on the spicy side so remember that. Overall a great crab cake but in retrospect we might have done it as an appetizer instead.- Savannah Beignets - While a beautiful presentation, we'd skip these in the future. Found them to be rather dry, not enough berry compote.  They were the low point of our meal.Next, why this great spot isn't getting 5 stars.  The service.  While our server was super friendly and sweet, it took way way too long to eat here.  The dining area was half full (even though they made us wait to be seated for some reason) and still it took forever to get service and then to move the meal along.  I'd love to look past it but just can't.  They have to improve the speed at which tables are serviced, especially when not at peak capacity on a Friday night.  When trying to get a drink at the bar before we were seated it took 10 minutes with just one person in line in front of me, with no good reason, just slow service and no sense of urgency or that people are waiting, in my opinion.Another thing that gets me (being the service business as well), is that the greeters weren't friendly.  We didn't feel welcomed or that they appreciated our business, but rather that we were just another reservation to get in.  People who came after us (same party size) were seated before us with no explanation at all.  The front of the house has to take some lessons in customer service.  That's the first impression people make to your business, these people must be the true ambassadors to start that positively!So all that said... will we come back?  Definitely, but not right away.  I hope they can work out some of the bugs related to service time.  In the meantime, I'm going to continue to think of their most amazing fried chicken ever!"
1/13/2019,4 star rating,Made a reservation via Open Table on a Sunday at 4. I arrived about 7 minutes late. Ascended the stairs and was greeted by the hostess. She promptly took me to my table located in the adjacent dining room. Our server was very pleasant and helpful. The ambiance of the restaurant was warm. Dark walls and dim lights. We ordered the wings as an appetizer which were good. I assumed they would be whole wings but they were wing dings. My oxtail dish with collard greens and cheddar risotto was great! The food arrived warm and was seasoned perfectly. My friend ordered the salmon with asparagus and sweet potatoes. Her potatoes were not fully cooked and was hard to cut. I would go again. Not sure if there is a elevator so if you have a disability I would call first because all I saw was stair access. There is a parking garage right across the street but I'm not sure if you can turn left off Grand River onto Times Square I think the access into the garage is around the corner. I found street parking & walked.

10/27/2019,2 star rating,"I really hate to give poor reviews but I must in this case.  The atmosphere is beautiful.  Visit tonight and our service was below 1 Star.  I ordered the catfish dinner:  all of our food was room temp.  Catfish didn't seem to be seasoned and not fried hard.  Yams were good and greens were bland and cold.  I wanted to complain to our server but we never saw her again after she took our order and notice she was also a bartender.  Needless to say, we didn't get a refill on our water, no condiments (tartar, hotsauce, etc) and no corn bread that we saw everyone else getting.  The hostess eventually gave us water and tried to help.  Again... we never had a waitress after we ordered.  Unfortunately I will not be returning.Update:  Thanks Ron for your concern.  It was pretty busy and it would have been nice if she let us know that waitressing wasn't her job.  Appreciate your response"
12/8/2018,5 star rating,"Oh SavannahBlue, you stole my heart. Savannah, Georgia is without a doubt my favorite city on this earth... and you encompassed her so beautifully. From the moment you walk in the door and see the photo of her Spanish moss dripping from the trees to the southern hospitality your servers show to the quality of the food. Thank you!Now onto the goods. I went with my folks while back in Detroit for Thanksgiving. Fresh cornbread for the table and boy was it fresh. What's the secret guys?  My dad got the fried chicken, my mom got the crab cakes and I got a Caesar salad with a crab cake. Everything was phenomenal with an extra shout out for the spicy aioli that came with the crab cakes. You weren't lying about the spice, and it was seriously so delicious! Without a doubt I'm telling you all... please go check this special place out!"
5/3/2021,1 star rating,"I was always told this is a good restaurant, however my daughter and I went on Sunday 05/02/2021 and I had to go home and cook myself dinner due to the lack at this establishment. Our server was absolutely horrible. We both ordered Fried Catfish dinner with fries and coleslaw with a side of Mac & Cheese.. We waited forever for our meal and requested corn muffins that were never received. Our server put our order in for a side of yams. When we received our food , the steak fries we not cooked completely. Needless to say, when it is over, all I had for dinner was three small pieces of catfish that were good but not enough for a complete meal. We spoke to the manager who apologized however, that did nothing for my credit card charge.  Not a place I want to go to again. Not good paying for something  and then having to go home and cook because you did not receive a full meal."

4/21/2016,5 star rating,"Soul food?? NO!! NEVER!! Southern food?? Not even close... it's somewhat of a mash up though. A little bit of the east,, a little bit of the west, a dash of south, and a generous helping of the midwest. Ladies and gentlemen, WORLD,, I proudly introduce to you SavannahBlue. The very definition of Detroit Cuisine.Ok, let's start the review with the setting. By definition a real detroit classy scene. The open concept, exposed brick, leather lined tables, dim lighting, Edison bulbs, industrial chandelier, all the way down to the cheeky baby grand. Yes!! The chicken fingers and fried potato sticks eater deterrent. I love you already!We order the following. Crab cake for the appetizer round. Shrimp and Grits for the fiancé and the Braised Oxtail for me. Then finally sweet potato cheese cake for the win.Crab cake, was as good, if not even better than the best crab cakes coming out of Baltimore. Then there's the shrimp and grits. I've never come across shrimp and grits that have wowed me until I've tried this dish here. It's definitely better than what I've had from the south. Then there's the braised oxtail. I've had a similar dish from a booshie restaurant in San Francisco. This,, is oh so much better than that. Then a slice of sweet potato cheese cake for the grand finale. YAAAAAAASSSS!!!Btw,, the service is top tier. Very engaging and clearly knows the menu like the back of her hand.I love you SavannahBlue. You are definitely Detroit Cuisine at its finest."
4/7/2016,4 star rating,"Who knew Detroit had a Times Square?  Well, it does, and it's the locale of the new, upscale, soul-food restaurant SavannahBlue.  Enter through the deep set door at 1431 Times Square and ascend the stairs to find yourself in a whitewashed-brick and dark wood bar area that includes inviting lounge seating.  Walk through the bar toward the back to enter the dining area, also exposed brick and dark colors, with attractive, leatherette tables, comfortable molded composite chairs and expansive views of the peoplemover across the street.  Service from Ricky was top-notch from beginning to end.  His friendly, knowledgeable vibe enhanced the experience.  Talking with chef Chris McClendon also enhanced the experience, as he revealed his curatorial approach to developing wait staff talent as well as his menu.  For appetizers, our table of three shared black-eyed pea hummus and chicken wings with molasses BBQ.  We agreed that both were outstanding.  The hummus highlighted the nice earthy taste of black-eyed peas while managing to stay perfectly hummus-y.  The wings were deep fried to a crispy perfection, and the molasses BBQ, with its sweet, smoky taste, perfectly complemented them.For entrees, we chose shrimp and grits, the SavannahBlue burger, and braised oxtail.  All were excellent.  The andouille sausage in the shrimp and grits was smoky and flavorful without being overly spicy.  The grits were suffused with, but not overpowered by, parmesan.  And the shrimp was flawlessly prepared.  The burger was meticulously grilled to the requested temperature - medium - and you could taste the high quality in the brisket that was used to make the ground beef.  Shoe string potatoes were fried to a lovely crisp.  But the braised oxtail was the real star of the show.  Juicy, tender meat fell off the bone onto a bed of cheddar risotto.  Instead of green beans, my dining companion chose sweet potato puree, and it was mouth-watering.  I suspect it was infused with some of the molasses BBQ sauce that was so successful with the wings.For dessert, we chose banana fosters bread pudding accompanied by coffee.  The bread pudding, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, was good but not great.  The bananas seemed somehow to compete against the rest of the flavors instead of enhancing or merging with them.  This is the reason I'm giving SavannahBlue 4 instead of 5 stars.On this night, we didn't have cocktails, but the menu looks interesting.  I can't wait to go back!  I expect my next visit will be 5 stars, since SavannahBlue is hitting on all cylinders already after only a few months of operation."
9/25/2019,1 star rating,"Really, really, really, really bad service!!!!!!!!Put yourself in this scenario: It's a Friday evening, you leave your car at the office downtown and walk over to SavannahBlue, because some people from the office are gathered there. Now, SavannahBlue has nearly zero street appeal. It's tucked behind the bus terminal and under the People Mover with a small sign. I finally get there and an older man dressed to the 9s side steps in between me and the door and says ""Do you have a reservation?""No ""Hello.""No ""How are you?""No ""Welcome to SavannahBlue.""No ""Come on inside and wait for a seat to open up.""There is an inside waiting area. But for some reason this older man felt it was necessary for potential patrons to wait outside in a poorly lit alley. Big hard pass. My pocked linned with $400, my debit and credit card doesn't feel like waiting outside in a Detroit alley.They can try to portray a smug sense of self-importance by keeping half a dozen people waiting outside for its own curb appeal, but the restaurant itself is not even nice. I've been. I just wanted to meet some friends after work. Instead I spent my money somewhere more appreciative.No I don't have a reservation. But I know when I'm not welcomed!!!!!"
7/25/2019,5 star rating,"Excellent soul food and service!  Probably the best souls food experience I've ever had!  The menu is traditional yet creative with things like the Georgian Hummus made with black eyed peas.  I had the oxtails and mist say they were excellent.  The Yukon garlic smashed potatoes were on point as well!  My wife had the catfish with yams and greens and my taste of her plate was nothing short of amazing!  Ask for Jasmin,  her service was with a smile every time she came to the table and that helped to lift the mood!  The environment is mad chill with the right level of music and the drink menu was very creative and delicious as well!A must visit if you live or are visiting Detroit!"

We had the chicken and waffles, loaded grits with catfish, fresh fruit, and biscuits and gravy. Oh, the tropical mojito was delicious!

7/1/2019,4 star rating,"SavannahBlue came strongly recommended to us. So we decided to come for our anniversary. With a 7pm reservation, we were quickly seated. It is located upstairs. The place was quaint. There is a nice lounge/bar area. The actual seating area can seat  approximately 50 patrons or so. (It would be a nice place to rent out for a party or event).ProsService: Jasmine was our server. She was nice and attentive to our needs. No complaints whatsoever. Food: We ordered the braised oxtails and catfish with fries and asparagus which was the seasonal vegetable. The braised oxtails were tender and delightful. The cheddar risotto and greens were good. The collard greens had more of vinegary flavor to them. The catfish was generous and came with 3 fillets. The fries were hand cut and the asparagus was crisp, not too soft. Jasmine was on it in asking if there is anything we needed. She kindly filled the request of remoulade sauce for the catfish. It was good and flavorful. Cons-I'm being particular and picky.The dinner and drink menus were dirty. The floor under our table hadn't been swept. Lastly, for it to be noted in reservation that it was our anniversary, but no acknowledgement was made upon arrival or during dinner. Some restaurants give an anniversary dessert. Not to say I was expecting that, but just some sort acknowledgement would've been nice. Overall, I would come again. The food and service is solid. There are other entrees we'd like to try."
4/23/2019,1 star rating,"I'm so disappointed. I was looking forward to coming here for a few months and I finally had the opportunity to try it Sunday before Tyler Perry's show at the Fox. Well, ""try""...It started off with my friend and I being seated for our 545 reservation. We were promptly served beverages and told that someone would come by to take our order. Now, I know it was a busy day for them being Easter and all but we waited over 30 minutes and no one took our order! Even worse, 2 couples were seated after us and they had their order taken!!!We left around 6:25p cause it was pointless at that point with the show starting at 730. Needless to say I don't know when or if I will ever give them another chance"
4/22/2018,5 star rating,"We hit a home run tonight.  In town to go to a concert and wanted to eat at a fun, cool, trendy restaurant.  We checked out the options.  There were many, but the name SavannahBlue, and its description sounds too good to pass up.  Clearly we are smart people.You walk upstairs into a comfortable yet chic waiting area with beautiful lighting and great ambience. The dining area is just perfect.  Super casual seating, great lighting also as we were seated by the window.  The food... so, so good.  At first I would say I liked my seafood chowder.  Then I tried it with the cornbread, and I really, really liked it.  The jumbo crab cake was nothing short of phenomenal.  Seriously, it's a must on the menu.  I followed that up with the Braised Oxtail with Risotto.  If I'm being honest, it was fattier than I expected.  Keep in mind I know nothing about eating oxtail. The flavor was superb.  The GM popped over to see how we were doing, and I wasn't going to mention the oxtail because everything was so good.  But I did and he was exceptional.  He immediately offered to get me another.  He was so gracious and didn't make me feel awkward about bringing it up.  Next time, I will get what my friend got, the seared salmon.  That meal was amazing.  Too full to go on, because the portions were generous, we went ahead and got dessert.  Coffee and bananas foster.  Oh yeah.  Finally I want to shout out to our waiter.  Byron was the best part of an already fantastic experience.  Because that's what this place was.  Not just a meal, an experience to enjoy and remember for a long, long time.  So next time you find yourself in Detroit, I highly recommend this place.  And if nothing else, get the crab cake and ask for Byron."

4/15/2019,5 star rating,"In my top 5 soul food restaurants across the US and this is a BOLD STATEMENT.  The food is fresh the service is great the environment is a vibe. I would recommend you come and get the chicken Breast meal it comes with greens, man n cheese and yams. There corn bread is also very delicious. My boyfriend and I came back two days later to try there breakfast.THE PEACH COBBLER FRENCH TOAST!!!!! I have no words. NONE. Hands down the best if not the top 1 stop for French toast. It melts in your mouth I'm not kidding.  Try it out and see for yourself. I'm a realist and take pride in my reviews. Let me know what you think!"
8/5/2019,4 star rating,"This is my second visit to SavannahBlue. My first visit was in December 2017 and it was cold as hell in the D! The restaurant has a cool factor to it with artwork on the walls and dope music playing in the background. On my first  visit I tried the Shrimp and Grits and I knew if I ever came back I would not leave Detroit without going back to SavannahBlue! This time I tried the Whole Fried Red Snapper. OMG it was amazing!!! Presentation matters and my dish delivered. It was so cool I hesitated digging in. Once I did I was determined to finish the entire meal. It was seasoned to perfection, no hot sauce was needed. The fish was accompanied by a creole rice dish that was very good as well. My wife had the fried chicken meal with mac and cheese, greens and sweet potatoes. I tasted it all and it was BOMB! I did not rate this experience as five stars due to lack of attention from our waiter. We had to have another waiter find him to replenish our drinks. Also, please be advised that this restaurant is not handicapped accessible. You have to walk up a flight of stairs to access it. I will definitely visit SavannahBlue upon my return to Detroit."
12/31/2017,5 star rating,I enjoyed my dining experience at this place. Ordered catfish fritters and crab cake to start. We were going to just eat a quick bite and head out but it was so good we decided to stay and get more. Ox tails and fried chicken. Very impressed with everything about this place.

The shrimp and grits is mouthwatering and I will be back specifically for that. Also had the garlic mashed potatoes and collard greens. Everything was delicious.Only negative is there is no free parking, Lot behind restaurant is seven dollars. Also, you must go up two flights of steps to get into the restaurant. This was a bit tough on my mom"
7/25/2019,5 star rating,This spot was amazing! Extremely flavorful and well cooked. Definitely recommend this spot when coming to Detroit. You will not regret it!!
10/15/2017,5 star rating,"Me and my dad went for Restaurant Week recently.  I had studied the menu prior to going so I already had an idea of what to order.  After going back and forth, I made a decision.  For an appetizer, we ended up ordering the black eyed-pea hummus with buttered pita triangles.  And boy, was it yummy!  We kept asking for more pita bread.  For the entree, I ended up going with the oxtails with risotto topped with greens.  My dad opted for the seafood chowder, the fried chicken with a maple dipping syrup, sweet potatoes, and greens.  And all the food came with some delicious honey cornbread.  All the food was amazing!  The chef did an wonderful job!  We have no complaints.  I will definitely be back!  And my dad has been back at least twice since we've gone."
10/6/2019,5 star rating,"This was my first time here. We were greeted by a gentleman at the door who allowed us to park right in front. The hostess was friendly as well. We enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. The food was delicious. Started with the crab cake appetizer, one of the best I've ever had. I chose the oxtail with cheesy risotto. I had a choice between asparagus or roasted carrots. I chose the roasted carrots. The meal was delicious and I plan to visit again"
3/16/2019,1 star rating,"Honestly This used to be my spot 2-3 times a week. However lately I have been very disappointed in both the service and quality of food. Which is a shame as the menu has so much potential. Also, what's up with the change in beignets?  Used to be paired with an amazing berry compote, now I'm getting some peach cobbler type thing. Not a fan. Why ruin something that was so good. I'm sitting at the bar in Savannah blue as I write this review and have waited 20 minutes so far with an empty glass waiting to be refilled. My dinner was terrible. I had them take it back with only 2 bites ate out of it and still had to pay for it. Where's the management ? I told the server I couldn't eat it and had her take it back. Isn't that something management should be made aware of?There's must be a reason why this place used to have a wait and now I can walk in at anytime. You seem to have lost a lot of your patrons."
4/26/2019,4 star rating,"Trendy, dim lighted, causal to dressy. Great for a date night & good for a chill kick back with a few friends. I wouldn't bring my kid. Reservation required. The parking lot is $7 so we parked on the street $2 for 2 hours. We passed the front door at first, then you walk up some stairs. On a Thursday it wasn't crazy busy. Nice hostess to greet you. Soul food inspired menu. The Jambalaya was excellent a good spicy and different as they don't use traditional rice. The fried chicken entree was good/safe, but I would encourage you to try something less typical from the menu. That lemonade and sweet tea, babbbby! So good! Our waitress Jasmine was attentive and helpful. My only negative, the cocktail menu didn't have many fruity type drinks but that's personal preference as I am not a whiskey or cognac drinker. We would return."
2/15/2019,3 star rating,"The food was good. I had the fried chicken (which oddly resembled a pork chop) meal, with yams and greens. My friend enjoyed their shrimp and grits...said it was even tastier as leftovers the next day.The service left much to be desired. The women taking coats were good, but we sat serverless for 10 minutes. I had to eventually be 'that guy' and grab one of the women repeatedly walking past our table. She said she wasn't out waitress, but served us from that point forward. She was unattentive at best. At some point, a tall man who Im assuming was mgmt came to our table to briefly apologize. Felt like he almost had a script. Yikes.I'd say get carry out-sitting at the bar may also be fine."
1/3/2019,5 star rating,"My All Time FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN DETROIT!!!!! Savannah Blue is a restaurant I hold close to my heart! They earn all 5 stars  every single time! My husband and I have Dined at SavannahBlue for birthdays, anniversaries and they never disappoint! The food is impeccable, so fresh and the menu is so diverse! I'll share my favorite dishes and I can say that honestly have tried almost the whole menu! Hands down for an appetizer you MUST try the Georgian Hummus:Black eyed pea puree, crispy peas served with garlic flatbread!!!!!!!!! AMAZING, you will thank me later! All their appetizers are great but by far the Georgian Hummus is my favorite appetizer dish on the menu! For a main dish, the Braised Oxtail with Cheddar risotto, crispy root seasonal vegetable is mouth watering. The oxtail is cooked to perfection and falls off the bone! The staff is professional and the atmosphere at SavannahBlue is classy and elegant with a grand piano in the dining/ bar area and they have separate intimate dining experience with an amazing view from of downtown Detroit!!! Every time I visit Detroit, SavannahBlue is a must! How did I forget to mention the yummy honey cornbread!"

Glad I did....very cool/relaxed spot; tucked away on Time Square!....the lighting, atmosphere and even the music hinted in the back-ground was perfect!!Ordered the Catfish Fritters; served with an amazing smoke-pepper ramoulade sauce! Deleesh!! Along with the SB chopped salads! All Great choices...!Enjoyed glasses of their speciality wines; the Stelling di Notte; Pinot Grigio and Concundrum Red...very nice HOUSE selections. Bravo to the Red blend of the evening! (Will be looking for this Red, to add to my sipping collection). And from the chill and sips; her Pinot was enjoyed too....!Very impressive dining experience ......really, nice cool spot...I will be back to try my originally planned to order; Shrimp and Grits. But till next time."

12/12/2018,2 star rating,"After a very bumpy evening dinning here, and a very upset stomach, I am weary of the multiple great reviews here.To preface this review we dined here on a Wednesday evening with a party of four, a $200+ bill, and no reservation.Starting with check in, the hostess kindly made us feel out of place with no reservation.  We understand the need for this when the restaurant is full,  but on this evening they appeared to be operating at half capacity.  Regardless we asked to sit at the bar we were told we were not able to be served there.  We were then escorted to couches, sat there for only one min, and were then escorted to the table.After being seated the service was sketchy.  We were missing drinks until after appetizers, and even the entrees arrived.  We had to repeatedly ask for water glasses to be filled, and when pouring wine the waitress mixed up glasses.  Not that big of a deal, but as this was a work dinner it was a bit awkward. Now the real heartbreaker of the story is that the food left three out of four of us feeling ill within hours of leaving the restaurant.  All of the ill patrons had eaten the salmon,  and thought it had tasted a bit off during dinner.  Non of us were able to finish our meals due to ill feelings, overly rich sauces, or pour selection in ingredients.  As the evening progressed we realized that we should have said something and maybe sent some food back as we started to feel ill.Regardless of the slight bits of food sickness, the food was bland and basic.  The service made us feel awkward or abandoned, and was a big disappointment. With so many great restaurants in Detroit it is difficult to see the appeal of dinning here."
4/13/2019,5 star rating,It is always a good time here! The food is always excellent. Today was my anniversary and once the staff knew they all came by to say congratulations!  This was the sweetest thing ever. Small acts of hospitality is why this place will always have my coins!
11/4/2017,4 star rating,"If you don't get the crab cakes you're completely wasting your time here! It's the best thing on the menu. You can either get a jumbo crab cake appetizer or you can get it as a meal; either way you won't be disappointed. The service is great at the bar (only place I've sat) and the environment is always beautiful. Also, if you're trying to book an event or large party, they don't respond well. Note: Every time I go I always slip on their floor! I'm not sure what's up with that and I'm not THAT clumsy!"
1/30/2019,5 star rating,"What an amazing, upscale and sultry soul food restaurant! I ordered the oxtails and macaroni and cheese. The oxtails were seasoned to perfection and the meat fell right off the bone. So tender. I was also able to sample my neighbors collard greens and crab cakes those were both delicious as well. Definitely worth checking out if you're ever in Detroit."
3/17/2020,5 star rating,"The catfish is out of site, as are the cocktails! Definitely worth spending an evening!"
3/8/2019,3 star rating,So today I decided to try this restaurant.  The restaurant isn't bad. Reservations is highly suggested or you'll end up sitting in the bar area. We also had someone that was handicap with us. They were  not really accommodating for us.  I feel the drinks are  a bit overpriced as well.
3/16/2019,5 star rating,"The food is amazing! The service was excellent, everyone was very nice from the minute we walked in. The cornbread is the best iv ever had, it's a must have and the bread pudding was also amazing!"
2/23/2019,5 star rating,"Great spot, especially for some late night eats. Kitchen stays open until midnight, which is clutch for getting some food in your stomach before a night out in the city. The menu offers a good variety of appetizers and entrees, ideal for sharing family style. For sides, the mac and cheese wins. Collard greens uses turkey instead of pork, and it's amazing. Generous portions sides. My recommendations would be the shrimp and grits, catfish, and the fried chicken. I will say that I do wish the corn bread was a bit better because it was less than Jiffy-average. They have coat check along with a bar and open seating for a cool, casual setting. Then in the back they have more open dining seating that's a bit more intimate and vibey- good romantic date night spot or cute girls night out dinner spot. Your pick. I could come here and dine alone because the food is worth it. #noshame #putsomebutteronthatcornbread #supportlocalbizness"
3/30/2019,5 star rating,"Catfish fritters..appetizer....YUM!!! The sauce that comes with it was perfect.The Oxtail was sooooo good with asparagus. That's what my friend got. I got the buttermilk chicken with greens, roasted carrots and the dipping sauce for the chicken. You have to try this!!Great astmosphere!!!! Definitely great for date night.Oh the dessert....devine!!!! Beignets with a glaze. 5 star. Was not disappointed at all."
12/27/2018,3 star rating,"Made a trip to the D from Columbus, OH to see my Forever FLOTUS on her Becoming Book Tour. Made a reservation about 2 weeks prior to the trip to have dinner before the show. First off, the restaurant is located on a dead in street, we noticed a door to enter, however it did not list ""Entrance"" nor did we see people inside. Upon open the door, we notice steps on our right side that lead up *insert blank face* and finally someone who works there walks by and advises us to go up for the restaurant. We get checked in & advise we have a reservation...hostess looks confused and ask that we stand in the lounge area to be seated shortly.  There is a seating area in the ""lounge"" area with a large community type table and two additional tables off to the far wall and a bar area. After about a 30 min wait, yes THIRTY MINUTES I ask the hostess how long before we'll be seated again as the reservation was for 6 and she placed us in the lounge area, again she looks confused and looks down at her tablet, here we go *insert heavy sigh* The hostess talks to a young man in a suit clearing tables, they seem to be short staffed or over booked, I'm not really sure, he's on a cell phone and walks over & ask if we had a reservation *insert another blank stare* me: yes, for 6pm, shows the confirmation email from Open Table. He was very apologetic and stated he would seat us right away. We were seated at one of the tables by the wall in the lounge area, never got a glance of the dining room area. My friend & I both ordered the same meal, catfish, greens w/ mac & cheese, we also had the chicken wings as an app. The catfish was friend very well, I like my greens with less stems and cooked down a little more but thats b/c my mother taken hours to make her greens, but they were good. The mac & cheese was not my fav, you get a healthy portion, but it wasn't anything to write home about. But baby, that cornbread is a yes and more please!!! Please note on the menu, they advise that carbonated drinks are only refilled ONCE for free. Our serve was one of the bartenders, she gave great suggestions regarding the meal, however, she never came back to the table to collect our payment, so my friend had to go to the bar to pay. Some lines of communication may have been crossed re reservations, however I hope they do well here and make some small changes, I would definitely give thus place another try if back in Detroit and maybe i'll get a seat in the actual dinning room."

2/23/2019,5 star rating,"My wife and I were in Detroit for a show at the Fox Theater and walked over to Savannah blue. When we arrived at the desk, they asked if we had reservations because this is clearly a popular place. We did not, but we're sat at a bar area table within about five minutes. We happened to be there during restaurant week, but opted to order off the regular menu. We chose the Manhattan seafood chowder, Georgian hummus (black eyed peas!), Jambalaya, and whole friend red snapper. Everything we ate was delicious! Cooked and season perfectly. The portions were a great size and my wife even took home some of the rice from her fish dish. This place will not disappoint but be forewarned that it is not a cheap eats place. Our food and two glasses of wine were $95. We would return!"
2/1/2020,4 star rating,Went last night. Ambiance is very cool. The food was overall very good. Hubby got the ribs which were outstanding. My oxtail was a little tough and gristly. Mac and cheese and polenta were excellent. Drinks were good. I would definitely recommend it!

6/7/2019,5 star rating,"We chose this restaurant based on Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed.  We arrived at 330pm which was 1/2 hr before opening. The manager turned on the grill and had his staff set a table for us.  Great service. Not many places would do that. The waitress gave us recommendations which we ordered.  They were excellent.  The catfish fingers are a must. Delicately breaded, crisp, with no fishy aftertaste.  The shrimp and grits were superb as were the buttermilk fried chicken and St. Louis ribs. Sides were unusual.  The candied yams are a must try. Could be desert  We also had a bottle of malbec which paired wonderfully with everything. It had tones of tart cherry, raspberries and lemon.  Tart but light.  This restaurant deserves 5 stars"
4/16/2019,2 star rating,"The food was okay. Not great. The yams are gross mine looked like a baby food, my cousins looked a lot better. I did like the wings and the sauce that come with it. The cornbread was a little dry. The fried chicken was good."

10/22/2017,4 star rating,"This place is like a little hidden treasure in downtown Detroit. We had just finished a class and were originally supposed to be somewhere else for dinner, however the other place was overbooked. We were able to make reservations and arrive and be seated when we planned. The menu options were great and so were the drink options. We had a party of seven. I opted for the ox tails With spinach and risotto. The risotto was cooked perfectly. The spinach was also pretty good however they were such a small amount on top of the ox tails. I felt like I needed more because There were really only about two bites, So I don't know how it was considered a side.The drink I opted for was a long island iced tea. It was rather water down.Overall, we had a pretty good experience, good conversation and a good atmosphere."
1/11/2020,5 star rating,"Great food, great atmosphere! I had the oxtail and it did not disappoint. I went there with a group after a football game, and the service was great. Only thing I would recommend is that the beef up the beer and cocktail selection."
1/17/2019,3 star rating,"Made a reservation through Open Table- I'm a big fan anywhere I can make a reservation!  Went on a Tuesday and it wasn't crowded so we were able to get seated immediately.  The space was really cool, it was upstairs and had 2 separate areas.  An open area with bar and some small tables and piano and then a dining room.  The dining room did seem a little cramped and noisy, I had a hard time hearing the people at my table (I'm also kind of weird about acoustics in restaurants).  It was kind of upscale and we felt a little out of place, we stopped in on our way to the Red Wings game and people were clearly there for date night and dressed up or out on business dinners.  They only had a few beer choices, it definitely seemed like more of a wine place.  We ordered crab cakes as a starter, they were described as ""excellent"" by my crab cake connoisseur fiance.  The dinner portion was large enough for 3 of us to split.  Could have easily ordered 1 crab cake per person as an app!  We each ordered a different entree, jambalaya, shrimp & grits, and catfish.  I had the jambalaya and it was definitely not like any other I had before.  In my book I wouldn't call it jambalaya but it was still very good and filling!  The catfish was good and came with 2 different sides so good portion of food.  The shrimp and grits was winner of the night!  My friend saw many other patrons order it so he had to get it and we all tried it.  Had great flavor and very filling!  He couldn't even finish it all."
12/14/2018,4 star rating,"I have to give this place 4 stars only because they are not handicap accessible which means not everyone can enjoy the wonderful food. I'm not sure how this passed city inspection. But now on to the amazing food I ate!! I have celiac disease which means I can't eat anything with wheat, barley, rye and anything that contains gluten. Their dry rubbed wings are out of this world. They serve it with a smokey BBQ sauce which I didn't even have to use because these wings need nothing! For dinner I got the shrimp and grits. They assured me the ""gravy"" wasn't really gravy. It was amazing!!!!! Shrimps are cooked just right, the sauce has a kick to it and there is sausage and pure yumminess in every bite!You won't be disappointed!"
11/2/2019,5 star rating,Amazing if you're looking for some upscale soul food. Their drinks are quite good as well. Highly recommend making a reservation.
11/12/2019,4 star rating,"I had this place on my list to visit for a very long time. I must say that I'm glad I finally ate here. I made reservations for two seated by the window, nice warm welcome from the waiter. I ordered a Manhattan that was on point. Catfish Mac n cheese, greens, corn bread was good. Only downside is that that my wife went to the ladies room and came back disappointed. So if management is reading this review, you guys gotta take more care in keeping the ladies room clean. Other than the restroom this place cool."
8/23/2018,5 star rating,"Two words...Braised Oxtails! OMG!  I nearly fell out with the first bite. Did I mention the cheddar risotto and garlic roaster asparagus? Wait...I'm getting ahead of myself. When my sister-friend suggested we have dinner at Savannah Blue, I said, ""Yes"" and we were not disappointed. Each dish that our waiter (Byron ) brought to us was received with sheer delight. The jumbo crab cake and cat fish fritters had us snacking our lips. Oh, and that sauce! I tried to keep it classy.  But I am a true Foodie and I get real excited about a good meal. All of it was scrumptious! And, I was nearly humming inside when I took a sip of my pear martini. The location, the vibe, the decor and THAT piano! Classy, chic and casual all at the same time. It's an intimate place to just be and connect. Loved the couch, the bar and the pictures!  In true Oprah form, I've told all my friends about Savannah Blue. We coming back for Brunch!  Thank you!"

11/12/2018,5 star rating,"I dined here yesterday and the experience was, in a word, great. It wasn't just that the food was good and very well priced, nor was it just that the dining room is lovely and very comfortable, it was that the service was so, so, so good. The warmth and attentiveness of everyone from the hostess, to the coat checker, to the wait staff in the dining room was just great. An extra added bonus was the clientele who were very friendly and way swank. I mean, I thought I was dressed just fine for lunch, but the other diners were seriously bringing it, and I don't mean by wearing business suits and ties. We're talking fashion here.The Georgian humus turned out to be a real surprise. It was terrific. Catfish fritters were also very good, as was the seafood stew. I was with others who'd already eaten to keep their mouths empty for business talk, but I will eat with my mouth full so...just great. I'll definitely return when back in Detroit."
7/15/2017,3 star rating,"Soooo many great reviews, makes me sad to give a three. I dined at savannah today 7-15-2017 based on all the great reviews especially the reviews of the mac-n-cheese..... a big disappointment on the mac I knew something was off when i received my plate since all of the pics showed the Mac served sliced in a square..... I wish I took pics but as usual I forgot plus I left my phone at home‍ but the Mac I had was runny and bland. I ordered the jumbo crab cake entree by the way. The crab was awesome which is why I gave a three... that and it's a nice place plus the drinks even tho pricey were strong. Well to me lol I'm not the best judge of that so I've heard. I hope they get that Mac together tho. I willing to give them another go tho I won't let a bad Mac experience keep me from trying the rest of the menu. Please enjoy the pick of my left overs lol"
8/24/2016,5 star rating,First of all i walked right past the front door. Its on the 2nd floor of a warehouse painted all blue. Loves the decor. Detroit has mastered these type of soul food spits better than anyone else in rhe country.Food was a delight. Check put my pics ...oxtails seasoned perfectly. Server nailed this one. Green beans were sauteed and cooked perfectly. Still had the snap in em. All over a chessy risotto.....oh yes and corn bread....lol was i wrong fir picking up the bone and finishing it like i did growing up I THINK NOT!!  lol
8/3/2018,5 star rating,"First of all... I selected this because it is labelled as ""vegetarian friendly"" which I'd say is not true.  There are zero vegetarian entrees on the menu.  Like any restaurant, you can order vegetarian side dishes or special order entrees with meat removed but I'd say it's misleading to call it VF.  Second, the appearance from the outside is not very impressive but borderline sketchy.  I was completely comfortable there but I could see how someone else may not have been.  We had to park in a tight lot for $7 and walk halfway around the building to enter.  I would tell people not to be dissuaded by this.  It's also on the second floor and although I did not see an elevator, I assume there should be one.  If you can't climb the stairs you should find out ahead of time what to do.Aside from those two issues, the place was outstanding.  It was clean, well-decorated, nice ambience, pleasant crowd, friendly hosts and servers, cotton tablecloths and napkins, decent pours on the cocktails. Our server was Byron; he was super professional, friendly and knowledgable about the menu...and fun.  The prices are very reasonable as the food and experience were much like a fine dining restaurant. It is a bit loud. The cuisine is really soul food with a northern twist which I didn't realize before arriving.  Although they have a few mainstream dishes most of the menu is not the usual meat and potatoes.  Nice variety and everything we had was absolutely delicious."
10/13/2018,3 star rating,Solid southern restaurant in downtown Detroit. Really cool location with a cool vibe. Food was good without being great. Service was adequate but not incredible. Really cool cocktail list though!
10/13/2018,5 star rating,"The ambiance in this place is amazing! You enter through up some steps greeted by beautiful hostess. Just past the bar is a piano that helps to capture the mood of a late night dinner filled with love and cultural appreciation. The food was absolutely amazing! My friends and I shared a Devine crab cake that came with a Cajun remoulade that was perfect. I ordered the fried chicken with collards and Mac! Tasted just like home,maybe even better, sorry mom. My friends ordered the salmon and rib dinner. The food was sooooo good that I wanted to order more to take back to Indy! Detroit definitely has some really amazing food spots.SavannahBlue is a must! Just remember to book ahead."
8/12/2018,1 star rating,"This is based on service alone. I did not get an opportunity to try the food as my review will make clear shortly.We arrived at the restaurant at 14:00 and were told dining would not start until 14:30. We were a party of 5, with 2 kids. We were offered the lounge area that catered to walk-ins. At 14:45 we had not heard anything from the hostess. At which point I went to inquire on our table. The hostess said she'd get back to us shortly.At 14:50 she walked up with what appeared to be a manager who informed us that we could not be seated at the bar area because we had 2 kids with us, and that he could not seat us in the dining area as he had a reservation for 15:45 and had to honor it.Why make us wait for 45 minutes only to turn us away. The kids were with us the whole time. If this was an issue why didn't the hostess make it known when we walked in?"

The vibe is laid-back, chic. Nice evening ambience, even for the traveler dressed in shorts and converse. This is added to my must visit again travel list. The complimentary cornbread was just like grandma's. The SB Chowder and Shrimp and Grits was waaaayyy too much for one person but glad I tried them both.Will definitely go back and recommend."

9/30/2018,5 star rating,"Whoa! Support this restaurant! This was seriously great food, quality service, and amazing atmosphere. Soul through and through! Everything! App - Georgian Hummus!!! I could eat that everyday. For entree I got the Oxtail and Cheddar Risotto, Collard Greens, and Yams. Seriously it was like Christmas! We tried all 3 deserts! Loved them. I left so stuffed but so grateful we went there. I will be back!"
5/27/2018,5 star rating,"I can honestly say that nobody in my party had one single complaint about anything. The entire experience was phenomenal and if there are any regrets it's that this swanky joint has been open since 2016 and this was everyone's first time here (but not last!).  The lounge area is very nice with a baby grand piano in the corner and smooth jazz on the sound system. Would be a great place to grab a drink and hang out with friends.  We were equally impressed with the dining area with the exposed brick wall and comfortable seating.  But the star of the show is the food and the wonderful service. Seriously, we are talking about water glasses constantly being refilled, excellent menu suggestions, pride in the restaurant itself and a genuine desire to help guests have the best experience possible.  And the food.... Everything was delicious. We started with the black eyed pea hummus, unique and delicious. I had the crab cakes which were amazing. No filler... perfect sear for a bit of crunch.  The macaroni and cheese is legit!  Also had at our table was the jumbalaya, the shrimp and grits and the oxtail. Oh and don't forget about the delicious corn bread served complimentary.  Even though we were stuffed the bread pudding and beignets were also devoured.  I cannot wait to go back. And soon.  There's still that wonderful fried chicken to try!!"
7/17/2018,2 star rating,"Ok my peeps, I finally went to SavannahBlue it was ok. I wanted it to be great, it just wasn't. Maybe it's because I eat this type of food all the time. So the good. ""Great Atmosphere, Great Decor, staff was very nice."" the bad... well not bad just not great, the food was just ok, funny my mac and cheese was just out of the oven (+) had the pan mold corner.. yep the aluminum pan mold, like the 'family reunion'. Another thing i had the Apple crisp or crumble, some apples were cooked, some were not.. uneven is the word. The Ugly... i noticed the kitchen staff kept coming out of the kitchen cruising the dining area, drinking out of what seemed to be a water bottle? Perfectly fine if i didn't wonder 'I guess he's waiting for the mac & cheese to cook through'  I think the restaurant is stuck betwn being upscale and down home."
9/20/2019,5 star rating,Loved this place! The ambiance is so welcoming and lets you have a relaxed meal and allows for conversations with a very enjoyable jazz/blues music in the background. I had the wine which was good and my friends liked the cocktails as well. But the star of the evening was the food. It was one of the most delicious meals I have had in a long time. The meat was perfectly cooked and the seasoning hit the right spot!
9/29/2018,5 star rating,"If you've never been to SavannahBlue you should smack yourself. The food is excellent, our server was knowledgeable and friendly. My husband and I enjoyed the ambiance and decor, but more so then that; the food, wine and cocktails are outstanding. I enjoyed the braised oxtails with risotto and collards (my mouth is salivating just thinking about it) and my husband enjoyed the shrimp and grits (the creamiest grits I've ever had). Do yourself a favor and go to SavannahBlue, you won't regret it!"
9/28/2019,1 star rating,Doesn't say anything about a dress code on the website. Wasn't aloud to walk into the restaurant. Stood outside waiting for a car and watch people come out the restaurant with sportier clothing then what I was wearing. Doorman needs a lesion in fashion.
7/11/2017,4 star rating,"For our anniversary, this was a good pick.  The oxtails were tender and flavorful topped with greens and fried banana crisp, risotto on bottom.  The salmon was thick and moist just as we were hoping.  The greens are lightly seasoned to a good taste but the Mac and Cheese is on the strong cheddar side or so, but okay. Small menu selection (website menu) but enough intrigued to give it a go.  We were pleasantly full at the end. The service was pretty awesome all around. We even had a few laughs with the waiter about using facebook vs. snapchat and instagram???  Am I giving away our age.  But the crowd was mixed with all ages and smiling people. The atmosphere is nice as well.  We did not feel crowded at the table, the music was enough that we could hear each other without yelling and a good room temperature although subjective I'm sure..    The missing 1 star: Small hiccups although the manager and the staff took care of what they could in a flash in a very professional manner. Hats off for that.  The other:  a tasty but very expensive crab cake ball, creative but girly presented and expensive whisky sour. Lastly, the manager acknowledged our anniversary making my wife was shocked and happy. Good job for the raising the bar in professionalism and tasty food in the city."
5/4/2016,4 star rating,"Savannah Blue had a sexy, dark and sultry vibe, from the decor to the music. This place was a great date spot. Feel free to dress casual or get a little spiffy. The atmosphere is classy, and the front bar/lounge area felt was so attractive. I got there pretty late, so I wasn't able to order as much food as I wanted to. I ordered a crab cake, and it was meaty. I don't like crab cakes that skimp on crab, that's not the case at Savannah Blue. I also had a lemon drop that was super strong. My bartender was brand new, but she was sweet as ever. And it wasn't just her newness that made her so friendly, apparently, friendly service is a ""thing"" here. Savannah Blue servers and staff seemed like they knew all the customers personally.  Want to have a sexy night in the city with friends or a boo/bae/lover? Savannah Blue is a good choice for that.The only thing that may turn people off here is that SB is on the second floor of the building and that you may have to pay for parking."
7/27/2016,4 star rating,"I'll keep this one short and sweet. The food is great but expensive. Also I thought the portions were a bit small for the price. I think it is better than Beans and Cornbread in Southfield. That said; I don't feel like I need to eat there again. However, the bar looks very nice as well. So, I would not be averse to going back for drinks and possibly more cornbread."
7/3/2019,4 star rating,"Took out of town friends here recently. I've been several times before and always enjoy it. The oxtail = PERFECTION. But this particular night, the restaurant had some type of electrical issue during dinner (which, I should note, was amazing and filled with great service - they didnt miss a beat). This did not stop the food or drinks from flowing, but once we ended our meal, we were informed they could only accept cash and if we didnt have cash, we didnt need to pay. Of course we dont carry much cash in 2019, and we were stunned that the meal was on Savannah Blue (rather than forcing us to go to an atm). THIS is top notch customer service and will keep customers coming back. We put all our cash money together (which wouldnt make a dent in the bill) and left it as a tip. I already highly recommend this place, but after this, they forever have my business. Try the oxtail, shrimp and grits (my friend commented it was the best she ever had in life) or fried chicken."
8/22/2018,4 star rating,I went late at night because I work a late shift so I wasn't expecting food to be the best even though it was my first time coming! And to my surprise the whole vibe was great and the food matched. I will be coming back! Classy soulfood is what I call it
6/13/2018,2 star rating,"Writing this from the parking lot I was really looking forward to trying this place during my first trip to Detroit. Unfortunately I was in a medical boot and on crutches my whole trip(don't eeeeeven ask)  STILL I was determined to have their braised oxtail TONIGHT. I couldn't get an answer on the phone so I trusted the hours on their website and hobbled in at 10:30pm and ran into one of the servers who was walking out. I had to find an accessible entrance but there isn't one here :'( and after all that hobbling and alleyway manuveuring with a boot on, the server tells me they're closed anyway ...I'll revisit this review when the ankle pain has minimized and I'm thinking more clearly. I did a whole lot for that damn oxtail"
12/12/2019,3 star rating,"Service was great and the atmosphere was nice. Wasn't too loud or crowded. Perfect for a date. The food wasn't the best (I'm southern, so maybe I'm being picky) the food didn't taste freshly cooked, some things tasted like it was from a can or pre cooked and reheated. I would probably return for the nice atmosphere and a cocktail."
8/30/2019,5 star rating,Hands down one of my all time favorite restaurants in downtown Detroit. I've been on 2 dates here and plan to take my mother when she comes to visit. From the drinks to the ambiance to the awesome service everything is impeccable.

6/28/2018,3 star rating,"I wish there were two categories you can score a restaurant in-service and food quality. I would give FOUR STARS for the food and portions! The catfish, Mac and cheese, and shrimp and grits were DELICIOUS! However...I HAD to take a star for the service. The bartender was our waitress and did the best she could...but it took a LONG TIME to get anything; from drinks to corn bread to appetizers to ordering dinner. Things took a long time...but it WAS delicious.If you want good comfort food-and have time to spare-I would recommend this place!"
3/12/2016,5 star rating,"Loved it! Had to sit at the bar because all the tables were full, but the bartenders learned our names and gave great service.Had an Arnold Palmer (with a generous pour of southern comfort) - not my usual drink but delicious and definitely order-again-worthy. We shared a bacon-ey Cobb salad with these crispy-sweet cornbread croutons and the shrimp and grits (a first for us) and wow!!! If you are in Detroit get here. If your not in Detroit get to Detroit and then get here."

7/12/2019,4 star rating,"I love the ambiance at SavannahBlue. It's perfect for a variety of occasions...date, party, catch up with friends, or family gathering. They have visually stimulating artwork. The music was calming yet entertaining. The waitstaff were very nice and attentive. Our food was delicious and we did not wait long. There was a nice variety of options to chose from. I got the Mac-n-Cheese with the shrimp and grits. Both were very good. I had enough to take home. My friend for the vegetables and Salmon. While he finished his meal at the restaurant he was stuffed afterwards. This is to let you know that you'll have more than enough food. We ordered the beignets for dessert which was a very good choice. When I make it to New Orleans I'll have to let you know how it compares!! I think the prices are appropriate for the type of food they serve but I can see where it could be pricey for others. Nonetheless, I had a good experience and I will be back."
10/4/2020,5 star rating,"First time experiencing this great restaurant! The staff was great from the moment we walked in, our waiter ( I hope I'm saying it right!), Mike, was the nicest, most polite young man to our party as was everyone we encountered. The food was beyond great, I will be back and spreading the word about this establishment!!!"
12/1/2019,5 star rating,"This restaurant was worth every penny! The ambiance was classy with the piano, black walls/ceiling and black/white lounge chairs. The food was amazing, starting with the warm cornbread they brought to the table. Our waitress was attentive, but not overbearing (perfect balance). I had the shrimp and grits, which were seasoned beautifully and cooked well. Everyone one in our party enjoyed our meal and the bread pudding was to die for!! Can't wait to come back on my next business trip to Detroit."
1/25/2019,4 star rating,Very nice spot ! Food was amazing and Jason our server did and outstanding job ! Parking is a lil tricky. But that's everywhere Downtown. This is a hotspot to go for a good southern meal.  Mac & Cheese was delicious!
5/14/2018,2 star rating,"My husband and I along with another couple dined here this past Saturday to celebrate my friend's birthday. I was ready to give this place five stars and tell everyone I knew that they had to try it. All four of our meals were superb, drinks were delicious, and we loved the atmosphere. We also had a wonderful server. The problem came at the end of our night. We had just paid our bill, and all of us were just finishing up our drinks when a hostess approached our table to tell us that we had to get up and leave because there was another reservation waiting for our table. She then proceeded to stand there until we got up from the table. We were all so shocked and taken off guard that we quietly complied.Three of the four of our group have worked as servers and hostesses, and we know that is not how you treat your customers. We were never warned when we made the reservation, nor when we were seated, that there was a time limit on our table. By no means were we ""camping out"" at our table either. We literally had just paid our bill and were just finishing our drinks.As fabulous as the beginning of our evening was, none of us will be returning or recommending to our friends. We've never been treated so rudely at a restaurant."
6/19/2019,5 star rating,"I ordered shrimp and grits and it was absolutely delicious. Everything melted in my mouth, I would highly recommend it if you've never tried that. They also brought us complimentary buttered cornbread which I had a hard time staying away from. Top notch all around. My only complaint was that it was a little loud so you had to basically scream."
11/10/2019,4 star rating,"Solid 4.5. I don't normally post reviews but the food was so delicious that I just had to post a review. We had a 6pm reservation on a Friday night for a party of 4 & were seated promptly. Took awhile to get our drinks (about 15 mins). Our server seemed polite, but distracted. Perhaps they were short staffed. We were going to order an appetizer but passed worrying about making our 8 pm event. We told her we had event tickets & she did seem to pick up the pace from there. Anyhow.....The food made up for it. I had the Shrimp & Grits & my husband had the Jambalaya - both were amazing. We also ordered a side of collard greens to share. We wished we would've each ordered our own. Flavor was amazing, a little too salty, but still fabulous. Our friends had the Chicken & Catfish. They said Chicken was fabulous, I tasted the Catfish myself & it was pretty good, if you like catfish. It's honestly my least favorite fish so I'm probably not the best judge on that anyway. Atmosphere is very cool. I would give 5 stars but the cornbread was very dry & served with nothing to coat it with & it took awhile for our drinks & server was just kind of ""blah"". We will definitely be back though!!  & I'll dream of the shrimp & grits until that next visit... Mmmmmmm"

5/10/2019,5 star rating,"My experience at Savannahblue was one word, amazing! We had a reservation at 4 PM as soon as they opened, they weren't quite ready for us so we had a chance to relax in the lounge area. The atmosphere was fantastic everyone who walked by us asked how we were doing and that music was on point. We sat down and had service immediately. Each course took about 10 minutes to arrive and was hot and fresh. I had a crab cake appetizer that was without a doubt the best crabcake I have ever had. And the shrimp and grits for dinner. Now I consider myself a shrimp and grits connoisseur so trust me when I tell you they were delicious! I took home a piece of sweet potato bread pudding and can't wait to delve into it. I will definitely be back!"
9/8/2018,5 star rating,Great food and service. Chefs REALLY know how to cook soul food. Server didn't ask if we wanted more cocktails. Get that money girl always ask would you like another drink lol.
8/12/2017,4 star rating,"Had dinner here last night. Location isn't the easiest to see from the main roads and the parking is valet only, $10. The lot needs to be redone and cleaned up for such a nice restaurant-it's not the greatest look. Also the entrance could use some sprucing up, it almost looks more like a club than a restaurant. But once inside, this place has a great look and modern decor. Nice bar area with a piano and some lounge style seating. Our server was great-and we didn't wait long for our food. He brought us some cornbread to start which was very good. We ordered the crab cake as a starter. It comes with just one but for two people it's enough. Very generous with the lump crab meat-it was delicious. I had the oxtail which comes on a plate of cheesy risotto and Brussel sprouts-I loved this meal, the meat was tender and flavorful and the risotto was creamy and amazing. For dessert I had the bread pudding, very generous size with a scoop of ice cream. Overall, good experience. Definitely worth trying."
7/17/2018,5 star rating,The food and service was outstanding. Our server Chris was thoughtful and made great recommendations. I tried the ribs which were very tender and delicious. The fried chicken was great. I will do a return visit. Very enjoyable
6/14/2019,5 star rating,"We came to Detroit for two graduations, and took a little time to ourselves before we connected with our family. We went to SavannahBlue restaurant and it was amazing!  Our server, Isaiah, was friendly and efficient, and we were served with smiles!  One of the owners stopped by to chat with us for a bit - incredibly friendly and welcoming. Congratulations to his daughter, by the way, on her way to a top school here in our home state of Illinois. ( not sharing his specific personal business on here ) At any rate, GREAT time here ... excellent and tasty food ... good portions ... flavorful flavorful flavorful!!!!  We got Jambalaya, Shrimp with grits, catfish fritters, and collards to share ... Ahhhhhmazing!!!!!!  Thanks for a wonderful experience!!!!  We WILL be back!!!!  Reader: do yourself a favor and try this place out for southern Louisiana Cajun style cuisine!"

6/5/2018,4 star rating,"This is a new spot that I will visit again for sure.  The service was prompt and welcoming. Aside from the bland mac and cheese, the food was delicious with bold flavors plated beautifully. The Georgian hummus was 5 star worthy. If not for the seats feeling a bit flimsy/cheap, and the wall by our table being dirty, I would rate 5 stars."
9/9/2017,3 star rating,"Came here with my cousin from PA, we were seated by the door which was very odd. We got to this place at 6 and it was dead, however they didn't want to seat us in the other section.However, the food was just ok. Had better soul food. Our waitress Renae was very nice and sweet."
5/14/2017,1 star rating,"I had the worst dining experience of my life at Savannahblue.  After reading rave reviews for months, we got reservations as a celebration for my friend moving out of the state.  We arrived 15 min early and the front of the house told us to sit near the bar and they would get us.  30 min passed, I went back up and the hostess informed us their computer system was down so they didnt know we were there or what was going on with tables so to sit back down.  We waited another 15 minutes (now 30 min after our scheduled reservation) and finally someone came to help us find a table.Unfortunately, the experience only became worse as the night went on.  Our waiter dropped off menus, walked away, and 30 min passed with no help or contact.  He finally came and took out orders.  25 minutes pass, then the waiter came back out to inform us that the fried chicken and oxtail (ordered 25 min ago) was out so we had to make a different selection.  Another 45 minutes pass, no contact from the staff.  As it was 1.5 hrs since we sat down with no food, we stated we would leave and asked for our bill.  The manager handled the situation quite well and comped our meal and 10 minutes later we had food.The food was nothing special.  The boil was mussels in broth, no other ingredients.  The salmon was standard.  I would never recommend going to the restaurant, a huge disappointment.  I was mortified to bring people from out of town to the restaurant after boasting about the Detroit food scene for months as this was an utter embarrassment."
2/10/2018,5 star rating,"The fried chicken. Whoa. It comes with a side of greens & candied yams. Each item was excellent. My friend ordered the shrimp jambalaya he said it was good but not phenomenal (he ate the entire thing, by the way!) He said he was hoping for a more traditional jambalaya. I thought it was really good. They give you cornbread with honey butter melted on top as you wait for your food, we really enjoyed that.  The hostess didn't crack a smile once. She asked if we had reservations, to which we replied that we'd called several times with no answer. She said, ""yeah, the phone's been ringing a lot"". UMM.. is that YOUR job to make reservations? If so, answer the calls as they ring instead of commenting on their abundance & belittling the customers standing a foot in front of you for not having reservations.. not sure how this system works there. I will very likely return when I'm in town next."
3/10/2020,4 star rating,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and service at SavannahBlue. The food was also very good, I had the jambalaya which had a bit more liquid than I prefer. My wife had the whole Red Snapper which was amazing! Highly recommend"
6/10/2017,4 star rating,"Had dinner here on a Friday night, and surprisingly they were not crowded.  I think it may have to do with the NBA finals that night.   Upon entering, the staff was very hospitable.  Didn't need much time to review the menu, because there are not many entree options.  I chose the fried chicken, max n cheese, and collard greens which was tasty and came out pretty quick.   Really impressed with the service we received and would return based on the good service."
4/9/2017,4 star rating,"We just celebrated our wedding anniversary at Savannah Blue this weekend. It was great that they took reservations. The only big downside was the kitchen was really slow, the staff apologized for the wait, but it did detract from the overall meal. Food wise everything was fantastic, southern/soul food - delicious! To start we ordered the whitefish fritters, I was expecting a batter/fried dish, but it was just small bites of fried whitefish with a remoulade sauce. Not disappointing, just not what I expected. For meals I had crab cakes, mac & cheese and collards. All were fantastic. The crab cakes were tender and not too much filler. The collards were ok, and mac and cheese was exceptional! My husband had the shrimp and grits, there was plenty of shrimp and it had a nice balance. We ordered a bottle of wine, so I can't speak for the drinks. Everything we saw come through looked good, I don't think the menu had anything that didn't sounds good."
7/1/2018,5 star rating,Very good food! Fast service!! The shrimp and grits are amazing! Cornbread was great!
3/15/2020,1 star rating,I have NEVER felt so discriminated against going into a restaurant. I was so excited to eat there. So we didn't have a problem getting seated. The girl at the front was very friendly but the problem started when we sat down. After being seated we sat there for literally 5-6 minutes or a little longer. No one came to acknowledge us at all and it wasn't that busy. So I would understand if they were busy and it took a bit to get to us but there were about maybe five tables . So I'm watching the servers seat another couple & after less than a minute they came poured them water & greeted them. All while we literally were still sitting there and waiters were just walking by us more than once. So we finally got up and left. As we are walking out the tables that were in the front room where the bar was filled with people but before when we were waiting to get seated it was empty. I brought that up because as we walked out I looked at the tables that were filled upon probably at the time when we were seated and they already had some appetizers & yet we were never acknowledged! I don't get how and why me and my guy were treated that way? Anyways I will definitely be telling people not to come there. It was a real disappointment.
8/21/2019,5 star rating,"This restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but completely exceeded my expectations. The staff was super friendly and attentive, and handled my food allergies very well. Our waitress went above and beyond for me, and the food was DELICIOUS! If you're in the area and aren't sure where to go, this is the place!"
2/9/2019,1 star rating,"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants. I am not quick to judge a restaurant by a ""few"" mishaps. With that being said  this evening was probably the 100th time I've dined here. The management has constant turnover and the current management is atrociously unprofessional. The bartenders and wait staff are more interested in socializing than providing quality service. Service is slow without a smile. The food is either good to excellent or bad to Burt and unacceptable. I won't be returning."
3/19/2017,5 star rating,"YUM! YUM! YUM! We started with the cat fish fritters and they were freaking delicious, The breading was spot on and the slaw and sauce was scrumptious. I decided to be sensible and not order a salad so that I could have dessert. Priorities are important! So next up were the braised oxtails. They were served with cheese risotto and I chose to also have the collard greens, because how can you not eat collard greens? The oxtails were super tender and flavorful. I could have eaten 100 of them. The risotto left nothing to be desired (except that I wish there was more of it) and the greens melted in my mouth. I also tried a bite of the fried chicken off of my friend's plate and it was breaded to perfection, well seasoned and super juicy. For dessert I had the banana fosters bread pudding. FTW! I wanted to take a bucket of it home, court it and marry it.The ambiance was great, the cocktails were inventive, and the service was friendly. All in all a great place to go."

8/13/2018,5 star rating,Based on a recommendation from my brother my family visited SavannahBlue yesterday and the food and service was amazing. I had the shrimp and grits....the portion size was perfect....the seasoning was well balanced and full of flavor. I ordered the Mac and Cheese as a side....it was full of cheese but not over whelming. The wait staff did not miss a beat and the manager came over to check in with us. Overall it was a great dining experience.
8/13/2018,3 star rating,"My husband and I visited this restaurant yesterday 08/12 for our anniversary. The food overall was pretty good . The prices were higher than what I expected but since it was our anniversary why not go all out..... the honey cornbread you get while your waiting is good ours was just warm but had it been fresh out the oven it would have been excellent. We had the crab cake ( be advised you get one jumbo crab cake for $14 ) and you could tell it was real crab so big thumbs up for them. I had catfish with collard greens and Mac and cheese. The catfish was really good , so was the greens the only thing is the Mac and cheese lacked salt but I get that because everyone taste buds are different. My hubby had the shrimp and grits it was overall good it the grits were cheesy but he missed the creole seasoning in it. I also had a French 75 (drink) and it was ok refreshing but I couldn't taste the liquor . Overall I would go back and visit for brunch with girlfriends."
8/12/2018,1 star rating,"This is based on service alone. I did not get an opportunity to try the food as my review will make clear shortly.We arrived at the restaurant at 14:00 and were told dining would not start until 14:30. We were a party of 5, with 2 kids. We were offered the lounge area that catered to walk-ins. At 14:45 we had not heard anything from the hostess. At which point I went to inquire on our table. The hostess said she'd get back to us shortly.At 14:50 she walked up with what appeared to be a manager who informed us that we could not be seated at the bar area because we had 2 kids with us, and that he could not seat us in the dining area as he had a reservation for 15:45 and had to honor it.Why make us wait for 45 minutes only to turn us away. The kids were with us the whole time. If this was an issue why didn't the hostess make it known when we walked in?"
8/11/2018,2 star rating,"Went to Savannah Blue for my husband's birthday. I read the reviews prior to making reservations and thought I was in for a treat! Unfortunately, I we did not have a great experience as hoped. I ordered the shrimp and grits. My meal was tasty. My husband, the birthday boy ordered Catfish which came with two sides for $23. He ordered two sides of mac and cheese. The mac and cheese came out burnt! It was scorched on the top and dry in the middle. He asked the waitress if it was supposed to look that way and if it was, he would request a different side. The waitress reported that it was not supposed to be burned. My husband was then told by the manager who further handled the situation that new mac would be prepared. The manager took the mac to the back and left the fish with my husband at the table. It took roughly 15 minutes or more to receive his mac and cheese at which point his fish was cold and I was finished with my meal. My husband took his meal to go. No comps were given and no apologies for the wait on the meal were given either. After we complained to the manager again about the length of time it took. We got an apology and that was all. Needless to say, we wont be back. Sad because the decor and ambiance is great. Wish we could have had a better experience especially for my husbands b day dinner."

8/4/2018,5 star rating,Food was great.. Love the mac n cheese and fried chicken breast.staff was awesome. Very nice ambiance. It was cool to be able to see the people mover ride past.
8/3/2018,5 star rating,Extremely delicious fried chicken with maple syrup and pecans for dipping. Yum. Candied yams were good but the collard greens were out of this world . My husband had one of the best crab cakes we ever tasted.
8/3/2018,5 star rating,"First of all... I selected this because it is labelled as ""vegetarian friendly"" which I'd say is not true.  There are zero vegetarian entrees on the menu.  Like any restaurant, you can order vegetarian side dishes or special order entrees with meat removed but I'd say it's misleading to call it VF.  Second, the appearance from the outside is not very impressive but borderline sketchy.  I was completely comfortable there but I could see how someone else may not have been.  We had to park in a tight lot for $7 and walk halfway around the building to enter.  I would tell people not to be dissuaded by this.  It's also on the second floor and although I did not see an elevator, I assume there should be one.  If you can't climb the stairs you should find out ahead of time what to do.Aside from those two issues, the place was outstanding.  It was clean, well-decorated, nice ambience, pleasant crowd, friendly hosts and servers, cotton tablecloths and napkins, decent pours on the cocktails. Our server was Byron; he was super professional, friendly and knowledgable about the menu...and fun.  The prices are very reasonable as the food and experience were much like a fine dining restaurant. It is a bit loud. The cuisine is really soul food with a northern twist which I didn't realize before arriving.  Although they have a few mainstream dishes most of the menu is not the usual meat and potatoes.  Nice variety and everything we had was absolutely delicious."
8/3/2018,1 star rating,"This place is in a decent location and the food was amazing. Our bartender made us great drinks. I was seated at the bar and enjoyed the atmosphere however, I will NEVER go back again. Why? the service was so disrespectful to the point that it was intolerable. Prior to settling to sit at the bar, the hostess had a 15 minute conversation with her coworker about where to seat us, a party of 6.. the lack of professionalism was disregarding as we continued. While placing our orders, people that walked in after us had gotten their drinks and food then finished their meal before we were even served our drinks. They also forgot half our order and it took 20 minutes to even put a drink order in.. I have never experienced service like this. THEN the manager had the audacity to come out and apologize but still charge us for half the shit they forgot. Management needs to be restructured and they need to figure out how to better manage their time while trying to serve customers."

3/6/2020,4 star rating,"Good food and chill ambiance. I've been here several times and I feel like the food is consistent. The last time I tried the non traditional jambalaya, Mac and cheese and catfish."
5/1/2019,1 star rating,"As much as I would love to eat here, I couldn't get anyone to return my phone calls to make a reservation for 9 people. The website says to call if you have over 6. I finally got someone to answer the phone, and I was told they don't take reservations for over 6.  That their policy is only 6.  Then their website needs to state that and not say call if you have a larger party. Needless to say, I won't be recommending them to anyone."
10/23/2016,5 star rating,"Love the atmosphere, decor, service! The waiter was excellent, he knew a lot about the food and was excited about the restaurant. Food was great!

9/20/2016,4 star rating,"I came here for my birthday, for the first time and greatly enjoyed it. The food was fresh and flavorful. The collard greens were just as good as grandma's. My fried chicken was seasoned to perfection and moist. The waiter was very nice and attentive. Everyone enjoyed their dinners and had a great time.Downfall: not handicap accessible! It's on the second floor, but no elevator. My grandmother came and uses a walker. Considering she can still walk upstairs, it wasn't a totally deal breaker, but I feel sorry for the people who can't walk upstairs at all.  For that reason alone, I am taking away a star."

My husband ordered the fried chicken, greens and yams. I am still thinking about the maple pecan yams. My husband cannot stop talking about how good the food was, we will definitely be back soon!"
7/22/2016,3 star rating,"Heard about this place and was looking forward to the food. FIVE STARS for food. Our table had oxtails, fried chicken, fried fish, bread pudding and chocolate cake. Nothing disappointed! The best oxtails I've ever had! Rich in flavor. Enjoyed the different textures. Service was very good (except the hostess). Attentive, friendly and helpful. Stars were lost in ambiance, how loud the place was and the fact that it is a non handicap accessible business in 2016. There are stairs and no elevators. Those in wheelchairs can forget it and those needing canes should think twice. Are they trying to eliminate this demographic? Isn't this illegal?Regarding the volume: given the small space, the loud music and loud party conversations are amplified! Everyone at my table walked away with scratchy throats from having to yell most of the time. Love the growth of restaurant options in Downtown Detroit."
4/15/2019,5 star rating,Great food. Great service. Great energy! I came here for my birthday tonight and my entire party had an amazing time. All of the food was good! The entire staff was friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was just excellent. I wish I could give them more than 5 stars.
11/14/2016,4 star rating,"The hostesswaa a little distracted when we got there and we had to wait a bit, but other than that we had a great experience. The bartenders were all great and th e drinks were stiff. Just right. Let me start by saying that the cornbread is amazing.it was moist and buttery. Everything I could want. Thr crab cake had real crab and was absolutely delicious and the mac and cheese was gooey and baked. I ordered the fried chicken witb the maple sauce and it was delicious. The portions are hearty so I definitely didn't have all of it. My bf ordered the motor city boil and he loved it. Next time, I want to try the oxtail, it looked amazing. I would definitely recommend this place for some good food."
12/31/2018,2 star rating,Food was just okay... I expected the food to be better. The atmosphere however is very nice! You have to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the restaurant... no points taken for that- just a warning. The most disappointing aspect of my visit was the macaroni and cheese! You can not be a southern food restaurant with subpar M/C‍
9/2/2018,4 star rating,"This food was amazing. . I had the chicken with greens & sweet potatoes plus a side of Mac & cheese. All of it was great. Hubby had the chicken sandwich & the humus. He loved them both. We ended up getting our food to go as the wait was over an hour. As another Yelper mentioned - the service was not good at all. I was unclear on a long wait time when the place was not crowded at all. The female that seated us at the bar closed a laptop & pulled up another stool & the male immediately showed up saying ""that's my stuff"". Both of them worked there. ‍ They couldn't tell us if we sat at the bar if would be still be able to get a table. That was strange. I also feel a friendly smile goes a long way, not the Half angry look that was displayed on her face the entire time we were there. Hopefully things get better because the food was excellent!"
7/21/2016,5 star rating,"This place is great, breaks into my top 3 in Detroit, and I've been to quite a few places.There really isn't much to say, everything was excellent.  Atmosphere is welcoming, staff is super helpful and service is outstanding.  The manager (owner?) even offered to run to the closest liquor store when they didn't have an ingredient stocked in a drink I ordered.  We had a party of 11 and our server handled it very professionally.  The staff as a whole were on their A game.The food was equally as good as the service, if not better.  I strongly suggest getting the wings...best I've had in Michigan, outside of my own :).  I had shrimp and grits and it was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  We'll be back for sure, can't wait to try the whole menu."
5/29/2017,5 star rating,"My absolute Favorite spot in the ""D""!  Soul food fusion menu....  I fell in love with the ox tails...their specialty...served with risotto and green beans!  Bartender has skills as well!  The sidecar is impeccable!!  Restaurant is divided into 3 areas...a bar, lounge and dining room.  Each is rather intimate.....and decorated sexy sleek.  It tends to fit for each purpose.  I've been about 5 times....once I was in a group of 25 or so, that perfectly fit in the bar area for a Anniversary party.  After dining in the dining room once, we were relocated to the lounge that might seat 10 or so for nite caps....it's truly a special place. Great concept and location...I do wish they opened for lunch and on Sundays....but either way...I love it!  Would def recommend trying them out!"
9/18/2016,4 star rating,"Cool spot.  Probably would have passed right by if it weren't for my navigation and ""google earth"" (to see the building sans renovation).  Pulled in to the parking sign behind the building.  A little strange since you walk back through the alley to get to the front... not major except the dumpster and standing water we had to pass were flat out rancid.  Not sure what can be done but perhaps some creative thinking can come up with a good concept so that guests don't lose their appetite (or their dinner) on the way to and from cars (maybe valet instead).So I took my 16 year old god daughter here for a little GNO this summer.  Classy place.  Went up the stairs to the hostess stand where two young ladies were having a conversation that we seemed to be interrupting much to their dismay, but quickly one broke from whatever was so comical and led us through what appeared to be a lounge area and then back to the dining area.  Decorated modern, we were seated at a smaller table with a neat street view.  The location is a little unusual but I like people watching.Our server (I believe she said her name was Jane.) was pleasant and quick.Jumbo crab cakes were our appetizer and it was delicious.  I recommend.For the soup we both chose the sweet potato bisque which was not available but our server recommended another soup instead... it was a seafood chowder type and very good.  It was also $3 a piece more than the original soup - not that it wasn't worth it but I think that should have been mentioned.My god daughter had the house burger which she said was a phenomenally juicy burger.  It looked huge.  I had the braised oxtail.  I am sort of a ""newbie"" to oxtail and my second experience was no let down.  I'm not sure I would classify this as ""Southern"" food but it's most definitely tasty and well prepared.  The entire dish was plated well and went together well.  I had two martinis during our visit which I originally thought were mixed up... but now I think they may have been prepared differently than they were mentioned on the menu.  In any light, I was pleased and that isn't a complaint at all... there were actually quite a few innovative drinks on the list.For dessert, we wanted chocolate cake but that was not available as well... kind of a bummer.  But we were excited when Jane returned with sweet potato cheese cake for us - on the house.  That was actually our other choice we thought about picking and you know what?  It should have been my first.  It's a must try!  The prices might be a little higher than I'd agree with on a few things here, but I can't say I was disappointed by far.  A few items weren't available, but that's growing pains I'm sure and it seemed there was no issue with trying to make it right.  Stop in.  Check it out.  It's a different take on ""soul food"" and it's right on point."
1/29/2018,4 star rating,"Went here for a birthday dinner and was impressed. The location isn't great and a little hidden, but it was worth it. The food was great. The black-eye pea hummus was a great app. The fried chicken was top notch. I don't usually care for collard greens, but I ate them all. Also has a few bites of the burger which was cooked perfectly. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal. Nice cocktails and liked the vibe too."
7/5/2017,5 star rating,"This is such a great place. The food is wonderful!  I suggest the Georgian Hummus and shrimp and grits...they are amazing!  The ambiance is pretty great too. The lighting, the decor, and the staff will wow you too. Such a wonderful experience!"
11/6/2018,5 star rating,It's been a while since my wife and I went here but wanted to leave a review. Great food and service. Probably the best Oxtail I've ever had. Fried Chicken was also $$$.
1/21/2019,5 star rating,Stumbled upon this gem randomly and am not disappointed! We had the chicken chowder soup and crab cakes for an app ( DELICIOUS!) I had the catfish with macaroni and greens (PERFECTION) and my boyfriend had chicken yams and greens. Everything was seasoned to perfection. The only downfall to this place were the black eye peas that we sent back. We will definitely be coming back! Service was also great :)
6/26/2018,2 star rating,"I have tried this restaurant 3 times...twice for dinner and once for lunch. Every experience was horrible in some shape or fashion. Yesterday was baffling because it was only about 10 people in the entire restaurant and the service was slow and the food was cold. Two people  in our party of four had to send their food back.  The drinks were watered down and the waitress seemed like it bothered her to travel back to the table to check on us. My husband asked for some hot sauce and it took her almost 10 mins to bring it to him...again...it was only about 10 patrons there...how could she forget.  Well, that's it for me, don't think I want to come here again. Savannah definitely made me blue."
5/6/2018,4 star rating,Came here recently for a dinner and nice night out. The chicken and the sweet tea were probably the two best menu items. The oxtail was okay I was kind of craving it but nothing to write home about unfortunately look forward to coming back soon. Nice decor.
10/27/2018,5 star rating,We went here after checking for near by places to our hotel. Had an awesome experience ever member of the staff we interacted with incredibly friendly and attentive. The craft cocktails were great. My wife typically gets a French 75 when we are out and this was one of the best she has had with there house crafted infused syrup. The food was great. I'll drive the four hours just to get some more of the collard greens.
3/13/2018,4 star rating,"I came here with some friends from work for an early birthday dinner.  I made reservation on their website, which I definitely suggest.  The location was easy to find and I was able to park in the back for 7 dollars.  You can luck up and find street parking, but I like to play it safe and pay for parking.  There was a gentleman at the door; that helped finding the door to enter.  Once inside, there are some steps to climb, but well worth it when you enter a very nice restaurant.  One of the things about this place is the ambiance.  It's dimly lit for any occasion.  I would suggest sitting in the front area near the bar because the back area is loud and crowded.  We sat at the bar because we were there before 7pm (happy hour).  They didn't have a happy hour menu (disappointing), and they did not have Moscoto or a non-dry Riesling... you definitely need to have a great Riesling to serve the wine drinkers.  We settled on a margarita.  It was small for 7 dollars and the taste was bad.Food:  Our table had the catfish, crab cake, mac and cheese, sweet potatoes and wings.  The catfish and crab cake was a HIT! I didn't like the square mac and cheese, the sweet potatoes were just okay and the wings were not that great.I will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items.  This is definitely a place for date night, family outing or work outing.  If you want to take the kids, I would suggest going before 6 maybe early as possible."
10/21/2017,5 star rating,"I have to admit, I was skeptical. Small menu. Lots could go wrong, right? Totally wrong. Hip interior space, enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff, owners on site most of the night, large and creative bar with fun drink names from video games...you had me at your street fighter references honestly Savannahblue but still I wanna tell you how amazing your Mac and cheese, cornbread, sweet potato mash, risotto and fried chicken with honey pecan maple voodoo magic dipping sauce is....amazing, life changing and lovely. Put some hush puppies on this menu and I'll be back more often. Xoxo"

4/5/2016,5 star rating,The food here is awesome! I'm a visitor from Chicago where there is no shortage of food and this place definitely delivered. I ordered the shrimp and grits with a crab cake as the appetizer and it was phenomenal. The crab cake was mostly crab and not filler and tasty. I also ordered the peach martini which there was no skimping on the liquor. The service was great as well. I highly recommend it!
8/21/2016,5 star rating,"We received awesome service from your young energetic and kind server. We tried the black eyed pea hummus and the watermelon gazpacho, both of which were delicious. Both my friend and I tried two salads which were large enough to fill us up. The sweet yum salad and the kale salad with eggs and bacon were priced so reasonably and very refreshing. Had a great time.... The restaurant is big , quite busy without being over crowded. Had a great time"
10/6/2018,5 star rating,"I took my wife for our 15th wedding anniversary.  The service was prompt and friendly.  Since it was our first time at this establishment our waiter, Byron, shared a bit of SavannahBlue's background, as well as his recommendations on cocktails and food.  The crab cake appetizer and Sinnaman cocktail were definite hits for us.  My wife ordered the Shrimp and Grits, while I had the SB Catfish with collards and yams.  The catfish was lightly breaded, yet so flavorful so no hot sauce or tartar we're needed.  My wife's entree was full flavored and delightful.  Both meals were large enough portions that you could likely share between two and still leave full.   Overall, SavannahBlue is a fantastic restaurant and I highly recommend for a night out with your significant other for some legit satisfying sampling of soul food."

1/27/2018,5 star rating,Nice place to take a date for a nice dinner.  Not the greatest beer choices but good wine list.  Food is great.  It's southern comfort food.  The fried chicken was excellent especially with the maple and pecan.  The collard greens were excellent.  The catfish fritters were good as well.  I am not a catfish lover.  Get the bananas foster bread pudding.
9/28/2019,5 star rating,"Very happy with this place. We had the oxtails, crab cakes, and catfish nugget appetizers. Everything was delicious.

8/13/2018,3 star rating,"My husband and I visited this restaurant yesterday 08/12 for our anniversary. The food overall was pretty good . The prices were higher than what I expected but since it was our anniversary why not go all out..... the honey cornbread you get while your waiting is good ours was just warm but had it been fresh out the oven it would have been excellent. We had the crab cake ( be advised you get one jumbo crab cake for $14 ) and you could tell it was real crab so big thumbs up for them. I had catfish with collard greens and Mac and cheese. The catfish was really good , so was the greens the only thing is the Mac and cheese lacked salt but I get that because everyone taste buds are different. My hubby had the shrimp and grits it was overall good it the grits were cheesy but he missed the creole seasoning in it. I also had a French 75 (drink) and it was ok refreshing but I couldn't taste the liquor . Overall I would go back and visit for brunch with girlfriends."

9/22/2018,5 star rating,"Great atmosphere, awesome service and fantastic food. First time the 4 of us visited the place and we will be back for sure.

Our favorite dishes were the crabcake and the fried chicken. The dessert was a spectacular too."
6/10/2016,5 star rating,"Tried SavannahBlue with a couple of friends recently. So I love Soul Food...and knew I had to try out this upper scale, enhanced version of the soul. Generally speaking, I love a good, HEARTY meal and initially, I was worried that Savannah would produce more cute, portionally challenged meals and I would leave the restaurant still hungry. Thankfully, that was not the case! My friends and I started with the black-eyed hummus/delightful pita bread. It was awesome! Definitely recommend. We all sampled three different entrees: Oxtails/Risotto, Fried Chicken/Greens/Sweet Potatoes, and Crab Cakes/Shoestring fries. I enjoyed everything. The best thing for me was the Risotto (it was sooo creamy, cheesy, and just...delectable!) and the crab cakes. The crab cakes are not filled with...ehh..""fillers."" It was the real deal, 100% crab..and they are HUGE - definitely filling. Highly recommend. We also tried a side of macaroni and cheese, which is not on the menu. It was good as well. And I will say that I don't even like oxtails, but they were amazing here and made me a convert. And now...the Customer Service. It was amazing. I have no complaints. The chef even came to our table to introduce himself and gave us the opportunity to ask any questions. The ambience of the restaurant is...sexy. Dim lighting, exposed brick wall, soft music in the background. It was just classy. I was so impressed. I cannot wait to come back! FYI, parking is either in the lot behind the restaurant (valet  or self parking = $10) or you can find metered street parking."

5/13/2018,5 star rating,"Stumbled on Savannah Blue while downtown for a Tigers game. It was a fantastic way to end Mothers Day. If you are looking for an upscale hip and stylish soul food experience, this is the place. We had the catfish with smashed potatoes and collard greens and the salmon with carrots and yams. It was all delicious...and the cornbread...wow!"
6/17/2018,4 star rating,"I got the fried chicken that came with collard greens and substituted the candied yams for Mac and cheese. Chicken and greens were delicious! The Mac and cheese was a bit dry and would probably try something else next time.

11/4/2018,5 star rating,"This was our first time visiting Savannah Blue and we sill definitely be back!  The shrimp and grits were exceptional, as were the crab cakes.  Mom had the jambalaya and the shrimp was a little too spicy for her, but great flavor if youre okay with a little heat.  Ticket time was literally less than 10 minutes,  but we were there for a 515 reservation.  This is some of the best that Detroit has to offer!"

5/3/2019,5 star rating,"During a recent business trip, I visited SavannahBlue with a group of colleagues.  From the cornbread to the appetizers.... everything was delicious. The catfish, black eye pea hummus, fried chicken, red snapper and ribs with collards and sweet potatoes....were all seasoned well and cooked to perfection. As a Marylander I rarely try crab cakes out of my home state but I tried the crab cake and am glad I did. It was all lump crabmeat and well seasoned. We thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and food. The portions are generous and the service was exceptional. I look forward to visiting again on my next trip to Detroit."
3/26/2016,4 star rating,"The place is really contemporary looking and has a good atmosphere. Ordered a spiked Arnold Palmer. It wasn't a bad drink. The waiter said the drinks were strong, but mine wasn't. It tasted good, though.For my entree, I ordered the SavannahBlue Fried Chicken. The fried chicken breast had the perfect breading. The maple pecan sauce that came with it was really good as well. My collard greens had a good flavor but were really salty. The sweet potato purée was good.Also, you have to pay to park here. If you follow the signs for Savannah Blue parking, you'll be charged $7. I parked in the lot right next to it and was charged $5. I didn't get a dessert, but they all looked really good.I'm giving the restaurant 4/5 stars because of the collard greens. I would come back again with friends and try other things on the menu."

I have told my family  and friends about this restaurant and brought a party of 6 one day so they can experience this place. The house dry rub wings are awesome, please get those for an appetizer, the Mac n cheese is great too omg, I could go on and on. I wish the whole world knew about this restaurant. The ambiance is nice I wish they could expand, only bad thing is there is no elevator but the food is so good you forget about the stairs to take to get up and down from and to the seating area, But anyway I'm ready for catfish and black eyed peas with greens, see you guys lata! Or do I want the salmon, or the ox tails ??  decisions decisions"
11/15/2016,4 star rating,"This is a really nice place. Hidden away on a second floor with a nondescript entrance (see pics) the layout is spacious, modern, and comfortable. I went the small-plate route with the chop salad, seafood soup, and pork-belly cowboy beans app and couldn't have been happier. Definitely worth a try."
8/19/2018,5 star rating,Absolutely amazing food and service. I ordered the jambalaya and it was delicious. Others at my table ordered the oxtails and the fried chicken which was extremely tasty too. Our server Mike provided 5 star service and I really enjoyed the overall setting of the restaurant. The next time I'm in Detroit I will be returning for more!!
4/20/2016,4 star rating,"The food is delicious. I don't know anything about soul food. But this food tastes great. I got the fried chicken with sweet potato mash and collared greens. That sounded like pretty authentic soul food to me. The chicken and sweet potatoes were stunning. The collared greens were... interesting. I'd never had collared greens before, so for all I know these are the best collared greens in the world. But it was all great. My wife got the seared salmon, which was also fabulous.The portions were really big too. We were about to explode after our appetizer, main courses, and the dessert of peach berry cobbler. That cobbler was incredible though. We weren't even hungry and we ate the whole huge thing.The wine my wife got was really delicious. And the cocktail that I got, The Old Old Fashioned, was pretty good. This place isn't a cocktail bar or anything, so don't expect it to be out of this world.But the atmosphere was really cool. It was very lively. The lounge area was decorated very well, much better than the dining area unfortunately. I would love to come back here and try some other items off of their menu.The only downfall was that we walked right past the door. That's probably our fault more than there's though. But once you're in the door there's a staircase going down and a staircase going up with now signage do tell you where to go. We guessed upstairs, which turned out to be correct. Also, try not to sit facing the windows during the day, the reflection of the sun on the people mover as it passes every 5 minutes or so got pretty annoying."

4/12/2018,5 star rating,"Ok so this place has been a couple things over the past 7 years! Let's go back down memory lane it used to be a nitelife club called Icon then it turned into a Pizzeria. Now it has evolved into this great lounge and dining experience. Dim lighting and 1.5 flights and your in Savannah Blues! Good food for the soul and great music background playing! Has a community table for conversational setting and a grand piano in the corner; a bar with tall stools and 2-4 top tables for a intimate seating. I love this place and they have a decent happy hour from 4-7p. One thing I would admit is the service needs to tighten up, your bar tender can be your waiter as well which is not too cool because they are not only hosting the bar but tending to the normal patron there to eat. That's the only downside from my experience."
8/4/2018,5 star rating,Food was great.. Love the mac n cheese and fried chicken breast.staff was awesome. Very nice ambiance. It was cool to be able to see the people mover ride past.
8/3/2018,5 star rating,Extremely delicious fried chicken with maple syrup and pecans for dipping. Yum. Candied yams were good but the collard greens were out of this world . My husband had one of the best crab cakes we ever tasted.

1/20/2018,4 star rating,"It's a SUPER cold Wednesday night in Detroit and my team member wants to go to dinner. We drove from Auburn Hills and arrive at this almost hidden location...something about that was pretty cool to me.We got our first dose of excellent service before we even made it up the stairs. The hostess was wearing a gorgeous smile, greeted us, and sat us at the table of our liking right away.There wasn't many guests at all. I mean it was a Wednesday night. However, the low lit lights and loungy feel in the bar area complete with an intimate yet social seating area and piano let me know that the weekends here draw in a size able crowd of cool kids.Our server was equally pleasant. She gave us the full rundown since we were first-timers, and was very honest about the items we inquired about on the menu. We each tasted about 2 wines before we made our selection and she was very patient with us. Between tastings she showed up with cornbread that was buttered for dear life. Like, buttery buttery. Like, very buttery. Anywho...I ordered the crab cake entree, because...well,I love crab cakes and I felt it was only right. My friend ordered the fried chicken entree and added mac n cheese as an additional side. As a self-proclaimed crab cake connoisseur, I am comfortable standing behind these crab cakes. Also, ALSO, I tasted fork full of the collards from my friend's plate and they were several different kinds of delicious! I absolutely loved that they flavored it with smoked turkey instead of pork. Ok. So back to my plate, I ordered sauteed spinach and the yams for my sides. I know, I know...yams don't quite compliment crab cakes, but I was super curious. The spinach was a bit bland and the yams were just OK. 2 glasses of  wine later and chatting over our food, our server took my food to the back ad boxed it up for me. Sweet. I asked about the dessert options even though I had zero intention on ordering anything. She named way more items than I expected for a dessert menu in a place like this. The bananas foster bread pudding had me curious, but I refrained. My friend is a true lover of peach cobbler so he couldn't resist. Good thing I didn't order anything, because this dish was share sized. Unfortunately, the cobbler was disappointing. Nothing about it tasted like it was homemade or fresh. Actually. The middle of it was cold. It was getting late and close to closing so we didn't mention it and just left.Def check out Savannah Blue. Date night, a group of engaging friends, or even a solo dolo person who likes to meet new folks would enjoy this spot."
4/20/2018,3 star rating,"I would give it 3.5 but you can't do half stars. And I would give it more IF my friend didn't have such a horrible experience with her reservations for a family event. THE FOOD--the wings were good. They were well seasoned and it seemed like they were a staple because everyone around us had a ""cone"" of wings. We didn't eat anything else because we were bar hailing and had dinner plans elsewhere, but we (my husband and I) both said we would go back and get a meal next time. THE MENU--looked short but sweet. Staple-upscale-comfort food if you will...THE BOOZE--great selection of low and top shelf liquor. Unique ""prohibition""-like drinks and southern twists on classics. THE AMBIANCE--really cool. Has that ""hole in the wall"" feel but classy when you get inside. Great lounge off the bar area. THE SERVICE--we didn't have a problem. They were nice but not over attentive. My friend made reservations for 4 on a Saturday and wanted to add 2 more people so she called on a Tuesday and was given the run around and that a manager had to approve that change and they would call her back that day. My friend never heard back. She called Friday and they continued to give her the run around and couldn't ""find"" the manager. She finally cancelled the reservation and then a manager called and said ""we can't guarantee but most likely we can put your tables next to each other..."" really?!?! She finally complained and said she would be contacting the restaurant owner and he manager finally said ""oh no. Wait. We have a table for 6..."" too late man! Don't give people the run around and don't offer to fix the problem by ""putting their tables next to each other"" guess I will only ever plan on going there when there is only 2-4 of us....which is a shame - they're losing money that way..."
4/3/2018,5 star rating,I had the crab cakes and they were AMAZING!! They come with 2 large portion sides.  The staff was friendly but it got busy while we were there and it took a while to get our checks.....still worth it though.
9/4/2017,4 star rating,"I made reservations at Savannah Blue recently on a Saturday night for a group of four.  We were seated right away. This restaurant is trendy and very nice.  The restaurant is on the second floor so you have to walk up a flight of stairs.  When you first walk in there is the bar area. In that area you have couches, piano and I think there were a few more high tables around. They have nice music playing in that area. The hostess will walk you pass the bar area to the dinning area.  No booths only tables.  The dining area is not that big but not too crowded.  There was only one negative about my experience. The drink menu.  They only kind of serve what's on the menu.  It appeared to be a full bar.  So I asked the waiter can they make a drink called RUM punch.  I was told that I have to tell him what's exactly in the drink and they might can make it for me.  I wasn't sure what was in it so he asked the bar tender if he could make it and the waiter came back and said that the bar tender was able to make it.  The drink was ok couldn't really taste any liquor in it.  So it appears to me they are selective on what they can make if its not on the menu.  Next time I will probably just have a glass of wine.For appetizer I got the crab cake and tried my friends catfish fritters.  The crab cake and catfish fritters were cooked just right.  You only get one crab cake for appetizer so you might not want to share.  The catfish fritters you could probably share with 2 to 3 people.   For dinner I ate fried catfish with black eyed peas and mac and cheese.  The catfish was seasoned and cooked just right.  The  black eyed peas and mac and cheese was pretty good as well.   My friend had shrimp and grits which I tried and I think that will be my next meal when I go back.  If you like soul food you should definitely try this place."
6/9/2018,3 star rating,"I have been here two other times and loved the food. Well today service sucked!!! I was seated at the bar I was spoken to and given a napkin. 15 minutes later nothing. No menu, water nothing. Now, I can understand if they were busy but there was two women and another guy at the bar. With two bartenders this is unacceptable!"

1/31/2017,2 star rating,"I want to preface this review by saying that I truly believe that 90% of our dissatisfaction with this place on this night was because of the kitchen. I was super-excited about checking this place out. This was a surprise birthday dinner with my best friend, my Mom, my sister and sister-in-law... a lovely girl's night out celebration of my 50th bday.  We'd made a 6:30 reservation, arrived at about 6:10, but we didn't actually sit at our table until a full hour later.  We basically waited way too long for everything.  While we waited for our table, we sat at the bar and waited to order drinks. We looked over the drink menu for a good little while before the bartender came over, and then she told us that she couldn't make the one drink that half our party had taken time to decide upon because they didn't have the ingredients.  This was basically how our whole night at Savannah Blue went.  My drink was amazing, but we all finished our drinks within 20 minutes, and never saw the bartender again.  We sat at the bar for over half an hour with empty glasses while the hostess kept coming over to tell us the status of our table.  First, they were just being served (this was already past our reserved time), then they were finishing up, then they'd ordered desserts, then we were just waiting for them to leave.... really?  We watched a few parties come in and get seated while we were waiting, which just discouraged us more.  I get the science of turning tables, but we waited way, way too long.  And it was just beginning.Once we were seated, we decided to go ahead and order our food right away.  We'd had a menu at the bar, and we all pretty much knew what we wanted.  Our server (who was fantastic, by the way.  I wish I could remember his name) took our drink order and began telling us the highlights of the menu.  He made the oxtail sound so good I almost changed my mind and ordered it... then he told us that they didn't have it.  They were out.  They were also out of three other things on the menu, two of which we'd planned on ordering.  Great.  We ended up ordering the salmon and the fried chicken.  They comped us some crabcake appetizers, which I thought were wonderful, but then we waited another hour for our food.  Seriously... we ordered as soon as our waiter introduced himself, and we weren't served until an hour later.  The salmon was served in bowls, which was a little weird, but the food was overall good... 3 1/2 stars.  Good, but not really memorable.  We asked about dessert, and our waiter named off two choices... not the 5 that were on the menu.  They had run out of the rest of the options.  We ordered the bread pudding, which none of us were impressed with.  We did a little too much compromising, a lot of sitting and waiting, and our waiter, poor guy, did way too much apologizing.  We watched the table next to us get served the salmon... on a plate.  When we asked our server about this, he said, ""the kitchen ran out of bowls.""  No kidding.  It was almost 10 o'clock when we finally walked down the stairs and back to our car... which in my opinion is way too long to be at a restaurant and not feel satisfied.So, I hope that if you go to Savannah Blue, you go when the kitchen is having a good night, when the bartenders are a little more attentive, and when they have enough food.  No one in my party feels inclined to ever go here again."
5/31/2018,5 star rating,"Delicious food and very modern restaurant located on the second floor of the building they occupy.  They do not have an elevator and there are two flights of stairs..so beware if that may be an issue for you..At the top of the landing, you are warmly greeted and taken to your table.  Nice lounge side and a spacious dining area as well.  There's a Piano although I've never seen it played but there's always Smooth background music.. not to loud where you can't have a conversation but just right.  The food is top notch.  I always have Collards, MAC n Cheese and either fish or Chicken. Never disappointed.  The drinks are generous and strong..like I like them. Tuesday's..are 1/2 off on bottles of wine!  So... I guess you know I'm there on Tuesdays also.  Nice date night spot or for closing a deal!  Check them out.."

5/28/2020,1 star rating,"Ron S. My family was looking for somewhere to go to get good food and I recommended SavannahBlue yesterday to him and his girl on the strength of good quality food and service. When they came yesterday I couldn't believe how your staff treated them as if they was shit. My brother is an Executive Chef for one of the top Steakhouses in Michigan and your staff treated him and his girl like whatever. I was told catfish was not cooked all the way and they brought it out full of oil. Even the new waitress that switch said I don't know what's going on. This never happens. Well today my brother is going to really give you a write up you wasn't expecting. You have to treat people right if you want them to continue to patronize your business. My brother is very well connected in the community and normally he would let things ride but he can't this time. Ms. Yopp was a good friend to me and if she was here with us today, the food would have been better. So in the meantime wait for your review. From him and his girl. Your staff should have corrected the problem instead of having bad attitudes. I told my brother I would have put the plate on the floor representing bad service and walked out. You would have gotten the picture then."

2/18/2017,2 star rating,"The reason why I'm giving this a 2 star is because I feel like big improvements have to be made.  I visited this place on a Wednesday night and although we were sat right away, there was no excuse for the delay in taking our order and getting our drinks.   Our waiter was training another waiter which contributed to the delays.  It took 40 minutes to get our drinks and it only came at that time because we asked the hostess what was going on.  When the drinks came, I asked the waiter (3rd waiter) if the drinks were on the house and he asked why and I told him so he said yes that they would take care of it.    Fast forward, we received our meals shortly after the drinks and our waiter didn't come back again until we were ready for our bills.   The bill came back with our drinks on it so it had to be redone.  I had the shrimp and girls and it was good but not something I would crave to have again.  I was pretty disappointed with the experience and won't be back."

8/24/2018,4 star rating,"We were warmly greeted at the door then climbed the stairs to see this beautiful and popular restaurant. We ordered dry-rubbed wings as an appetizer and they were amazing. Spicy and meaty with an incredible apple bbq sauce on the side.As a kid, whenever my parents took us out to eat, if catfish was on the menu, I would order it. It's been a long time since I've had good catfish, so when I saw it on the menu, my mind was made up. I ordered catfish with greens and smashed potatoes. The potatoes were barely warm, but delicious and the greens were good. The catfish was outstanding ...the best I've had since eating at Buddy Guy's place in Chicago...maybe better.My wife ordered a house salad with mac & cheese. The salad never arrived, but we shared all the other food. After mentioning the missing salad, which we no longer wanted, it was still on the final bill. Our server seemed indifferent, which was off-puting. Bottom line is that the food wins the night and the atmosphere is exceptionally nice. Despite our experience with one server, we would come back here in a heartbeat."
10/26/2017,5 star rating,"This was such a lovely restaurant. Our waitress and the hostess were both gracious and helpful. We had the Oxtail with Collards and Risotto, and it was wonderful.

5/6/2018,5 star rating,"Finally made it here. And why did we wait so long?! Hubby and I shared. The catfish, collards and Yukon smashed were delicious; especially together. Chicken breast, mac n cheese and roasted carrots were tasty too. Nice portions. Great atmosphere. Our host Byron was friendly and accommodating. Can't wait to get back for happy hour."
5/5/2018,5 star rating,Love this place. Hung at the bar. Crab cakes are some of the best in town. Real Crab little to no filler. The $20 Dell drink was worth it. Great bartenders.  Service was positive.

3/11/2019,5 star rating,"This gem in the heart of downtown Detroit is a ""must eat""  find if ever visiting the Motor City.  Being a born and raised Mississippian, I can firmly say the menu is southern, and the catfish dish does my home state proud.  The service team checks periodically to make sure your visit is up to excellent standards.   Thank you Savannah Blue and Roger & Tonya  for making my Detroit a full and satisfied tummy one."
4/24/2018,5 star rating,Best experience in Detroit! Everything was great...not one complaint. We arrived an hour early for our reservations due to our prior engagement ending earlier than expected and we were still sat in the dining room although they were booked for the evening. The fact that they accommodated us says a lot. The hostess was very nice despite the fact of our scheduling mishap. A young lady by the name of Tiana was our waitress. She was very attentive and displayed a positive attitude during our entire visit. I loved the decor.  I would love to experience the restaurant at night. Now the food....delicious! My significant other was very impressed! Mission accomplished! Definitely going back to experience the establishment during the evening hours.

2/18/2019,4 star rating,"Food was amazing! We ordered the jumbo lump crab cake and hummus as appetizers and they really set the standard for how we expected our entree to be because they were so incredible! For the entrees we ordered the oxtail with collard greens and I got the shrimp grits. Let me just say that oxtail was so tender and flavorful, we even got a second order to go! The shrimp and grits was okay, & my particular one only came with 3 shrimps in the entire bowl?.. the drinks were good but too overpriced ($15 for one drink??) The service from the front desk people wasn't great, they seemed annoyed to be there and we waited 25 minutes even though we had a reservation for 10pm along with having to wait 10 minutes for a menu once seated. Our waiter however was great! Didn't see any valet so parking was a mess."
9/16/2017,5 star rating,"This place is amazing! I am so hard on soul food coming from a line of ""from scratch"" cooks. This place gives you Big Mamas cooking with a fine dining twist. Everything was very well seasoned & bursting with flavor. Must tries: Black eye pea humus, Shrimp & Grits, & bread pudding. Oh and for you true soul foodies the greens are prepared with smoked turkey!!! The customer service is above par. Bartenders were very knowledgeable about menu items and Lacey's drinks were on point! Manager, Thor stopped by to check on us and ensure we were having nothing but the best experience. I always appreciate that at a restaurant. Food prices are reasonable and properly portioned. They also offer a happy hour from 3p-6p. The atmosphere is very classy, comfortable, & lounge like. Bar area & main dining room are separate, allowing clientele to capture either a lounge or main dining experience as desired. Music ranges from classic R&B to new school R&B, Soul, & Jazz. This place attracts a more mature/professional mixed crowd. Crowd attire is business casual to dressy. The location is very safe and populated downtown Detroit. Not the place for large parties, but great for intimate occasions and events! I would definitely recommend you try this place at least once. Though, I doubt you stay away ;)"
5/16/2017,4 star rating,The food was really really good. But the crab cakes were cold in the middle. I ordered the shrimp and grits and they were so good. So we're  the braised oxtails.But both weren't very warm. Our waiter was slow and I can only assume our plates sat for awhile.The restaurant itself is very cool and when sitting at the bar having a drink the service was great .I'll definitely go back again but I will sit and eat at the bar.

8/1/2017,5 star rating,Loved everything!! My husband and I went here last night with another couple. It was our first time. Reviews were good so why not. It was fantastic. We ALL loved it!! Our waiter (bummed I can't recall his name) was very attentive and excellent in every way. To start he suggested the Georgian Hummus (black eyed peas instead of chick peas) and all thought hmmmm  But we went with his suggestion and it was SO good we ended ordering another  while waiting for our entrees. Delicious!! We all enjoyed our entrees equally as much. I had the shrimp and grits... perfect and hearty with jumbo shrimp. My husband had the boil which he said was very good. Our friends had the fried chicken and salmon and both enjoyed very much!! We commented how the music wasn't so loud you couldn't hear yourself talk. Everything was lovely and we all said we'd most definitely be returning. Two thumbs up!!!

I will definitely be back!"

The salmon and the chicken wings are both amazing. I met the chef one time and he was great."
5/29/2017,5 star rating,"My absolute Favorite spot in the ""D""!  Soul food fusion menu....  I fell in love with the ox tails...their specialty...served with risotto and green beans!  Bartender has skills as well!  The sidecar is impeccable!!  Restaurant is divided into 3 areas...a bar, lounge and dining room.  Each is rather intimate.....and decorated sexy sleek.  It tends to fit for each purpose.  I've been about 5 times....once I was in a group of 25 or so, that perfectly fit in the bar area for a Anniversary party.  After dining in the dining room once, we were relocated to the lounge that might seat 10 or so for nite caps....it's truly a special place. Great concept and location...I do wish they opened for lunch and on Sundays....but either way...I love it!  Would def recommend trying them out!"
5/29/2017,5 star rating,We had a wonderful experience and will be back. Our server was great and willing to make recommendations that we were delighted with. The food was on point. My husband got the chicken wing appetizer which I initially wasn't feeling but they were so good. Crispy and well seasoned! I had the fried chicken entree which was so tasty on its own but also came with a heavenly maple pecan sauce for dipping. They also let me switch out the sides to whatever I wanted. My husband had the shrimp and grits which he loved. Perfect seasoning and nicely cooked large shrimp. He actually couldn't even finish it! Nice change from the tapas model of meals most new restaurants are using. We dine out a lot and we're pleasantly surprised by how good everything was. It seems like a place that would accommodate large groups and we saw a few kids too. Nice to know we can come back with our child too.
5/25/2017,4 star rating,So last night I went to the Top 10 Detroit take over dinner.  It was a great meal.  Crab cakes where one of the best I ever had.  Oxtail was braised and tender with great flavor and the shrimp grits where good but the grits where a little dry.  The food was great but the service was highly disappointing.  2 people at the table got there desert and 20 minutes later I received mine.  Kinda strange when they know how many deserts to prepare because it was a standard seating with pre ticket sales.  Overall the place was nice. Music was a little loud and that made for a noisy evening.
5/19/2017,5 star rating,"Lemme start off with our server was amazing, Chauncey knew everything on the menu and what this place was about.  The Food was bonkers, oxtail was amazing and my lady ordered the Shrimp and Grits without the sausage and yet came out with every flavor profile one would want.  I have to say O am totally making an effort to come back."
5/16/2017,4 star rating,"Excellent food and service. I came on a Tuesday when there was an unexpected rush due to a nearby concert, so service was s little slow but the bartender apologized and was very friendly. Berry Moscow mule was different and tasty. Food was great - try the peach berry cobbler."
5/16/2017,4 star rating,The food was really really good. But the crab cakes were cold in the middle. I ordered the shrimp and grits and they were so good. So we're  the braised oxtails.But both weren't very warm. Our waiter was slow and I can only assume our plates sat for awhile.The restaurant itself is very cool and when sitting at the bar having a drink the service was great .I'll definitely go back again but I will sit and eat at the bar.
5/14/2017,4 star rating,"My wife and I went with another couple two nights ago. The restaurant is a little removed but there is a big parking lot close by which was nice. The restaurant looks great on the inside. I had the seafood chowder and braised oxtail. The soup had a lot of flavor and the oxtail was seasoned perfectly. My wife had the Crab cakes with collard greens and Mac and cheese. She really enjoyed her meals as well and I was impressed with the amount of crab used in her crab cakes, there was no filler.  Our friends enjoyed their food too.  It was great to eat some good southern cuisine in Detroit."
5/14/2017,1 star rating,"I had the worst dining experience of my life at Savannahblue.  After reading rave reviews for months, we got reservations as a celebration for my friend moving out of the state.  We arrived 15 min early and the front of the house told us to sit near the bar and they would get us.  30 min passed, I went back up and the hostess informed us their computer system was down so they didnt know we were there or what was going on with tables so to sit back down.  We waited another 15 minutes (now 30 min after our scheduled reservation) and finally someone came to help us find a table.Unfortunately, the experience only became worse as the night went on.  Our waiter dropped off menus, walked away, and 30 min passed with no help or contact.  He finally came and took out orders.  25 minutes pass, then the waiter came back out to inform us that the fried chicken and oxtail (ordered 25 min ago) was out so we had to make a different selection.  Another 45 minutes pass, no contact from the staff.  As it was 1.5 hrs since we sat down with no food, we stated we would leave and asked for our bill.  The manager handled the situation quite well and comped our meal and 10 minutes later we had food.The food was nothing special.  The boil was mussels in broth, no other ingredients.  The salmon was standard.  I would never recommend going to the restaurant, a huge disappointment.  I was mortified to bring people from out of town to the restaurant after boasting about the Detroit food scene for months as this was an utter embarrassment."
2/5/2016,5 star rating,"I haven't had such a fabulous meal in ages. Everything our server (Jin) recommended was delicious and filling. Savannah blue chop salad, the Annie flatbread and the crab cakes were decadent! Beautiful space with warm lighting and great music! I can't wait to come back next time I visit Detroit!"
6/24/2017,5 star rating,"The food was excellent. My wife had the seafood chowder to start and it was delicious. Nice balance of flavors, not too heavy and just enough sweetness.  She had the kale salad with grilled chicken and it was yummy too.  Lots and lots of chicken. I had the fried chicken and was yummy. Juicy but not to greasy. We had all our leftovers boxed to take home to enjoy tomorrow. It's a little hard to find the location but well worth it."
6/22/2017,5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite restaurants within the city. I love the shrimp and grits...the best I've had in the North. My husband loves the maple fried chicken. We've never had a bad meal here. There were some inconsistencies when they recently switched chefs but that  appears to have been resolved. Nice atmosphere, live entertainment in the evenings, excellent drinks (I include the sweet tea and fresh lemonade)."
3/24/2017,2 star rating,"Mehhhhhh. We had the black eyed pea hummus to start which was pretty good, but everything else was seriously just average. I got a house salad, and the fried chicken with fries. Chicken was fine, the fries were super limp and soggy. My boyfriend got the seafood boil and it was way way spicy! They were out of banana bread pudding at the end which was a bummer. Service was incredibly slow. Also our server didn't bring out the complimentary corn bread to our table either. way It was also very, very loud. Wished we could say we liked it but that's not the case this time. Would not recommend."
12/16/2017,3 star rating,"First and the last time!  Too many steps (24) to reach the 2nd floor restaurant and not handicapped accessible.  Staff friendly but not attentive and the waiter not familiar with the food choices, corn bread not served nor did they ask if we wanted dessert.  The peach cobbler was barely warm and the raw Oatmeal topping made it barely edible.  The greens were ""sweet"", black eyed peas and chicken was delicious.  Impossible to carry on a decent conversation - the dining room is too loud!"
3/13/2017,5 star rating,The service was outstanding and the food was finger licking good! We went as a group of 5 and most of everyone had left overs because of the big portion sizes. I had the oxtail dish which was delicious! The catfish bites are also very tasty! They play live music after 7pm in the bar/lounge area. Great spot for a date night or fancy dinner with friends/family.

2/29/2016,4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came for late dinner Saturday night, just weeks after their opening, I believe. I want to start by saying that the owner(s) are excellent and they picked a nice location. Savannah Blue has a good vibe, the set-up of the small space felt more like a lounge than a dining area, which may have been the goal. They had the basketball game playing on the TVs by the bar and the music was great. There were enough people to enhance the vibe, but not make us feel crowded, which led to a pretty good ambiance. Our waitress, however, was not great: it took a 15 minutes for us to get just her attention to ask for water and our appetizer, and she was very slow with our service and hard to find the entire dinner. However, the owner and the other staff noticed this and were more than compensatory for the waitress's service. The owner brought us free cocktails and apologized, and then continued to check on us and other customers all night, which felt like a good personal touch and great service. She made our dinner experience so much better.We ordered the house dry rub wings for an appetizer, which were pretty much excellent, especially with the molasses barbecue sauce. He ordered the twice dredged fried chicken and I got the Savannahblue burger. Our food was definitely 4/5, well seasoned and the portion sizes were proportional to the prices, which were also pretty fair. I was not asked by the waitress how I wanted my burger so it was brought out well done, but even well done it was good, and the fries were basically addictive. His suggestion for the chicken would be to not use boneless breasts, but overall, we had a good dinner. I would recommend Savannah Blue, hopefully our waitress was just having an off night. For only having been open a couple of weeks, this looks like a promising spot."

3/26/2016,5 star rating,"What a great addition to Detroit! I was so impressed with every aspect of this restaurant. The service was excellent- I'm vegan and they ran out of the succotash, but Chef Chris came to our table to discuss making a dish especially for me. And the dish he made was incredible!! My friends had the dry- rubbed wings, seafood broil, shrimp and grits, and the oxtail- and they all raved about everything. We finished with the peach cobbler which was the perfect end to a fantastic night. All topped off with a bottle of Conundrum wine. This place is super classy with Southern charm."
8/10/2016,3 star rating,"Food is very good; please bring the service up to match. Was there on a Wednesday with a visiting New York Times friend. Wasn't crowded. Gave our orders to two different waiters - some mix up. Then, waiter didn't show up that often as he was busy kicking it with familiar patrons. My colleague noted upon bill time that he never did get his ordered salad. I had to ask twice for lemon slices for water. I'll come back, at least once, for the food and nice ambience ... but please: let's do better service wise. The cuisine warrants it."
8/19/2018,5 star rating,"Restaurant was a little hard to find but once we got there it was a great overall experience. The ambiance was good, service was excellent and the food was great.

The food was seasoned well, good portion size and temperature. I will definitely return!!"
12/28/2018,5 star rating,"This place was incredible. An upscale southern style comfort restaurant that felt like a fancy night out with all your favorite foods. Great ambiance, great service. The Savannah Blue fried chicken and the braised ox tail were 10/10. We will definitely be back."

7/10/2017,5 star rating,"All of the food is awesome! This is my second time here, the first time I got the tried chicken breast with collards and sweet potatoes (which was really good). This time I got a cheeseburger --it may seem basic, but it was the best cheeseburger I have had in a very long time. I got it with a side of mac and cheese (it comes with fries but I only eat sweet potatoes fries) and that was good too. Next time I am going to try the oxtails!"

Atmosphere was super chill, food and drinks are a little pricey, but the quality of the food is really good.

Ordered the catfish fritters as an appetizer, the home made tarter sauce was great! Ordered the Ox Tail with cheesy risotto for my main course....DELICIOUS! Service was a bit slow, but they were busy, so that's understandable. Parking was also very difficult, but you're downtown so, that's to be expected. We will absolutely be back for another visit!"

She was very knowledgeable about the menu and made great suggestions. The seats were comfy. The music was cool and current. We had catfish fritters as an appetizer. For an entre: I had the shrimp and grits, she had the seared salmon. And for dessert the banana foster banana pudding with coffee. Everthing was delicious. The cocktails are good and strong too.

6/20/2016,4 star rating,"Dark and mysterious with a touch of jazz. A combination of a hipster jazz club and fine dining restaurant. My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and passing through town. We wanted someplace where we could get ambiance and enjoy a meal. If we could get a little music it would be nice. Surveying the ""nice"" restaurants downtown, we noticed that they are not open on this sleepy Monday. Eater Detroit identified this new, upstart establishment as an ""emerging"" hotspot. Looking on their well designed website (savannahbluedetroit.com) they were open on Mondays. Excellent. We noticed that they had live music - definite plus. Making our way through the maze of highways from Dearborn to center city, we were pleased with ample parking both behind the establishment and across the street. The unassuming building boasts a modest corner sign and glass entrance with frosting against a brick facade. Walking up the steps we entered into a casual lounge, the space filled with people socializing and the hum of live piano music in the background. The modern industrial decor was dimly lit, accented by candles strategically placed on tables. With a fully stocked bar, any cocktail imaginable could be materialized upon request. In my mind I thought, ""I could do this place on the regular.""Sitting in the dining area, we were pleased with its spaciousness and intimacy. We ordered glasses of wine. The selection is not deep, which was somewhat disappointing considering the depth of choices available of harder spirits. Our server brought four 2""x2"" squares of cornbread with the wine. Sweet and buttery, they were a foretaste of what we were in store for. Soon, before us was a crab cake appetizer. Having lived in Baltimore, I consider myself an amateur connoisseur of these delicacies. They boast of being a lump. I found them more shredded than what I have experienced from Maryland. Yet there was not an inordinate amount of filler found as I've seen from other establishments. Instead, it was chocked with meat. The sweetness of meat was contrasted very well with the vinegary flavor of the slaw and heat of the horseradish sauce. Two for two.For dinner we had the fried chicken breasts, collard greens and pureed sweet potatoes. The chicken was served with a maple jelly that provided a perfect sweetness to the well seasoned, crispy edible. The collard greens were gently seasoned with turkey with just the right blend to tartness. Combine this with the syrup sweet pureed sweet potatoes, you had a sensory rollercoaster of sweet, sour, tart and tangy. The portions were GINORMOUS. Served with two chicken breasts, the meal can definitely be shared. Three for three.To close the meal out I had the peach berry cobbler. To be honest, it was good, but not great. Frankly, at this point I was in sensory overload, stuffed to the gills, and unable to comfortably enjoy anything else. Three for four is not bad.My opinion of Savannah Blue? It is an excellent new edition to the restaurant scene. It is still finding itself but, it has the potential to make a serious dent in the dining/lounge scene of Detroit. It is a classy establishment that blends a hard, cool image with a dark, sensual atmosphere, with good food at an affordable price. Well worth the visit."
5/14/2016,5 star rating,"It was date night and my husband and I were looking to do dinner. We were down to three choices. And thanks to the great reviews of SavannahBlue and the fact that we could make reservations on Open Table, we went for it. Holy God. Did we ever make the right choice. Being greeted by a doorman was a charming touch. For those with mobility issues, there are stairs, as the restaurant is on the second floor. Not sure if there's an elevator. Once upstairs, the ambiance of the place was very nice. Slick, but not overly so. We were led through the vibrant bar area to a dining room that was bright with natural light. We started with a couple of cocktails. My husband had a Sidecar that almost ran him off the road. lol. After we ordered, our server (who was phenomenal!) brought us some delicious warm cornbread. Soon, our apps came. I started with the crab cake, ONLY because of another reviewer's comment that it was up there with Baltimore crab cakes. Now, as a DC native, that raised my eyebrows and I had to put it to the test as I've never had a great crab cake since I've lived here. It was amazing. Sweet jumbo lump and beautifully cooked. My husband was grateful that I shared it. He got the Caeser salad and loved it! Now, for the main event: the Oxtails! Ohhh emmm geee!!! I took a bite and moaned. And probably cussed. Soooo good! Now, it comes with risotto, but not being a huge risotto fan, I got it with mac and cheese, which isn't on the menu but was featured. It was very good, but tasting how good the oxtails were, I regretted not having the meal as the chef imagined it. My husband got the salmon--and they get extra points for asking how he'd like it cooked. He loved it! Like clean plate loved it. We were both very satisfied and I could only eat one of the oxtails. But you know I brought that bad boy home (with the rest of my mac and cheese!). It was only because I was too full that I didn't splurge and get dessert...I was eyeing the Bananas Foster.  At the end of the meal, we asked our waiter to pass along our compliments to the chef. And he said, ""Wait, there he is now,"" and brought him over to our table. He was warm, sincere and welcoming and it made our experience even more special that he took the time on a busy Friday night to talk with us. If you are reading this, please just go! It was host to a wonderful date night and will be again very soon! Chef McClendon, you are an absolute BEAST in the kitchen and your food--especially your oxtails--is a thing of beauty. The only problem I'll have next time is resisting the oxtails in favor of trying something new."
6/30/2016,5 star rating,Why anyone would give this under 5 stars is beyond me. The service was great the food was amazing! The overall atmosphere was chill and modern. The music was at a great volume. I can't say enough about this place we will return for sure!
9/25/2018,5 star rating,"I was on a business trip and found this place through yelp. I'm only here in detroit for another night, but I'm considering going back again because the food was just that good. I had the catfish bites as an appetizer and then went with the jambalaya. Both were great, and I had no problems with the service as mentioned in several reviews below. The bar staff and servers were attentive and had great personalities. Great stuff overall!"
9/23/2018,4 star rating,"My Friends and I dined here prior to a show at the Fox. They had our table ready and waiting when we arrived, drinks were great, and dinner was amazing! I indulged in the braised ox tail. From other reviews and photos it looks like the veggies vary from time to time, however my dish came with greens. I must say the tenderness of ox tail, savory greens, cheddar risotto, and the thin sweet potato crisps on top were an immaculate pairing! Although we had no room we absolutely had to try the  Beignets, as we were so impressed with EVERYTHING else. Unfortunately, these looked great on the outside but the floury taste on the inside was overwhelming. My husband and I both had one bite and left the others. This was the same insight that a reviewer provided from 2016, but I had hoped that the recipe was improved within the two year timeframe. Overall great dining experience and we will be back!"
11/5/2017,2 star rating,"Decided to check this place out on my birthday no less due to yelp reviews. So I will start with parking, it was 10 dollars to valet and 5 to park in lot that was around the corner from the restaurant. Secondly when we went in there was a stench in the stairwell and then you had to walk 2 flights of steep steps (definitely bad after a few drinks). We ate in the lounge area since we didn't have reservations  at 430 in the afternoon no less. I decided to order the braised oxtail and risotto that was recommended. Needless to say my risotto had to be sent back for not being done 2x . The 3rd time was the charm. My Sissi ordered the fried chicken and it was just ok, no seasoning ,just fried. Her greens and sweet potatoe side dish were cold... we are always up to try new things  and thought this would be nice but we both decided that we  weren't happy with the food. On a positive note, the waiter   was nice..."

5/8/2018,4 star rating,"The food was delicious and that is what the four star rating is for.   We came early 5:15, we had tickets at the Fox after.  No one was in the resturant yet.  My sister and I asked to sit, we checked the menu earlier and we're going to order for all four of us so when the other two  arrived we could eat right away.  She said we can't seat you until your entire party arrives.  I said, I understand but no one is here and my sisters are on the way.  We will order so it is ready when they get here, we have tickets after.  She said I'll check with the mananger.  No luck.   So the four of us ate at the bar surrounded with empty tables.  And the manager who we could see sitting at the end of the bar never got up and came over   Big fail!"
8/5/2016,5 star rating,Fantastic. Great food. Great service. We started at the bar and I hated my drink. I was perfectly happy to pay for it. Ot was made properly but I didn't like it. So I knew o wouldn't order it again. I paid and the bartender insisted that I get another drink instead at no cost!!!! Awesome right? Black eye pea hummus is awesome as is the shrimp and grits and the fried chicken cooked just right. This place is a must try!

The Sweet potato side was so creamy and tasty and the sautéed spinach was perfect!  The shrimp and grits were also amazing as was the macaroni and cheese side.  All large portions and all very delicious!  We were too full to even try the dessert!  The atmosphere was very nice. It was quiet and  dimly lit with views of the people mover. We had terrific service  from our waiter, Ricardo as well. We enjoyed cocktails and dinner was served in a timely manner.  A very enjoyable evening! Would definitely go back!  This is a gem of a restaurant!"

9/30/2017,5 star rating,"I'd wanted to take my southern friend to a classy soul food restaurant and thought SavannahBlue will be perfect. I called ahead to inquire about vegan options and was told that there were no vegan entrees but after the manager spoke to the chef, I received a call back stating that the chef was up for the challenge. Our dinner was amazing. The ambiance was exquisite. The management and staff were extremely attentive, comforting, sweet and professional. The food and drinks were top notch and I cannot thank SavannahBlue enough for taking care of us including making a custom dish for my partner. The vibe was perfect. I'd highly recommend SavannahBlue to anyone I meet."

Don't forget to try the mac & cheese too!
8/5/2016,3 star rating,"With so many great restaurant options in Detroit, I wouldn't return to this one.  Everything tasted just ok, nothing special.  Our waiter actually went over his favorites and just listed the entrees in order of price, starting with the highest.  Service was pretty slow and the place wasn't very busy for a Friday night."
4/6/2018,5 star rating,Came to Savannah Blue today for first time and I must say I love the atmosphere. I love the shrimp and homemade fries. The menu is reasonable and music was cool. This is a must visit spot. I will visit again soon
7/2/2018,5 star rating,"Delicious food! Loved the Georgian hummus, seared salmon, collard greens, cheddar risotto... could go on and on. Lovely cocktails were a bonus!"
3/29/2018,5 star rating,"This place was fantastic. I was in Detroit on business and one of my local colleagues recommended it. I had the fried chicken with collards and candied yams, which was fantastic. Chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, collards were cooked perfectly and the candied yams were amazing. My colleagues got the jambalaya and loved it. We couldn't resist the beignets, and those were great as well. Staff was also very friendly and had excellent knowledge of the menu and drink options. Will absolutely be back next time I'm in town!"
9/19/2016,4 star rating,"Very sexy space. The bar area is gorgeous while the dining room could really use an upgrade to the tables, chairs and decor. The food was very good, not great. I'm finding that's typical of places that try to get fancy with southern comfort food. Catfish was a big hit."
2/26/2016,4 star rating,"We're here from Durham,NC on an extended work assignment. We had a very satisfying experience. Service was top notch. Fried chicken was the best I've had in Detroit. Collard greens were authentic. Excellent cocktails. Generous portions.  Warm atmosphere. We'll be back."

4/23/2017,3 star rating,"I've heard that this was a great place to try for the food, drinks, and ambience. I tried this place out with a group of friends in a Saturday night and I was so bummed about my experience. It took 30 minutes to get our drinks, an hour and a half for food, and all of our bills were incorrect. My food was cold and side dishes over baked. The management was very apologetic and compensated for our dinner. However, when our server brought our drink bill he gave me one price and charged me another. I was so furious at this point that I was just ready to leave. It seems that there is great potential in this place, but a lot of progress to be made to accommodate the capacity they're built to serve. Needless to say I won't be going back. The price does not reflect the quality of food or service I received."
4/21/2016,5 star rating,"Had a wonderful time. Great food. The waiter was exceptional. We shared the shrimp Alfredo flat bread, oxtail with risotto and shrimp with grits. All of it was very clean and tasted really good. The spiked Arnold Palmer cocktail was right up my alley. The cobbler was a perfect end to an amazing meal."
4/16/2018,5 star rating,"This was the most amazing food I've eaten in a while. Unexpectedly getting cornbread with a warm butter glaze on top. To. Die. For. Along with the collard greens, catfish, jambalaya real down to earth restaurant great atmosphere. Would recommend"

3/26/2018,2 star rating,Great ambiance and great waitstaff (Byron)!  My husband ordered collard greens as one of his sides and plastic wrapping was cooked and found in his greens which is a carcinogen (health hazard).  The Manager came to apologize and was very nonchalant about the situation and said she was willing to replace the dish of collard greens.  She was told we didn't want another order of collard greens (I assume cooked from the same batch).  We asked was there anything else she could do and she replied she could adjust the bill taking 50% off my husband's meal only.  Will I go back to eat at SavannaBlue?  Shoulder shrug......absolutely not!

4/29/2019,1 star rating,"I made reservations for a Saturday evening at 7PM for 4 guests (using the Open Table app). I typed in the special accommodations box (in the app) I would like to add 2 more guests (to the reservation) because the 4 guest selection was unavailable. I tried calling the restaurant to make them aware of the request, but the voicemail was full. I tried calling them on another day, but to no avail. I checked the Open Table app to see if they tried to reach out to me there. Nothing, no response.  Fast forward to Saturday and I arrive a few minutes ahead of time before my other guests. The hostess asked do you have reservations? I said for 7PM with 4 guests. I gave them my name and I said I tried calling and texting in the app to notify the restaurant in advance that the reservation was for 4. She informed me that they could not seat 4 guests. I responsed to her by saying, again, that I tried to call the restaurant in advance two times to confirm the reservation of 4 and if I knew that it couldn't, I would've cancelled and went elsewhere. She said you can speak to the manager. The manager asks what was the problem. I explained the situation and he said ""We don't check the Open Table app"". Why would any reputable restaurant use the Open Table app for reservations, but then not check the reservations being made? My friends and I had planned a girls night out and specifically wanted to solicit a black owned restaurant. We all drove from Oakland County, no where near downtown Detroit. The manager did eventually accommodate our party  ""only because another party canceled"" The unprofessionalism of the hostess and the manager, in addition to the jean wearing teeny boppers that now solicit this restaurant made it so that I will never, ever return!"

4/11/2018,1 star rating,"Don't bother even going there.  Before you even walk in the door they charge you for ""parking"".  Really?  Not worth your time or money.  Especially the money.  So many other places to go to in Detroit.  This is not one of them."
8/2/2016,3 star rating,"I took my boyfriend to Savannah Blue last night for his birtday. As we pulled up there was a sign that said ""valet"" but it leads you to a parking lot in the back which was five dollars. We exited the car and walked past a smelly dumpster with a rat trap near the brick wall. As we entered the building we were impressed by the dark decor. We went up a flight of stairs and were greeted by two very kind people. As we entered the restaurant, visually it was very appealing and there was a woman playing the piano. We were escorted to the back area of the restaurant where we sat by the window. Our server was very kind and polite however the margarita I ordered initially had salt on the rim and it tasted as if salt was dumped into my drink. I of course, ask for another margarita and it was not very tasty. Although the service was excellent the food was below average. My overpriced salmon and half cup of spinach was very salty. The pureed sweet potatoes we're average. My boyfriend ordered shrimp which was also salty and he had a flatbread pizza which tasted like the frozen pizzas I used to eat when I was a child. His martini was well made and very strong however I did not want to order any more drinks. As far as food goes, the best part of the meal was the hot cornbread. Between the both of us we spent over $100 and it was not worth it. I'm glad we tried it but I would never want to eat there again."
4/3/2018,2 star rating,"Dear Savannah Blue,I'm writing to share a very disappointing experience I had with you on Saturday, March 24, 2018. I previously posted this write-up by privately messaging you on Facebook. I saw that someone read my message the same day it was posted, and never responded. I sent a follow-up message asking if you were going to respond a week later. Someone read that post, and never responded, so I'm posting it again here. I made reservations for 5pm on March 24, 2018 for a party of four. The occasion was the celebration of my very close friend's birthday. This was the fourth time I dined with Savannah Blue (although my first time in the actual dining room), and my fifth visit overall. On all the previous occasions, I experienced nothing but professionalism, good service, good times, good drinks, and good food. However, this time was different - based on one huge mistake and the response from one person in a position to rectify the mistake - Leah, who I believe was the manager on duty that evening.My boyfriend and I were treating our friends (a husband and wife) to dinner in honor of the wife's birthday. As part of her gift, we gave her a key lime pie (which was not on the Savannah Blue menu when I checked ahead of time), as that is her favorite dessert. Everyone who greeted us and took our coats were great. Our server, Byron, was very, very good, personable and responsive. I asked him when we sat down whether Savannah Blue could cut the key lime pie for us at the end of our meal. He agreed that it was possible, and there would be a $20 cutting fee. I declined to accept, as the pie only cost $17 and it didn't make sense to pay more than what the pie cost just to cut it.We began our meal with a round of drinks (all prepared to our liking) and two of the diners ordered gumbo/soup, which they enjoyed. The cornbread arrived hot and buttery. When we received our entrees, collectively we were enjoying our meals, until...one of the gentleman at the table discovered a large, triangular (about 2 inches or so) piece of plastic in his collard greens. It appeared to be a corner cut from a bag. We motioned for Byron and explained what happened. He took the piece of plastic on a plate, and explained that he would speak with the manager and show her the plastic. A few minutes later, a woman named Leah came over to our table (she did not initially offer her name to us as one would expect in dealing with a customer issue). She seemed rather unbothered by the fact that a large piece of plastic bag was cooked in the greens, and surmised that it came from the bag the greens were in before being cooked. She offered to provide our friend with another order of greens (from the same batch, I guess?). He declined. It was only after I inquired whether anything could be done to rectify the situation that she said that she would take 50% off the one guest's meal (his wife and I had also ordered collard greens and they were visible on our plates, but Leah didn't bother to offer the same for us). Her offer amounted to about $11.After Leah left the table, all of us discussed how stunned we were that Leah did not seem to be very concerned about the piece of plastic being cooked in with the greens. The table was appalled by what happened, as well as the lack of concern expressed by Leah. The whole table is also aware that you should not heat food in plastic in a microwave as it could become a toxin, a carcinogen, so you probably shouldn't cook it in your food, either. When Byron returned, I asked him whether in addition to the $11 being taken off our nearly $200 check, we could also receive the pie cutting for free. He said he would check with the manager again. When he returned, he said that he could offer $10 off the $20 fee. This was very surprising as a pie cutting is not asking for any additional resources other than a few quick cuts to a pie - we weren't asking for additional food, dessert, or anything of that nature.This experience left us all feeling rather ""nickled and dimed"" over a matter that could have been resolved easily and, if handled well, could have easily left each of us feeling more loyal to your business than when we walked in. Instead, we left feeling dispirited and much less likely to recommend this option to our friends (they often inquire of my boyfriend and me where to go in Detroit for great food and experiences, as we try to dine everywhere and write our own personal reviews on social media to well over 1000 people), whereas we previously encouraged several people to try Savannah Blue. Perhaps losing our business and the business of our friends will not amount to much for Savannah Blue. I'm just disappointed that the customer service and action taken on behalf of the manager were far less than optimal, and that our concern did not appear to be taken seriously - at that time or since then."

From the corn bread starter to the chocolate cake for dessert we were in heaven.  My boyfriend had the seafood boil and this dish exceeded his expectations...and he's southern!  I had the fried chicken with candied yams and collard greens, which was equally delicious and came with a generous portion.  Great gem that I would encourage you to try!"
8/6/2017,3 star rating,Very nice atmosphere. Very loud. Decided we were going to order fried chicken. Waiter came to take order and told us they were out of fried chicken. It was 8:30 on a Saturday night. Very frustrating. Chopped salad wasn't great. Chicken wing appetizer was good- not great. Shrimp and grits was really good. Glad I tried it-probably won't go back.
7/28/2017,2 star rating,"We have been really excited to try this place for a while, but I have to say we were disappointed. The menu and the atmosphere were great, but we waited an hour (literally an hour) for our food. We watched two separate tables get there after us, order, eat and leave before our food came. The worst part was the waiter didn't even acknowledge the fact that we waited that long. I got the oxtail which was good, but there was hardly any meat on the bones. The cheddar risotto was the best part. My boyfriend got the seafood boil and said it was meh. Overpriced for the amount/quality of the food. We really wanted this place to be better, but unfortunately it wasn't a good experience."
3/21/2016,4 star rating,"The only reason that I didn't rate this restaurant a 5 is because my wife and i didn't have an entree. We came in early this past Saturday evening, and were immediately greeted by Perry, the bartender extraordinaire (more later). That set the tone for the rest of the experience. First, it's a beautiful setting, dimly lit, and a fairly large comfortable lounge area. We decided to give the crab cake appetizer a try, since other reviewers raved about them. We were definitely glad that we did! It was everything everyone had previously described, not 'bready', full of large chunks of crab, lightly breaded and a great dipping sauce. My wife chose 7 Falls Cab, which we've had in the past and think it's great. I mention that because it seems the only places you can buy this wine in the Detroit area, is at a restaurant. I contacted the winery directly and that's what I was informed.As we began talking to Perry, we discovered that we were both 'Doughboys' and had lived blocks apart from each other growing up. Very cool and it certainly added to the overall experience.Rather than have dinner there (had made previous reservations) we decided that we would come back later in the evening to try the dessert menu (as another reviewer had mentioned doing) and check out the late evening crowd and atmosphere. It was even better!Great background music that created an exciting atmosphere and ambience. Perry immediately greeted us, like old friends and we again sat at the bar to enjoy a dessert. While sitting there, we were warmly greeted by the co-owners, Tanya and John and it was quickly apparent, ""they get it"". Great conversationalists, interesting backgrounds and seemingly caring people. Tanya was especially appreciative of my wife's mentioning that the atmosphere was fantastic. Tanya described their goal of creating a 'family' ambience and they certainly hit the mark.We will return and enjoy a dinner very soon, maybe even this coming weekend!Tom & Terry"
2/3/2017,5 star rating,"I decided to stop by SavannahBlue for dinner before a concert, and they completely exceeded my expectations.  Loved the modern decor and atmosphere.  The service was good and the food was excellent!  I highly recommend the braised oxtail!  Meat cooked perfectly and it sat on a bed of delicious cheddar risotto.  But what really pulled the whole dish together was the sauce!  The fried chicken was perfectly fried and meat was moist.  The yams on the side were okay, as was the side of mac n cheese I added, nothing special though compared to the chicken.  Another plus - they're conveniently located near the Times Square people mover entrance."
5/22/2018,1 star rating,"I went to SB on 5/18/18 during the happy hour and this had to be some of the worst service I've ever received from any restaurant. My fiancée and myself had our appetizer order taken by one person. She put the order in and never came back to see if we needed anything even though she came back to our side of the bar. We asked her to come back when she had a second, said ok, and simply didn't. We had a second waitress take our second order but made it seem like we were inconveniencing her. After we had our food, we wanted to order dessert but no one came to check on us. Mind you, we were sitting AT THE BAR where there were at least 5 waitresses/bar tenders there but not giving us the time of day. We cashed out and had the receipt and our change tossed at me. I'm not exaggerating, the waitress tossed the clip at me and went on to service people that weren't inconveniencing her. The food was spectacular but the service was so bad that I can't step foot back in there and wouldn't advise anyone to spend money there."
8/20/2016,2 star rating,"Yelp showed them open until midnight. We arrived at 11:38 and upon being seated were told the kitchen would close in 15 minutes.  We should have taken the hint as our waitperson was just not into making us feel welcome. Two bowls of clam chowder, while quit tasty were not served together and after asking for the first to be reheated, both were served together but still just warm. When the hot teas arrived luke warm, we decided that I must be intentional on the part of a rogue waitperson. We concur with others on the fried chicken; the bbq chicken flat bread was very tasty, great ambiance / vibe."
7/10/2016,5 star rating,"Excellent restaurant.  I didn't expect to be giving this restaurant a five star rating before we went there but it really does deserve it. The restaurant itself is nicely done with sort of a classy, industrial feel for lack of a better description.  You would feel comfortable dressed up or down.  We started with the crab cakes which are without question the best I've ever eaten. The same goes for the cornbread.  It's too often dried out, but not here.  We then had ""The Boss"" flatbread and the fried shrimp.  Both were excellent.  The cocktails were good and the service top notch.  Our waiter was Namir and he didn't miss a beat.  If I had to complain about anything it would be that the shrimp was $25 for only five pieces so definitely on the high side but that is a minor complaint at best.  Overall an excellent new addition to the Detroit restaurant scene and looking forward to going back."
9/13/2016,5 star rating,"Wow! My boyfriend took me to Savannah Blue last weekend and I was thoroughly impressed! From my appetizer, my wine and my steak dinner..5 stars all around! Loved the ambiance as well. We will definitely be back. There are so many other entrees I'd like to try. Nice job!"
6/4/2017,4 star rating,"Great place, although last time I went, the service wasn't great (forgot to bring our appetizer, something under the table got on my friend's pants and they didn't offer her a drink or a dessert or to cover her dry cleaning). The salmon and the chicken wings are both amazing. I met the chef one time and he was great."
5/19/2017,5 star rating,"Lemme start off with our server was amazing, Chauncey knew everything on the menu and what this place was about.  The Food was bonkers, oxtail was amazing and my lady ordered the Shrimp and Grits without the sausage and yet came out with every flavor profile one would want.  I have to say O am totally making an effort to come back."
8/11/2018,2 star rating,"Went to Savannah Blue for my husband's birthday. I read the reviews prior to making reservations and thought I was in for a treat! Unfortunately, I we did not have a great experience as hoped. I ordered the shrimp and grits. My meal was tasty. My husband, the birthday boy ordered Catfish which came with two sides for $23. He ordered two sides of mac and cheese. The mac and cheese came out burnt! It was scorched on the top and dry in the middle. He asked the waitress if it was supposed to look that way and if it was, he would request a different side. The waitress reported that it was not supposed to be burned. My husband was then told by the manager who further handled the situation that new mac would be prepared. The manager took the mac to the back and left the fish with my husband at the table. It took roughly 15 minutes or more to receive his mac and cheese at which point his fish was cold and I was finished with my meal. My husband took his meal to go. No comps were given and no apologies for the wait on the meal were given either. After we complained to the manager again about the length of time it took. We got an apology and that was all. Needless to say, we wont be back. Sad because the decor and ambiance is great. Wish we could have had a better experience especially for my husbands b day dinner."

9/18/2016,5 star rating,"Savannah Blue is by far some of the best food I've had in awhile! I'm obsessed. Already have plans to take my Aunt and in-laws out for a night on the town and this is where I am taking them. Everyone needs to know how amazing this food is! The Moscow Mule was also perfect (I don't even like them normally, but I could drink 100 of these!) The service was also on spot. So many people attentive to our table making sure we had what we needed. The time it took to get our food was longer than that of a chain restaurant, but the atmosphere of the restaurant and the quality of the food shows to be worth the wait. I'd wait again and again for the crab cakes! Needless to say, this one is a definite favorite!"

I can't say enough about the place, the ambiance, the oxtail risotto, the crab cake! Oh the hummus! Thank you to our server and thank you for being so hospitable."
8/21/2016,2 star rating,I have to say this place left a bad taste in my mouth. I heard a lot of good things about this place. The food was just ok. First: I ordered the jumbo crab cakes the one cake came out cold in the middle. I told my husband that it taste like frozen food. The shrimp and grits could have taste better. Thought that it would have had more shrimp in it. Second: the service was really slow. We didn't understand why when it was not busy at all. There were only a few tables occupied. I wanted to order dessert but didn't want to be there any longer. When we left the restaurant our waiter was talking to the other servers. I see why everything took so long.
7/29/2016,2 star rating,I ordered the fried shrimp and was served something that clearly looked like the kids platter with very small shrimp.  For $25 I had a higher expectation.  Greens and mac and cheese were good.  My mom's friend chicken was fried way too hard which made it very dry. Not planning to return.

7/12/2016,5 star rating,"This is the first review I have ever written on Yelp, but we had such a great experience at this little gem of a restaurant I wanted to tell the world! hah. Being New Yorkers living in Detroit, it is not often that we have the pleasure of discovering new, local places that really impress us (outside of the places we already love, Selden, Mabel, etc) But we loved Savannah Blue and are excited to go back and try everything else! My boyfriend and I had a very reasonably priced,lovely bottle of pinot noir, we shared the rib starter (was a special that night), we split the Ox tail, and the fried chicken entree. Everything was perfect! Ribs big and moist, Ox tail super flavorful and huge portion, fried chicken was fried in some of the most delicious batter i have ever had. Our server Lee, guided us through the wine list and menu with wit and knowledge! The place had a nice little crowd, great ambiance, looking forward to going back and trying more."
3/13/2016,5 star rating,"We stopped in for a drink and an app on a Friday night. The bartenders were extremely friendly and full of wonderful suggestions. We tried the fried chicken with the pecan maple drizzle. We couldn't get enough! The atmosphere was fun and lively, the service was warm and inviting and the food was amazing. We saw someone next to us enjoying the jumbo crab cake - looked equally delicious. We will be back!"
1/22/2017,3 star rating,"I wasn't completely thrilled with my meal, but I'd definitely like to go back to try other things.  We ordered the chopped salad and it was ok.  It needed more of the toppings--the toppings to lettuce ratio was really not on point.  It also needed more dressing.  I really wanted to try the fried green tomatoes, but they weren't in season so I couldn't.  I had the shrimp and grits.  The grits came in a little cake on the bottom of everything.  I am quite familiar with south carolina shrimp and grits and this was not up to par.  I would have preferred a bunch of creamy grits, not in a cake.  But overall the grits tasted fine.  The shrimp and everything else was ok but extremely spicy.  Just too spicy.  There were also tomatoes in it, which didn't make sense to me.  I wouldn't get this dish again.  I do want to try the oxtail, though.  My husband got the fried chicken, which I enjoyed.  He didn't care much for it though.  The greens were okay--kind of salty/vinegary, but I liked them fine.  The sweet potato soufflé was pretty terrible--it had so much cinnamon in it that it was actually spicy.  We couldn't get dessert because most of the options were unavailable.  Service was great, though, although they didn't pack up our cornbread for us with our other leftovers so that was a bummer."
4/16/2016,5 star rating,"Wanted to try this new venue, wasn't really impressed by the menu but tried it anyway. Totally impressed with the the customer service and our bartenders menu suggestions.

3/3/2016,1 star rating,"If you don't do stairs, forget about this restaurant! Walk in the front door and all there is are two flights of stairs; so much for the old, the weak, or the unification of Detroit. These entrepreneurs should be ASHAMED of themselves!"
6/11/2017,3 star rating,We went here for dinner with another couple. The food was its saving grace. My friend really liked the fried chicken. I thought the breading was extremely salty.  My husband's shrimp and grits were delicious. My other friend liked her crab cakes. The rest of the experience was a thumbs down. The waiter was a young man who barely spoke above a whisper.  The music was so loud we missed half of what he did say. When he filled our water glasses he spilled all over the table and didn't apologize or bother to wipe it up.  It took forever for him to bring our drinks.  He spilled my friend's drink in my water and just laughed when I brought it to his attention.  The food also took an extremely long time to arrive.  I only ate half of my dinner and he offered to box it. When I got home I discovered he didn't put one of the sides in the box.  That was one of the things I liked too.  All in all a disappointment.
2/7/2017,3 star rating,"This was my first experience at Savannah Blue, and if I were to return, it would be strictly for the ambiance and drinks. I was there for an 8pm reservation however, the reservation was mistakenly made by restaurant staff for 9pm. Ok, mistakes occur. Once seated, the waitress came right over and was super  sweet (can't remember her name). Our table was able to order drinks and food within a timely manner, and the food came out in a decent time however,  the food was just not that great. I ordered the appetizer chicken wings and garlic smashed potatoes, and both were cold. The other 5 guests at the table also agreed that their food wasn't hot either. My friend ordered the sweet potatoes, but asked the waitress to bring her butter and brown sugar so that she could ""doctor"" them up.  Overall, I think this place has good potential, they just need to tighten up on a few things to ensure future success and recurring patrons!"
5/22/2016,2 star rating,"I had an unfortunate experience here. We were sat in a lovely booth and then moments after settling in told we had to move to make room for some folks with an online reservation. Errr... Huh? We made our reservations online as well! Anyhow. We complied and were moved to a freezing cold table against the wall. Cold air was literally blasting in at me. I was shivering the whole time. Our server was so rude it was almost comical. He was dismissive and uninterested. Didn't bother to list the specials off or check on us. So cold and rude. The restrooms were pretty dirty. They don't have someone monitoring them and it shows. The place is pretentious without the goods to back it up. A side of fries was served with no sauce. 5 fries on a plate, no sauce at all, for 5 or 6 bucks. I would've paid 10 for quality fries plus sauce. The staff that wander around don't seem to be doing anything other than looking important. My water glass sat empty and no one checked on us for close to an hour while I froze by the window. I wanted to like this place! I would only go to the bar here going forward."
7/5/2016,2 star rating,"Disappointed. I wanted to love it based on reviews but the service was severely lacking. The food was okay but the shrimp and grits had 3 medium sized shrimp for $25! We asked the waiter if it was supposed to have more shrimp so he went to ask the kitchen and came back and said it should have 4 so they're making another. Wow, thanks. We noticed other tables receiving cornbread and after not receiving any after finishing our appetizer we asked if we could have some cornbread as well, it seemed as though they had no intention of ever bringing it without us asking and then they brought out 3 pieces when EVERY other table of 2 was served 4 pieces. The consistency of the portions and service left much to be desired. We were never offered a second round of drinks or dessert but by the end of the entree I just wanted to leave as fast as possible, of course that was drawn out and it took forever to receive the check. There are many hot new places in Detroit competing for your service, I wouldn't recommend you waste your time and money here."
