3.5 star rating,"A childhood friend and I met here to have brunch and catch up. I had made the reservation for us at 1PM. There wasn't a clear designation of where the hostess area was and there were a number of parties waiting to be seated. We navigated around them and stood in what we thought to be the appropriate to be seen by staff. This gave a view of the kitchen area which was bustling as food was being prepared. A young lady approached immediately after observing us and I let her know we had a reservation. After a brief moment, she located it in the system and seated us. Our waiter came over and greeted us and we asked for a moment to peruse the menu as it was the first time for each of us there. We both were both still undecided when he returned and he answered our questions to help us decided. My friend had the Steak + Egg Hash while I settled on the Wings + Waffles. I was happy that we had asked about the entrées upfront as the description for the Steak + Egg Hash was quite appetizing until he mentioned it to be spicy which I hadn't anticipated from reading the menu. My friend confirmed it was quite spicy when our food arrived. My syrup had a slice of jalapeño pepper in it that I promptly removed. The wings were well seasoned and crispy. The Belgian waffle was delicious as well. We had mimosas to top off the meal and shared a Chocolate Molten Lava cake for dessert. The experience overall was very delightful and I will return."
4 star rating,"The food is great but not for the price. Even the ambiance is sub-par and not what you'd expect for the $$$. Drinks were good but, then again, expensive for what you're getting and what is available around you. Staff is amiable when they actually serve you... that being said, 20% gratuity is added right when you walk in the door regardless of party size. I had to go to the host to get our server back to the table, which I wouldn't expect for that forced gratuity. I usually always tip 25%, and I understand the concept, but I felt conned when we weren't helped or asked about our dish until the checks came, which, again, we didn't ask for at that time. Felt very rushed and unwelcome, and therefore I didn't tip a cent more. Sad because this place does have great potential being right in Detroit."
3 star rating,"I've been to Central Kitchen + Bar many times, but never for brunch. We were able to grab a seat on their heated patio, which gives you a great shot of the Campus Martius tree. After a round of cocktails, we ordered a couple burgers, wings and waffles, and the brioche french toast. The waffles came with a jalapeño maple syrup that was a great way to step up a brunch favorite. The burger had a tomato jam that was so fresh."
5 star rating,"Excellent brunch spot with $0.25 mimosa refills. They have a nice heated porch area that allows you to see some of downtown, but you can't go wrong sitting at the bar either. The hours are limited but the menu is pretty diverse. This is a great spot for 2-4 people, a larger group may have some difficulty with seating."
4 star rating,"This was my 1st time coming and and it was AMAZING!!We had the chef's special omelet (salmon & feta) and it was so delicious, we ordered it twice. The steak and potatoes were also great. We ate it immediately, so we couldn't even take pictures. Definitely worth the 5 stars! Great place."
5 star rating,"Horrible venue.  Owned by Dennis Archer Jr.  my bill was probably the highest that day.  We were still ordering drinks and food and the hostess came and asked us to leave because we were there for 90 minutes.  The rudest experience ever.  Im trying to support black own businesses but there's always something that ruins it.  Dennis please get this business together before you have no business.  Food was sub-par and drinks could be better.  Word of advise to everyone, do go there if you are trying to have a chill and relax time.  Every table is on a time limit.  Horrible experience.  I would never come back!!!!"
1 star rating,"Look, I really fucking hate the concept of brunch. portions usually suck and the food is usually lackluster but the meal I had here was fucking fantastic. the brunch of my dreams. 10/10 recommend."
5 star rating,"Huge disappointment.   Had Detroit burger and couldn't even eat it.    Ordered medium and was served raw.   Weird flavor too.    ""Homemade"" chips served with burger were stale.    Do not recommend at all .    Tip was automatically added to bill and we received poor service.    Disappointing"
1 star rating,"Today we came here to celebrate my father's 88th birthday. It was a wonderful event, made extra special by the care and attention of our server Norris. His skill, attention to detail and patience in helping my parents have a delightful experience in a city they love and have missed. Please give Norris a raise, he is a treasure and it would be a shame to lose him!"
5 star rating,"Service was top notch.  Although we had reservations it was still a 20 minute wait on top of that.  They were slappin.  The food was pretty on point and the ambiance was nice.  A little loud but that was because it was a full house.  Overall, I enjoyed myself."
3.5 star rating,"Loved dinner time! Service was amazing and the food was fantastic. I definitely enjoyed my dinner time experience way more than my brunch! The atmosphere was just better, less crowded, and loud."
5 star rating,Staff wear masks and they try their best to accommodate guest which trying to social distance. They still have their patio room opened with heaters. Their servers are nice and helpful. I went for brunch and it was amazing!!! Chicken and waffles is highly recommended
4 star rating,"Continually unimpressed with the Detroit food scene.We waited around for 15 minutes before the busboy noticed us and told our server ""table 48! table 48!"" When we asked if he was our server, pretty sure he lied when he said ""no I'm not"" because he continued to serve us and never found our ""actual"" server.We asked for fries to snack on while we waited. They ended up bringing us the fries along with our meals. Guessing they forgot about the fries until then.The house burger was ok--not a ton of flavor. I tried the chicken sandwich as well--probably the blandest chicken sandwich I've ever eaten.Had to sniff some coffee beans when I got home to make sure I wasn't losing my sense of taste. Nope, it was just the food at Central Kitchen.Also, they add a 19% tip to the bill by default. Not a fan of that."
3 star rating,VERY RUDE STAFF. Don't waste your money on this business! Steer clear of this place.....
1 star rating,"We wandered into Central Kitchen + Bar over a weekend in Detroit and could not have been more pleased with our experience. The staff was spectacular and the food was out of this world.   They seated us in advance of our reservation, and we're clear about offerings in the off hours between lunch and dinner - which was helpful in planning our afternoon.  I can not overstate how amazing our food was during the dinner hour (steak frites and a Bolognese). Wish there were more stars available! Thank you for the warm welcome, the delicious dinner and the great throwback music."
5 star rating,"The entire staff earned this review. It's getting less and less common to be treated like you matter in restaurants  lately but that was not the case here at all. We had a party of 8 from brunch late Sunday afternoon and it was fantastic. Mimosa's, Bloody Mary, shrimp tacos ( hands down the best crispy shrimp taco I've had) salmon flatbread, burgers , cherry chocolate crepes, French toast, steak and eggs hash, power salad, fries...we had most of the menu including a caramel cheesecake and chocolate lava cake and all of it was top notch. Gotta give a special shout out to our server Alejandro. We all felt very valued by the great service. Hostesses and, of course the kitchen crew earned those 5 stars. Great experience all the way around. Be prepared, it's busy and it's pretty loud inside, can't say what it's like in the atrium. City garage is easy and close by."
5 star rating,"[This meal occurred pre-COVID]On my typical lunchtime wanderings (even in the dead of winter), I stumbled across this restaurant. Since I had a meeting to get to immediately after lunch, I was mindful to find a place that offered a quick option. The hostess assured me that their lunch service is quick. And it was.The menu is limited to a few broad categories: salads and soups, burgers, and tacos. There were also a few starters. Since I was watching my carbs, the burgers and tacos were out. Instead, I went with the salad. I like both beets and Brussels sprouts and was curious about salads where they were the main ingredients. However, the Ahi Tuna salad with avocado and edamame sounded more interesting.The portion was on the smaller side and had only a few ounces of raw tuna tossed in. I liked the variety in the ingredients: string beans, cashews, and wasabi peas. I should have ordered it without the crispy noodles - it was tough to eat around.Bar seating was uncomfortable."
3 star rating,we sat at the bar. We ordered a burger and fries and a salad and 2 drinks. It was overpriced forsure and the service was off. We asked for our bill and the bartender automatically put 20% for tip on our bill. I would have tipped 20% regardless but it was still very weird. I went there in the fall and it was much better but after this experience I won't be back for awhile
3 star rating,"Came here for a birthday brunch last weekend and I really enjoyed it! Pricing is fair for restaurants nowadays downtown and you do get a good portion of food. We had a party of 10 and service was great. Food was brought out honestly pretty quick. I just wish there were more options on the menu (for brunch at least). Saying that, there is something for everyone (vegans included, but it's just avocado toast). Just a heads up, parking is kind of a nightmare now. There are structures in the area, but if you're like me and refuse to pay a lot for parking, there is more street parking closer to Greektown/Saint Andrews. Just pay attention to signs!"
4 star rating,Haven't even sat down yet and i feel like i need to leave a review because the host Casey is the nicest person i have ever met and this was the friendliest person i have ever met. went above and beyond to let us in the bathroom and was just over the top while we waited. Nicest group of employees.
5 star rating,"Went with a friend to this place for the first time. Cool vibe. The music is a bit loud but you could still hear each other talk. We ordered 4 share plates. The calamari was very good. It had a twist done with snap peas, peppers, jalapeños, oranges, cashews, cilantro and sweet soy sauce glaze. Very good and some heat. Then we ordered steak tip and herb season fries. The steak tips were also unique. It had peppers, peanuts, edamame, scallions in a peanut sauce with cellophane noodles atop. Very good! And the fig pizza with Brussels sprouts, goat cheese, fig spread and balsamic was outstanding on a very thin crust. Service was excellent! Nice pours on the wine. I will go back. You can park in Detroit One parking lot and they will stamp your ticket for 2 hours of parking free."
3.5 star rating,"Food was AMAZING!Service could have been a bit more organized/and attentive, but food was INCREDIBLE!"
5 star rating,"My family and I went to Central Kitchen today, March 16 around 5:30pm. This was all our first time here and it was great! The service was perfect from our server Elizabeth! There was a slight misunderstanding with one person in our party and Cristy, but she came over and apologized as well as sent us two desserts. That definitely enhanced our experience because it shows they care about their customers and it's not just about the money. We ordered the calamari which was done different than what we normally eat, but it was DELICIOUS! We also had the House Burgers, Chicken Sandwiches, Shrimp Tacos and Refresher Course for a drink, for one person. It was definitely a great way to start off our Easter Weekend with family. We will for sure be back. Absolutely loved the food, service, and the atmosphere. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!"
5 star rating,"They need to expand their brunch offering. I know, first world problems, but even a coney let's you customize your omelette. Atmosphere is ok. But too crowded for a relaxing experience. The auto gratuity is also annoying."
3 star rating,"Normally I love this place.  The aesthetics is very nice.  The food is good.  Majority of the staff are friendly.  But my last visit I encountered a very rude wait staff.  It was a very tall slim dark skin possibly gay man. I ordered a decent amount of food, but I must not have been eating fast enough for him, because he hovered over this counter that was directly behind me that sits up high (he was basically hovering over me) clicking his nails & his pen in my ears while I ate.  I looked behind me, looked him in the eyes & politely gave him the hint that it was annoying and hard to bare while I was eating.  He looked me dead in the eye, tapped even louder and said you ready for a box.  Mind you, I still had a full plate of food that I was eating.  Then he kept circling back (at least 4 times) asking me the same thing, ""ready for a box?"" & simultaneously going right back behind/over me clicking his nails and pen.  Idk, I just felt unwelcome & rushed."
4 star rating,"Came today for brunch around 12:30. It was fairly busy. My group of four all ordered mimosas for $12 each with every additional pour for $0.25. That's a steal I like! Note: you can only have five pours. I was going to order the plum + burrata but they were out of plums and were using nectarines as a substitute. So I ordered the ahi tuna instead. Yes, it was good. But $16 good? No. It was way too small and I was still hungry after I left. The vegetable poutine was really flavorful but also a small portion. My friend said the wings + waffle were great. And the central burger was huge and looked amazing. I should have gotten that. Why 3 stars? Small portions, slow service, and my waitress kind of had an attitude. I'd come back but maybe at an earlier time for faster service."
3 star rating,"Great food, great drinks, and great service. I can say no complaints besides they don't have a brunch menu Monday to Friday, which was a buzz kill, since my friend wanted eggs. However, the bottomless mimosas and fig flatbread were the bomb.com"
4 star rating,"Came here for brunch and food was decent (got the turkey omelette), got mimosas they weren't bottomless but got about 4 glasses which still did the job. Sat outside on the heated patio which was the best part and made up for the not so exceptional food. Extra star for ambience and great location. I'd still come again"
4 star rating,"We came here for brunch on Saturday. I ordered a drink, The Last Word. OMG the drink is hideous. My husband ordered the old-fashioned it was good. For brunch we ordered The chef special omelette which was tasteless. Frankly the best part of it was the two little pieces of toast. My husband said his avocado toast was good, not great, and my daughter and granddaughter both enjoyed the chocolate cherry crêpes they split. In general this is probably a fine restaurant, I got horrible food and a horrible drink but everyone else was relatively happy with their food. The reason I gave three stars out of five is the bad food and the fact the waiter never asked me how everything was. Because frankly I would have sent drink and the food back."
3 star rating,"I was wandering around downtown the other night just enjoying the vibe and snapping photos when I decided that I wanted a bite to eat. Where to go? Well, the first place I came upon was right here. I'd never been before, so I figured I'd check it out.I'm glad I did.I sat at the bar and ordered a cold beer and perused the menu. Lots of great sounding choices, but I spotted one of my favorites - shrimp and grits - so of course I had to order that. Omg. It was fantastic! Huge shrimp in a delicious, spicy sauce atop perfectly cooked grits. I'm still thinking about that meal, it was so good. The service was excellent, and the atmosphere is casual and laid back. You get all the stars, Central Kitchen. I can't wait to come back."
5 star rating,"This is a lovely place. I had a little brunch here with a friend and it was nice. I tried the salmon salad (I'm pretty sure it's not on the menu) and we had a bottle of champagne with a side of orange juice ;) Portions are good, my friend couldn't finish their plate. And the salad was tasty, and light. Service was okay, she seemed friendly enough. Wish we had sat on the patio but they were super busy so they didn't have space. Make sure you make a reservation! This place gets busy on the weekends for brunch."
5 star rating,The manager Christy treated us soooo well! She was such a sweet heart and when we had an issue she corrected it and just made my experience 10 times better. I got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken sandwich and it was so good! 10/10 You must come here!
3.5 star rating,"I had an excellent lunch and experience here today!First of all, staff/service was phenomenal.  We had Victoria for waitstaff but everyone we encountered was friendly.  I was surprised how laid back and comfortable the vibe was. Love!So check out my pic of the buttermilk fried chicken burger because that is AMAZING.  And I ordered the Brussels sprout salad which is FULL of the most wonderful chunks of thick bacon.On a beautiful day, sitting outside here cannot be beat."
5 star rating,I've come to this restaurant 3 times and it just gets better and better! The waiters are amazing and go the extra mile for guests. The food is top notch - almost cried eating the truffle fries. And the atmosphere is incredible. 10/10 recommend!!
5 star rating,"central has a great ambience and is located in the heart of detroit. parking can definitely be challenging but it is worth it. the staff are friendly and typical american dishes are tasty. they also have an incredible, inexpensive happy hour on weekdays that is a great deal!"
4 star rating,"Nice spot hip vibe. We had to wait a tad even with reservations. However the food (calamari, steak and fries with aus jus) were definitely worth the wait!Upcoming reservations!"
5 star rating,This place has a great atmosphere with outstanding food to match! Have been here a couple times and the service is always great. Drinks are exceptional as well. I suggest the Detroit burger but you can't go wrong with anything here.
5 star rating,Absolutely fantastic experience. Angie was wonderful and we felt taken care of the entire time we were here!!! Overall fantastic service and the perfect place for Sunday brunch and mimosas.
5 star rating,"Great after work Spot We stopped by here while walking one day and decided to grab something to eat. The ambiance was nice, didnt take us long to grab a seat had a nice relaxed feel to it, spacious and nice inside the drinks were really good"
5 star rating,"SUPERB!!! I love everything about this place, the service, the food and the drinks are all great! This was my second time coming and it was another great time. I love the cute little outside covered patio but please know that you can't do happy hour food on the outside patio only happy hours drinks(I think I got that right). This place offers a nice diverse crowd which is so nice to see in Detroit. The staff including the bus boys were super nice and friendly. I tried the Kentucky Mule cocktail...so tasty!! I also had the fries and parmesan wings, my friend had the calamari and all were very good and hot!Parking is a struggle but that is becoming the norm around downtown but that gives you more of an opportunity to walk around and check out other new spots in the area."
5 star rating,"I went here with my wife yesterday for a late dinner. I will preface this review by mentioning that there was some type of event at Campus Martius last night that may have affected service and how busy they were. The absolute first thing I noticed was how LOUD everything was - the music, the conversation, the ambient noise. I don't recall it being that loud the last time I was there. I did ask our server to see if they could turn the music down a smidge and I believe that he may have had some success, as things did improve throughout the course of our meal. I might request to be seated farther from the bar next time. Our server, Alejandro, was an absolute dear, joking around with us and telling us how much he liked what we ordered. We agreed with him that the creamy, brie-like cheese on their cheese plate was far and away the most delicious of the cheeses. (Other than that, I'd say that the cheese plate was just A-okay - the olives weren't very fresh and the manchego was bland). We thoroughly enjoyed our cocktails, the Last Word and Suburban Anxiety. Both were balanced and came out promptly. My wife had the Detroit burger, which she said was good (and filling). The chips it came with were under salted but had great texture. I had the plum and burrata salad and loved it - I don't think I've ever had plums and arugula together and I'm so glad I tried it! We also got the chocolate lava cake, Alejandro's favorite dessert, and it was fantastic. The vanilla gelato was especially good. (The whipped cream on the side was a bit bland and too heavy- it seemed as though they added a stabilizer of some kind). Another note: because I don't eat red meat and the menu is a little burger-heavy, I asked if an Impossible patty can be substituted (they do have an appetizer that uses an Impossible product). I guess there is not a way for them to do that right now. They do have a turkey burger and also a vegan taco option."
4 star rating,"I'm vegan, I used to go for their impossible lettuce wrap.  Was soooo good.  They took it off the menu, all they have is a bland no tasting cauliflower taco dish (2 come in the entire).  It's horrible.  I wouldn't go there if you are vegan or vegetarian except for fries, drink, and ambience.  You can tell no one their who cooks or is an owner or investor at that establishment is vegan.  All other dishes look delightful, like they put their foot in it (in a good way).  They just wanted to put something vegetarian on the menu to satisfy that eating preference.  Long winded, but all in all... the cauliflower taco's are trash.  Bill came to $30 for the taco dish and fries.  I'll go back if they bring back the impossible."
3.5 star rating,"Been here many times and I want to love this place.  It's disappointing.  I had the beef tips and calamari, both were overpowering with season to the point we could not eat it.  The tuna salad was just ok at best.  Great location but I won't be coming back."
2 star rating,Celebrated my birthday here this past weekend. I made reservations and they offered outdoor dining as you make your reservations. That was nice because we aren't excited about indoor dining just yet. AMEX called to inquire if they could group me and my friends reservations. They obliged. Another kudos!! Service was great! Our waiter gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne..... Kudos again!! Now to the food.... my tuna tartare was disgusting and the avocado toast was slimy.  But others had great dishes so I was able to find some good eats despite my bad choices. I heard the Buffalo omelet was delicious as were the fries. I'd definitely recommend it! Great times had by everyone!!
4 star rating,"First time going to brunch here this weekend! Loved their Mimosa deal... Got the house burger, the Mediterranean chicken wings (note: there's olives and feta) and the turkey burger! The ambience  was amazing and staff was so nice! I will definitely be returning as I had so much fun with my girls there!"
5 star rating,"Definitely a fan of the Central Kitchen. We went here very late on Saturday night. We were able to get a table quickly and we were both  happy that the kitchen was still open. I ordered the Central burger and it was very delicious. This entree also came with chips and a pickle. Service was polite and they were able to get the orders out in a timely manner. Prices were on high side, but when it's late and you want good food this is a good spot to try."
4 star rating,"Some of the worst service I have ever experienced when dining out. Came with a group of 4 for brunch and waited 20 minutes at a table to put in an order for food, barely saw our waiter after that and still ended up being charged incorrectly. FYI to everyone that gratuity is included regardless of your party size-- I'm assuming this explains the service being less than satisfactory. Food was decent but would probably only ever return for the $0.25 mimosa refills."
2 star rating,"I returned for lunch and tried more food this time. Everything was fresh and yummy. A few of us started with their onion soup which was hot, savory and delicious. We also tried the calamari, which sounds weird but is really good. Perfectly cooked, sweet and spicy.  Others ordered burgers and salads which they reported as being good. I had the fig flatbread which was very yummy. A crispy almost tortilla-like flatbread with a sweet balsamic figgy glaze, cheese and fried brussels sprouts leaves. Perfectly balanced.Quick service at lunch rush; we'll be back!"
4 star rating,"This is my 3rd time here, first time tasting the food. I had the veggie tacos which were very fresh and tasty, but needed salt and a bit of lime. The restaurant is beautiful, central to downtown, and has a great patio space. Love it. Old school Detroit photo murals on the walls, large wooden bar, gray, fancy lighting.Service is great and there is space at the bar for couples and singles on their lunch break. Small menu but interesting. Will return."
4 star rating,"Really cool place in downtown if you ever just want a burger and a good drink! Love the food and atmosphere, just a little loud inside since they have a dj on the weekend!"
4 star rating,First time here and have heard mixed reviews. Was invited for a work lunch and was very pleased. They don't take reservations which can be a problem but get there early and they accommodate. The service was great being we had a large group. Very attentive! I had buttermilk fried chicken and it was outstanding! Perfectly cooked and a great combination of dressing for the sandwich. The table got fries which are huge and the calamari was unique and flavorful. I say put it on your list.
5 star rating,Loved this place. Visited for brunch on Sunday afternoon. Mimosas were flowing with .25 refills. Ordered the burger and my dining mate and i shared the French toast. The burger was great but That French toast was unbelievable. Tasted like a churros with hazelnut sauce. Omg! Delish. I also tasted the pork belly hash. It just doesn't seem like you can go wrong. I can't wait to go back.
5 star rating,"Some friends and I went here right before a concert.  I really liked the decor, the atmosphere; had a really nice feel to it.  We ordered quite a few menu items here. The craft drinks were good and the food was decent.  The menu is pretty overpriced for what you get.  The wings aren't good; don't bother.  However, the salad with pomegranates in it was delicious; chicken very dry.  The service was excellent.  Would I make this place a stop that I had to frequent again and again.. probably not."
3.5 star rating,Used to think the burger was the best in the city but came in with a group and we all agreed they were just okay. The fries however are still delicious. I guess we have to blame COVID. It ruins everything!
4 star rating,"I'll be back! Had to wait a few minutes even with reservations but they were busy on a Sunday for brunch. We had mimosas, calamari, fries, chicken and waffles. Everything was GREAT. Good service, was a little slow but it was expected. Our drinks were always full so no complaints. Definitely understand why they're so busy!!"
5 star rating,Good food and atmosphere. It is nice that they have a small patio to use. Hand sanitizer and blankets at each table. I noticed blankets being changed between guests. My food was good and the mimosas were refillable!  Win win.
4 star rating,"My husband and I had a fantastic dinner experience here. He had the House Burger and I had the salmon. The salmon was in a green curry with a few noodles and nice veggies--especially the cool mushrooms. It had a bit of a kick, but the flavor was outstanding. Hubby said it was one of the best burgers he's had. Very gourmet. We also had a plate of wings that came out piping hot. They were fried perfectly, and we loved the taste.   Our side of fries seasoned with rosemary and thyme were tasty and crisp. Even though we arrived looking like bums because we were in the midst of moving, everyone who worked there was friendly toward us. Our waiter was a 10!  He knew the menu and helped us make our selections. He checked on us without being intrusive. The chef brought our food to the table.   She is to be commended. Everything was excellent. We were able to sit ""outside"" on the patio that had those zip up plastic sides.   Everyone working there had on face coverings, and they took our temperature when we entered."
5 star rating,I went to Detroit for a wedding and the next morning I came here to meet up with my friend from college. This place was highly recommended and the ambiance is great. The berry sangria was so good and the service was fast. I'll definitely be visiting The next time I'm in Michigan.
5 star rating,"I came here after work one evening, excited for happy hour.Parking: I get it, it's downtown detroit. But this wasn't great. It's a ~5 minute walk to the closest garage, and then that's at least 10$. So be prepared. If you work downtown and can walk/Uber, maybe do that. Pros:- Ambiance was chill and modern. Definitely modern and upscale. A good place for a work event or a dinner with friends. - Service: Even though it was busy, our server did a great job. She checked on us frequently. Food came in a timely fashion. We did get carded, which was a little weird at our age, but whatever.Food was solid. I got the buttermilk chicken sandwich, and we started with appetizers. Food was nothing to write home about, but definitely a safe choice and nothing was wrong with it. Happy hour appetizers are only at the bar or high top tables. But they only have 2-seater high tops. So basically if you're in a group, you can only get happy hour drinks. Happy hour list had some solid wines. Overall, good experience. I'll keep it on my list for the future."
4 star rating,"Great location, beautiful interior, and good food.Was our first time coming to Central Kitchen + Bar since it opened and was happy that when we got there, we were able to be seated outside even though we didn't have a reservation. It did take a while for someone to notice us, but once she did, it was fine. We never did get any water for the table, though despite asking several times for water.For drinks, I ordered a Refresher Course drink which was made of: Gypsy vodka, St. Germaine, Aperol and lemon. It was so refreshing and not too strong. I enjoyed it very much. For dinner, my friend and I split two entrees: The vegetarian tacos, which were delicious! Two tacos that were filled with blackened roasted cauliflower, avocado, sweet pepper cream, chayote slaw and cotija cheese. It came with chips and salsa verde. We also split the kale salad without prosciutto which had roasted red pepper, white beans, gruyere and a vinaigrette. Both dishes were really great and we were stuffed upon leaving.Overall, very cool space, but the food was good, drinks were good and the items weren't too expensive for what you got. I dock points for service, but at least we could sit outside and were seated immediately even though we didn't have a reservation which is recommended."
3 star rating,"My two biggest complaints: The noise level here is off the charts, it's so loud and in the summer they keep the windows open even if it's really hot out. There was no circulation at all when we went and almost difficult to breathe. Other than that, the atmosphere is really nice and the food was good.The Brussel sprout flatbread, calamari, fries, veggie tacos and fried ice cream were all my favorites of the night. I thought the Mediterranean flatbread, scallops, Parm wings, salmon and bacon Mac needed some help though. The flavor profiles of those dishes weren't well balanced in my opinion."
3 star rating,"If you're looking for a modern, instagramable and trendy place to try in Detroit, this is your place. It's great for brunch dates or a date night out. Came here with the girls for their Saturday morning mimosa special and had a great time! Usually this place is pretty busy and it can be difficult to grab a seat although it only took about five minutes for us this time. Hostess's and wait staff tend to be on the slower side here or at least every time I've came. It's not the place to grab a quick bite. But it's all on the inside anesthetically pleasing so it's all worth it for the ambiance.  We ordered the yogurt parfait, their brunch menu burger and order of fries. I would highly recommend getting their fries! Super yummy, has a little bit of spice to it that accented with their herbs. It comes with a garlic aioli and another sauce that has a peppery kick to it. Super yummy and enjoyable. Easily split between three people!I'm a big burger gal and this was delightful! It came with crispy fried pickles, thin sliced tomatoes, lettuce, American cheese, and bistro sauce on a fluffy brioche bun. I asked for a side of the garlic aioli to go with it, so good! It's officially in my top 20 favorite burgers. The yogurt parfait was a lot, it was a little too much. It came with a side of fruit that was fresh and sweet. But inside the yogurt had dried raisins, tangerines, mixed nuts that was primarily the inside of sunflower seeds and honey. I wish we could have customized it ourselves. No parking, you'll have to find a street spot or a garage nearby. Right by Cadillac square means this place is busy and around a high traffic area. I honestly have never minded that though, it's a nice chance to walk around downtown. The area it's in is safe and protected by security often. It's a place I'd go to once or twice but after that you've almost done it all."
3 star rating,"I'll never go back to this place. My friend and I went last night for a quick bite and some drinks. We ordered at about 8:45. We didn't want to hassle anyone so we waited to ask the status of our food. At 9:45, she told us that she FORGOT to put our food in. They didn't offer to take care of the bill. The manager never showed their face. The server then comes by and asks to give us a dessert or a drink. We choose the drink. We waited another 20 mins. She never came back. We asked about the drink and she said ""Unfortunately, my manger will only approve a free dessert"". So, I asked for the manager. The server then comes back with the drinks, on the house. I don't believe that the manager was ever told of the situation. What a shame!  I swear there are so many other places with great service downtown and this isn't one of them. Go elsewhere. The hostess was even standoffish. I don't like patronizing places like this! Never again. Don't go!"
3.5 star rating,"First time coming here was this evening. It was a Saturday evening Not super busy as a few big tables left as soon as we got there. The decor is very nice until you look up to the ceiling. Not Good At All, Huge holes all over the place and lots of white tape. Nor to the food and service. Service was mediocre at best. He may have came to the table 3 times. I ordered and finished my drink and had to wait for ever for another one. The Calamari was good, could have had less breading. The Parm wings left a bad aftertaste. As my dinner was the filet. I ordered it medium and you can see in the picture it was still attached to the cow."
2 star rating,"What A great little place in downtown Detroit. We headed out for a late lunch following an investment class we were assisting with.  We always ask for locals recommendations.It was located inside of the main level of a hotel, but actually had its own entrance. The staff came right over to greet us and answer the 500 questions we had about the menu. We started off with a drink and then place your orders. We all try to get different things so we can taste each other's meals!I ordered the avocado toast by recommendation of the server.  The serving was enormous!!!!!  It was lightly toasted bread with avocado on top. On top of that was some greenery, well a lot. To top all that off was a sunny side up egg, per my request. I ordered a side of potatoes to go with it. Avocados are new to my personal preferred list and I was super surprised at how well they put this together. The potatoes are also extremely yummy.Our experience was awesome. All the stuff is great. Multiple servers checked on us. Everything was clean.Con:  There was only one unisex bathroom at the entrance, however you could take the key card and go into the hotel walk around the hallway and use their restroom."
4 star rating,"What an amazing place to go to in downtown Detroit. I was in town, helping with the class, and our tradition is to let her hair down afterwards. One of our friends was a local and made several recommendations. We conferred with Yelp and all agree that this was a place to go. I opted for An avocado toast.   It was huge!! It was so tasty. Others in our group went for the traditional burger. This was a huge size as well. We then opted for the small potato thing as a side. It was equally amazing and tasty. The staff was very helpful and help explain the different menu items to us. Everything was clean and we were full when we left."
5 star rating,"I was impressed yesterday with their vegetarian selections! My girlfriend and I ordered the lettuce wraps and the Veggie Tacos. They were surprisingly delicious and had lots of flavor. Central is in a great location; right by Campus Martius, with ample parking during the weekdays.We will definitely be back again soon, thank you!"
5 star rating,Great drinks!! Calamari was excellent. Could use a bigger menu! Great service though. The set up and vibe are niceAs well!French fries dips were really good too!
4 star rating,"Chef Christina put her foot in this special dish!!! She prepared the best lobster grilled cheese that I have ever eaten. Fingers crossed that this dish becomes a signature staple at Central! There was just the right amount of butter gracing the grilled toast, a tasty blend of cheeses that didn't not drown out the chunks of lobster meat packed into this heaven sent sandwich. There was also a nice mixed green salad with in house made vinaigrette dressing paired with this lobster grilled cheese. Our Old Fashion cocktails were well blended and stiff - just like they should be."
5 star rating,"So this place wasn't bad, just not worth the cost. Ambiance--trendy but not too bougie. Surprisingly small location tho. Service was decent. The drinks were most definitely the best part --I'm not give a whiskey person but the Day for Remembrance was delicious and probably the best drink. Hot in the city was the jalapeño tequila drink and was quite spicy. Food was all just okay--calamari was pretty good but the entrees were just average, nothing to get too excited about. I had the trout, also tried the steak and salmon. Again all decent. Overall would come back for a few drinks and apps, but not necessarily for dinner. Also better for smaller groups."
3 star rating,Great spot for a weekend Brunch!  The restaurant is unique with an industrial flare.  The menu offers a variety of interesting options and my favorite part....the bottomless mimosas! The waitstaff are friendly and very accommodating to patrons.  We enjoyed our meals and plan to come back for the dinner menu.  Parking on Congress Garage can be validated for up to 2 Hours.
4 star rating,"Came here last night for a friend's work outing! Altogether, there were about 20 of us for dinner - a larger group for this restaurant definitely - and we sat in the ""outside"" covered patio area of the restaurant. Prior to this outing I have been to Central for just a night cap. First of all the place is beautiful - very pleasing in terms of everything from decor to vibe. Central is overall cozy without feeling stuffy or cramped.Service was excellent, our server(s) were accommodating and genuine. All of the staff we worked with were great with our larger group - and both drink and menu selections were described by our server with ease. I wish I could remember the names of the people that took care of us, but our ""main"" server was a younger gentleman with a great smile. The woman that was working with him for our party was also very personable, and just as friendly and accommodating. It kinda felt like we were the only people at the restaurant, despite the fact that the restaurant was definitely busy - which I just can't help but love. Food was great, cocktails were timely with an excellent pour - and seating for us was comfortable. I have to compliment the hostess as well! She greeted us with a genuine smile and was very attentive. I went to find the restroom at one point while I was here and without even having to ask, she immediately informed me that the room was occupied and directed me with a key to an alternative bathroom. She was warm and kind in her mannerisms and overall pleasant to speak with.Unfortunately, I have encountered hosts/hostesses (or even just staff in general) in establishments where you can practically ""feel"" how much they *don't* want to be there - for one reason or another. I am well aware of how difficult it can be to not only staff, but also retain employees in any dining establishment, and it's a great feeling as a patron to feel as though you are the priority as opposed to a burden, and to ""hear"" a smile in conversation. For me, it's the little things that make the experience, and your staff is excellent! Thank you for accommodating us so well! Would definitely recommend."
5 star rating,"I came here before and had a great experience so I brought my mother here for a lunch today. We waited 45 minutes for a salad and edamame. While waiting a couple asked to move to a bigger table near the window, and a waitress moved them to a two top and refused to let them sit in a bigger booth. This was off putting to witness because the venue was no where near capacity. The couple had an appetizer and two drinks and had to be moved 3 times due to the waitress. Finally when the cauliflower salad arrived it looked like this photo. It was supposed to come with cauliflower, green beans, pistachios, cherries and apples. It only came with cauliflower and green beans as evidenced in this photo. We asked the waitress to bring the correct toppings and she said she would and came back to fill up our water without the extra toppings. At this point we asked to speak to a manager and still waited 8 minutes for the manager to come over. Eventually she did and offered ""extra"" toppings and would come the meal. She returned with the toppings which still did not include the apple! It was unbelievable. This is a sad excuse for a salad. Service was awful and the food was not good. I won't be returning."
1 star rating,"A very nice space, in a great location.  Good place for date night.  Met up here after a conference, about 40 of us commandeered the patio area. Food selection was nice with vegetarian options.  Decent craft beer selections, Friendly wait staff and good service.  The food was terrific, I'll stop by next time I'm in town for sure."
3.5 star rating,"I really enjoy this place, though I believe some of  the waitresses could be more friendly and attentive. I have been two times since moving to Detroit, and both experiences have been similar. I love the decor and the fact that they have a patio. You can choose from a regular table or a couch situation, which looks perfect for happy hour. I sat on the patio, with a regulaf table, and enjoyed people watching. I also recieved my order pretty fast that day, and any waiter that walked by was willing to help. When I sat on the inside, my waitress didn't do much in my opinion and forgot my order + anything else I asked her for during dinner. I thank the sweet food runner because he noticed we were unattended and made sure we got whatever we needed from then on out. As far as the food, I'd give it a 8/10. They have great portions for the price and an easy-going menu with flexible options. I personally love the chicken sandwich, calamari and french fries. Please note that the basket of fries is HUGE! Share it and enjoy! I look forward to returning in the future for happy hour, as it runs pretty late."
4 star rating,"Came for brunch on a Saturday. They had a lot of enticing options but ended up getting the omelet of the day (Brussels sprouts, shredded pork, and Muenster cheese which I swapped for goat cheese)--delicious. It came with pan fried layonnaise potatoes which were also delicious and toast which was fine. I added a side of chicken sausage which came with two LARGE sausage links. if I had known I would have split it with someone--dedinitely recommend that over a side of bacon which apparently comes with 3 strips. Also got the mimosa ($12 plus 25cent refills). All in all a satisfying brunch."
4 star rating,I love this place Brunch was amazing today thanks to our waiter Marvin! Food was great and mimosas were even better! I like that they take your temperature upon entry. I'll be back!
5 star rating,"We ordered the seafood boil platter with shrimp, clams, mussels, crawfish, potatoes corn and andouille sausage. The sausage was most certainly NOT andouille, just tasted like a smokey bologna sausage. The portion was very small for the price charged, taste wise it was okay.As for ambiance, take a look at the ceiling. I am surprised we had nothing fall on our table. There are holes in the plaster, lamp shades slowly disintegrating and dusty. In the neighboring section, a couple had something that dropped on them from the ceiling. Overall, I did not feel comfortable and consider the place overpriced and not particularly clean."
2 star rating,Love love love the fries and the dipping sauce it comes with. Dessert was also good we got the pb Nutella and another Carmel dessert. Very satisfying. Entrees were alright nothing mind blowing. Our server was awesome
4 star rating,"We went to Central Kitchen + Bar over the weekend for our cheat meal after seeing pictures of their brunch on Yelp. I was gun-ho on getting their Chicken and Biscuits dish.First of all, CK+B was hard to find after parking in the 2 Detroit Parking Garage (160 E Congress Street, they validate!!) when using Google Maps. It's actually inside the large building on the corner - there is a store front on one side of the building...but not where we came in.My Chicken & Biscuits were delicious! I ate it without the jalapeno honey as I feared it would be too spicy and ruin my meal. The biscuits and chicken were a little tough to eat but it didn't affect the taste. Service was very nice and the food was delicious. I will be back to try something else on the menu."
5 star rating,"2 stars...Both for the Fig Flatbread. Absolutely awesome. Crispy, sweet, earthy, creamy, delicious AF. The Brussels are crispy, the fig jam sweet and deep with flavor and the goat cheese balances it just right. Ordered one to take home too. Missing 3 stars? Yeah...Sat at the bar. There were 3 bartenders. One tall guy who was trying his best to carry the weight. One shorter guy who looked like he had no idea where he was, and would frequently just zone out and have no motor function. He looked super confused most of the time. And then the service bartender, who was struggling to put together drink tickets in front of us between slamming shot after shot. Add in the hostess flirting with the guys next to us, and it was a terrific vibe. It was very odd having dirty plates in front of us, empty water glasses, watching the bartender an arms length away get drunk and try to make drinks. That take home flat bread? I watched it sit in the window for 6-7 minutes before I got up and asked the hostess for it so we could lead. Slim chance I ever recommend this place or go back. Good spot, hit or miss food, trashy staff. No bueno."
2 star rating,Busy but comfortable. Diverse crowd upscale urban feel that caters to professional.  Nice music selection it was not loud that you could not hold a good conversation. Definitely adding to my rotation
4 star rating,"Overcrowded and uncomfortable seating inside of the eatery. The hostess stand has a staff of incompetent workers. The food is greasy and overpriced for the portions. The outside seating is good but the people walking by add a horrible stench of Smelling like skunks and bad odors emit from them. Fake, white homeless guy works the patrons nearby and what ever happened to the Detroit police walking by or driving by. Food lacks any creativity and the salads are the worst portions.This place is busy and I truly believe this place will not last long."
2 star rating,"Came here on a Tuesday evening with some friends for a catch up dinner. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Menu was limited but did have a variety of appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches, flatbreads & entrees. We split the kalamari appetizer..I was told to order this dish by a friend. I was skeptical because of the sweet soy glaze, but I was definitely wrong. This was one of the best kalamari dishes I've ever had! My dinner was carne asada tacos with no slaw. They were DELICIOUS and the steak was so incredibly tender, juicy & well seasoned. Tacos were filled with radishes, jalapenos & cotija cheese. The tortillas were grilled & fluffy, and the tacos came with a HUGE side of tortilla chips (on the greasy side) and salsa verde. The salsa verde was okay, not too much tomatillo flavor, but it had a good balance of spice. I opted out of dessert this time but I want to come back to Central just to get some dessert - everything on their dessert menu sounded yummy! Including pumpkin mousse and a nutella brownie.My four star review is a result of the limited menu and not appealing to my tastes. Yes I am a picky eater but I would expect a few more basic dishes on this menu, and also a margherita flatbread."
3.5 star rating,I was not expecting to fall in love with this place. The chicken and waffles are  to die for the brioche French toast OMG the best ever!! Bacon eggs everything is outstanding.   The mimosa  are $12 but refills are 0.25 cant beat that. 100% one oF the best places in the D
5 star rating,"Third visit and worst. Quoted 20 min for table, waited 40. Food was cold, wrong and came out at separate times. No salt and pepper or butter on table for brunch items. With numerous places to go ... we won't come back here"
2 star rating,"There was no wait, and we were the first in line.  However, waited half hour?  Interesting.  However, the hostess was more than gracious.  So all good.The atmosphere was great (4 stars).  So far, a good night out with my wife.We ordered the fried cheese curds, carne tacos and the fried chicken sandwich.  The curds and tacos were fine (3 stars), but the fired chicken sandwich was overcooked (2 stars).  We also ordered 2 drinks a piece.Overall, was an ""OK"" experience.  If this were Chili's or Applebees, I would be satisfied.  However, for $85, I feel cheated.  I was so disappointed on cost, I didn't want to pay for the $15 Uber ride home.  There are too many other good restaurants in Detroit to go here."
3 star rating,"Entered into the restaurant with beautiful lighting and interesting decorations. The interior was definitely welcoming.For their food: I got their classic sautéed mushroom burger, and was throughly surprised!!!!Surprised because how extremely salty it was. No doubt, I was dried out by the saltiness and needed electrolytes back into my system. My friends did not enjoy their food, so maybe stay away from their mushroom burger."
3 star rating,"Hit or miss. Went for a group brunch and ordered a few different dishes. The Huevos rancheros deserve 1 star, the presentation was good but food didn't taste. Overly salty and none of liked it. On the upside the avocado toast was pretty good with a nice dressing on the arugula salad (4 stars). The drinks were mediocre, definitely had better in that area. Overall would not go back as better options are around."
3 star rating,"Central Kitchen is a perfect spot to meet after work. I'm giving it only 4 stars right now because I didn't actually eat anything, just had a few drinks. As per most happy hours they have drink and food specials, but I love the look and feel of the place. It's smaller than I expected, so I'm sure the wait time will be ridiculous on most non early days. The bartender was awesome though. Very personable and friendly.So for now it gets a good review on aesthetics and reasonably priced happy hour and a very cool bartender. Can't wait to try their menu."
4 star rating,"Went here for brunch one morning with a guest. Sadly it was winter so we couldn't get the full effect of their outdoor seating, however, it was still a great time! The inside decor is really interesting and different. A lot of leather and lights. We both got the French Toast and it was nothing like we have never experienced. Long and thick pieces of French Toast with some orange jam and Nutella spread. The toast was firm on the top with a soft center. It was very enjoyable. The location is prime too because it's right near Campus Martius Park. Will definitely keep this place high on our list."
5 star rating,"Amazing. Waitress was great. Bartender was great. I got chicken and waffles and mimosas. The chicken was so good!! It tastes like homemade fried chicken a grandma makes. The waffle was not that great to me, probably because of the jalapeño and the syrup. You can't beat the mimosas either. The lighting and music selection of the restaurant was chill. I would go here for brunch every weekend if I could."
5 star rating,"So I'll say up front. Food was fantastic, service was exceptional, and the seating was good we had a reservation. With that being said the reason for my 3 stars is there was some strange business practice we encountered. We had finished our food and waited for ever did not get the bill. Eventually a woman (I assume was the manager) was wondering when we were planning on leaving because the table was reserved at 1:00. Of course we hadn't got the bill yet so that would be on you guys. Then when we did get the bill it wasn't split up and no asked us previously. Once we finally got our own checks we noticed Central Kitchen already deducted their own tip from the bill. I'm not sure why that's the case it's extremely annoying. Have no clue why this place does that. It wasn't servers fault either because he appeared swamped with tables and was kept busy. Perhaps management should get a better handle on things."
3 star rating,"Went in for brunch.  Loved the open windows.  We had the potatoes. They came in a bowl with arugula, onions, and yellow peppers. Also had the chicken and waffles. It's was good. Chicken needed a little salt. The gravy was good but slightly cold."
3.5 star rating,"I've been to Central twice now, both with groups of at least 4 people. If you come with a group, expect at a least a little wait if its peak times like Friday or Saturday. Also, they won't take your name/seat you unless your full party is there.The decor of the place is really cool, and the food is tasty. The consistency between both experiences, and the reason it doesn't get 5 stars, is the mediocre service. This last time we went, we asked the waitress what the specials were and she said ""I'm not really sure, but I think we're out of it anyways."" When we asked what is was, she said ""some bacon appetizer, but they only made 5 tonight."" We thought this was pretty odd, including the whole interaction. It was made even stranger when we finished ordering and looked up at a chalkboard that described a rainbow trout special. Oh well. There were a few other issues including water getting refilled etc. I normally wouldn't fret but this place is on the pricier side.On to the food. The fig flatbread is fantastic. The ahi tuna salad is tasty and well dressed, although it could use a little more ahi tuna on it. The fish tacos were very good as well. Another member of our group ordered the shrimp and grits. While I didn't personally taste it, 2 people who did said it was a little on the oily and salty side. They also have a pretty solid beer/wine/cocktail list and we ordered a few beers.Overall, pretty tasty food at a trendy, well-decorated spot with some questionable service at times. We will be back, especially to try their happy hour which is supposed to be a good value."
4 star rating,"Very nice scenery with a dinner with friends, you can sit on the inside with nice lightening or on the outside to enjoy the view. I actually came here when there was a DJ playing so it was a nice touch of variety of music you can listen too. Staff was very nice and friendly, made sure we were alright and checked up on us. I believe the manager(guy in suit) even checked up on us to make sure we were fine. Food was great. I had the lamb rack, it was with a hint of pink just how I liked it. Now I got ratatouille on the side with it, me assuming it would look like pictures of google, but it was more soupy.. I'm not sure if it was suppose to be like it or if it was under cooked. I NEVER had it before lol The calamari was great. Looks like a small potion but the plate hole is about 6 inch wide so I got more than expected. The mandarins was a nice touch.Over all can't wait to come back!"
4 star rating,"The food is decent. To me, it's either over or under seasoned. Not worth the price. I would go here if I'm really craving something but other than that, I tried everything I wanted to try and it wasn't a wow factor for me. Again, not worth the price for me. I do recommend the Brussel sprouts flatbread though. That was the only thing I really enjoyed. Nothing bad to say about it. It was delicious."
3 star rating,"I like Central Kitchen for lunch. Their flatbread with fig is my favorite, and their burgers are pretty good. I like the design on the inside and the patio. The service is always good."
4 star rating,"Alright me just say the name threw me off a little - I was honestly expecting a more ""hole in the wall"" type of place but I was wrong.  To me it's more likely an upscale dining place and also where you can come in casual clothes and dine.Highly wouldn't recommend if you have kids and lot of people - they are pretty pricey.Food was good, drink were ok, and services was excellent.Happy eating!"
4 star rating,"Fig Flat Bread is off the chain. Calamari is super unique. Awesome experience. Waiter, Norris, is great!!!!"
5 star rating,"Parking: recommend taking an Uber. Street parking is difficultService: ExcellentAmbiance: Very very cute inside!! Great place to grab drinks or drinks/dinner. Food: I'm vegetarian, so we got the...Fig Flatbread: excellent if you had a sweet toothVegetarian tacos -- SOOogood!! very flavorful =)Vegetarian friendly"
4 star rating,"I didn't sit in and eat here, when I do, I'll update this review. I had takeout, a central burger and fries. They were both really good. I don't think you can really go wrong with a burger...I could be be wrong about that. Meanwhile, this burger was the jam. It was a bit on the expensive side, but very tasty. For the short time that I was inside this place, I noticed that it's very attractive, hip, and trendy. Probably a good spot to meet someone for drinks if you're downtown. The service was friendly, over the phone when I ordered and when I walked in to pick up my takeout."
4 star rating,"This place was suggested by a friend, went for dinner on a Monday night. I ordered the sea scallops with beet ravioli because it sounded interesting and delicious. I was shocked to see the small amount of food for $28. Presentation was great, and taste was good but nothing to overcome the fact I was given 3 ravioli and 3 scallops for that price. I have been to plenty of other nice restaurants and more trendy places and have been given more food than that for an entree. I was turned off by that entirely. I give it some stars because everyone else enjoyed their meals (burgers and tacos) and the beer/wine list was good. Just don't order an entree or ask serving size before you order."
2 star rating,"I've been to Central Kitchen twice now! Firstly, the location is fantastic. Right there across the street from Campus Martius. Service has always been great. The ambience of the restaurant is very nice as well! Both times I've ordered the Fig Pizza. Is so delicious. It's the perfect balance of something sweet, warm, crunchy. It's phenomenal and you need to try it!!! I've tried a few of their salads including the Ahi Tuna Salad. It was yummy but there was something off to me about it. I couldn't put my finger on it though"
3.5 star rating,So went for brunch this morning food was good but our server gave us one bill the charged us way more on the card n didn't leave the bill in check out folder I ask for a manager then she said you asked for separate checks I said no we didn't n no matter what he would hav left the check in there. I'm sure he made a mistake but made excuses then oweing up to it. Also she was unprofessional explaining to him in front of us what he should hav done n then made a joke well his new n that how you learn. Very unprofessional and all the years of being in business I was very disappointed
2 star rating,Indoor outdoor seating is nice as you can people watch/enjoy the weather in the warmer month in downtown Detroit.Menu options looked tasty (just went for drinks) and the cocktails/beer selection was .
5 star rating,Average. Had the special. Pulled pork sandwich with house made fries. Ice tea. Sandwich was average. Not bad. Not stellar. Chips definitely weren't the best I've had. Waiter was fantastic. Nice and knew the menu well. I wouldn't avoid this place..... but i wouldn't go out of my way either.
3 star rating,"Empty tables everywhere on a Saturday night with multiple tables around us waiting to pay their tabs. Word from the wait staff is that they are ""short staffed"" tonight. Our party of 7 had a 2 hour wait for a table. The food and drinks are phenomenal but the organization of this restaurant is sub par and disappointing for such a great location in Detroit..."
3 star rating,"Okay, cannot possibly say enough great things about this place. Incredible food and drinks, and perhaps the best happy hour in town! So yummy, and I am so partial to their fries. Great deals on drinks during their happy hour -- $5 mules? Amazing. -- and the staff could not be nicer and more accommodating. Love the atmosphere, the vibe, the food, the drinks and the people! A must try."
5 star rating,"Food and service is exceptional. Marvin takes customer service to another level. Dawn is always pleasant and accommodating. The bar staff always smile, even when stacked with customers during the holiday season"
5 star rating,"Just a quick stop for lunch today, I was very surprised at how good it was! Atmosphere is good, service was smooth and food was delicious! Had some catfish tacos that totally rocked! I'll be back for 2nds!"
5 star rating,"I don't think there was valet - or at least it wasn't very apparent - but a public lot just down the street (maybe a 60-second walk) made that annoyance nearly null. The atmosphere is amazing. Very light and airy. The seating options are plentiful (cozy two tops at the bar to large 6-people booths in the dining room). A TV in the bar with the red wings game on kept some members of our party happy. Didn't get a chance to dine in the heated patio area but it looked awesome, especially if you're sharing food with friends and don't necessarily need a formal table to sit. The calamari appetizer was recommended by our waiter Norris... And, boy, was he right! Different than normal calamari but incredible. Very lightly breaded. Not too heavy. We also got the BBQ wings and mussels to start. Both were gone quite quickly! Main courses were equally as well received (the Cuban, the burger, Ahi tuna salad, prosciutto flatbread)."
4 star rating,"We went at lunch, purposely at 11:30a to get in before the crowd.  We were a group of 15 (big group to accommodate at lunch, especially during their busy time) and we were treated as though we were the only people there  (huge props to our waitress Nicole).The choices were varied and all yummy.  I'd def recommend to anyone."
5 star rating,Casual  and chilled back atmosphere.The mussels - delicious. The extra spicy jalapeño drink was was exceptionally tasty .   Not too spicy - just right.
3.5 star rating,"What I liked:- modern, trendy interior. Feels casual/fancy all at the same time. It's a good mix. You don't need to be dressed up to eat here, but if you are you won't stick out either way. - service was good; we sat at the bar and the bartenders were quick to wait on us even though they were quite literally constantly making drinks. - location is tough to beat. Right in the heart of downtown in Campus Martius. You're within walking distance of basically anything. $10 parking right across the street. - food was tasty, came out pretty quickly...see below for more on that. - drinks were really good. I ordered an old fashioned and she nailed it. Perfect mix of everything. What I didn't like:- it had to be pushing 85 degrees in there. Apparently they don't have AC or something? It was a warm, extremely muggy night and after an hour of sitting in there I was dripping sweat from my forehead. For the love of god get some sort of AC or at the very least some fans to move the air around. It was so damn stuffy in there, definitely not the sort of thing to keep me sticking around. - the food, while tasty, is overpriced for what it is. $16 for a burger with some cheese and mushrooms on it? No fries either? Instead I got stale potato chips..my burger was awesome, just not $16 awesome. Wife had fish tacos. She said they were really good. Portion was just a little small. Overall: - Detroit Burger: $16- Fish Tacos: $16- Drink special of the day: $9- Old Fashioned: $12Total cost: $53 + tip Last word: cool restaurant right downtown in an awesome location. The prices aren't awful for a dinner for two right downtown, but the food wasn't anything special and didn't have me feeling like I couldn't wait to go back. Keep in mind we stayed on the cheap end of the menu. Once you get into entrees you're talking about $30-$50/plate, and I can't imagine it being worth it for that cost. Worth trying once or stopping in for a cocktail but I don't see myself going back a second time."
3 star rating,The Detroit Burger was excellent. Melted in my mouth...Best burger I ever had.. The waiter was very good and pretty funny too. Nice atmosphere and interesting architecture.
5 star rating,"First of all the location of this place is great, very easy to find right in downtown Detroit. Service was good, the people seemed pretty standoffish, but let me tell you the mimosas were right on the stop! A lot of champagne and just a dash of orange juice. The first one was $12, and refills .25 cents which is a very good deal considering by the 3-4 mimosa you're pretty tipsy and happy. The avocado toast was delicious, probably the best one I've had so far. The chorizo tacos were good but I think they'd taste better on corn tortillas instead of flour. The flour makes the dish feel very heavy. The chips were great. Overall this place feels very hipster and modern reminded me of Los Angeles restaurant. I loved it. Definitely a must visit if you're visiting Detroit and want some great brunch."
4 star rating,This review is specifically for their Happy Hour. I think its one of the best in Detroit especially on Thursdays - it's all night!!! It can get very crowded but i haven't had any issues finding a spot at the bar before. Definitely worth grabbing a cheaper drink at least before going to your next stop.
4 star rating,"Loved valet parking, thanks! Kinale & Nick.We were warmly greeted by 2 of the mostbeautifulest hostesses in hospitality business.William Shakespeare would agree with me.Rio and Brooke are not just about looks, they have patience needed for patrons musical chairs.They accommodated all of our very picky requests and they did so with a great! smile, not an attitude. Couldn't really enjoy outdoor seating, it was windyoutside so they had all their zippered panels closed.The service wasn't bad, not much wait for a waiter.The cocktails are great!, they're good and strong!and they exhibit the bartenders pride and craft, withthe lime wedges, Cheyanne pepper on the rim & not1 but 2 straws. Had 'Some Like it Hot' & ' Till All theMoney Runs Out'. The Central Chicken Wings wereinteresting,Truffled Parmesan & Blue Cheese chunks,they're plump, juicy and they came out piping HOT!!!Very big (3) and tasty Scallops, the Catfish Tacos weregood, tasty fish with very fresh veggies. Great! Draftbeers, 'Soft Parade Shandy (fruity),Old Nation M-43(IPA) and the Right Brain Hawk Owl (amber ale).Don't tell, but we left the restaurant, walked over to the Caribbean BeachParty, to Townhouse, Hard Rock, Calexico and then backto Central Kitchen for dessert. Brooke recommended we try their Central Fried Ice Cream and their Peanut Butter SemiFreddo both were great! selections, thanks! Brooke. The bartender also made us a special hot liquor ice cream drink that was divine! Thanks to our waiters Joel, Marvin, our busboy Andrew, the Friday DJ / Mixologist and our mysterious bartender young lady who we will have tomeet during a future visit."
5 star rating,"Lively environment, spectacular food! I enjoyed the calamari which has a unique blend of flavors and textures. The rainbow trout was just wonderful as well. My husband's shrimp and grits were great but I liked my rainbow trout even more! We went on a Friday night and since they don't take reservations for large parties we called an hour ahead and they did their very best to accommodate us so we only had a short wait once everyone in our party arrived. Service was pretty good and the server did her job but wasn't super friendly, particularly engaging or anything. Would definitely return for the food and environment. Detroit is on the come up!"
4 star rating,"We went here for a friend's birthday party so there were seven in our group.  We were seated in a booth area right near a large open window.  The atmosphere is really cute and trendy with an easy, breezy feel.  It feels contemporary and modern.  The venue itself is not very large so it creates somewhat of an intimate feel.  They also have an area outside where you can sit if the weather is nice.  We went on a Saturday night and two people in our party were already seated when we arrived so we walked right over to our table.  Our waitress came up right away and took our drink orders.  Since we were waiting on the rest of our party to arrive, we took our time in canvassing the menu.  The menu is not huge but there is enough variety where everyone should pretty much be able to find something they like.  We decided to order some appetizers while we waited for the rest of our party.  We chose the chicken wings and fried cheese curds.  They put all the sauces on the side which was nice since we were sharing amongst such a large group.  The wings were good but oh my goodness, the cheese curds were amazing!  They came with a buffalo ranch sauce which was also out of this world.  The flavor of the cheese curds were bold but not overwhelming.  They were just so addictive!  For my entree, I decided to go with the Bistro salad which contained mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, and french green beans, and fried buttermilk shallots.  I opted out of the dressing the salad came with and elected the pickled ginger dressing and white balsamic dressings on the side instead.  And when I tell you the white balsamic dressing was probably one of the best that I've ever had, I am telling you the honest truth!  It was out of this world.  If you go, you have to try it!  I also decided to add grilled chicken breast to my salad for protein.  I'm deducting a star because the waitress forgot to put in my chicken and brought out my salad last and without the chicken while everyone ate their food.  So, I sat there for about an extra 15-20 minutes waiting for my chicken breast to eat my salad.  She didn't apologize or anything.  I thought that was a little rude.  Once the chicken finally came out, it was hot and fresh and tasty so I was pleased with my food overall.  The other people in my party had the burger, turkey burger, and cuban burger.  They all enjoyed their food.  I tasted a few of my friend's fries as well.  They were also good.  I honestly don't have any complaints about the food.  It was great!I'll be back and may elect to sit outside this time.  One of the owners also came up to our table afterward and insisted that we try the Nutella ice cream.  So, I'll add that to my list of things to try next."
4 star rating,"Stopped in for brunch on a Sunday morning.  Ended up with a pork belly hash that was AMAZING!!!!!  The flavors were incredible, and hit the spot. I've never been disappointed with a meal or a drink here."
5 star rating,"I absolutely loved this place. Aside from one complaint it was great.I started the meal with the onion soup. In my top 10 of best French Onion soups I've had. Not salty very nice taste.Had the Detroit burger as my main entree. Pretty darn good. Great combination of flavors and the zip sauce was excellent.My only complaint is the noise level. I thought the music was too loud and it was hard to have a conversation with my wife who was sitting across from me.Service was excellent, no complaints there either.Other than that great food. We will be back!"
4 star rating,"The Buttermilk chicken sandwich was not flavorful. They cover it in ranch to hide that it was not seasoned. The tomato was shriveled not fresh at all. The fish tacos had burnt tortillas. And dry cole slaw. The chef was nice enough to cook mussels that are only on the dinner menu however the waitress made it seem like a very big deal. If that was the case, she should have just said that it wasn't available at lunch. The bread that comes with the mussels were super burnt. (See photo of bread and tortilla) the crawfish sandwich is probably the only good thing on the menu. The ice tea also has no flavor. Tasted like straight lemons. This place is subpar"
3.5 star rating,"Food is generally good, service has been awful in both times I've been there. Calamari and Mac and cheese were very good. Server brought drinks and didn't come back until about 10 minutes after we got our food."
3 star rating,"We made our second trip here on Labor Day aka in the middle of the Jazz festival...needless to say it was super busy but the food was delish and customer service was on point. My husband had the Detroit burger that he devoured with a side of shoestring fries. I had the vegetarian tacos, that were flavorful and filling. We had to take our fig flatbread appetizer home to enjoy due to a little snafu with that. Our server boxed it up to snack on later , he and manager apologized for the mix up and made it right.The menu is on the smaller side but everything we've tried has been wonderful. Very fresh salads both in the concepts and ingredients used. All the dishes that came by us looked appetizing. Bottom line food is fresh, unique and delicious. We came at a crazy busy time, was everything executed perectly...no but they made it right without us evening asking. Honestly what more can you ask for? We'll see you again soon Central Kitchen."
4 star rating,This place is so interesting and fun! Also a great location next to Campus Martius especially during the holidays.Visited with my boyfriend on a Thursday night and didn't have to wait for a table. We were originally sat by the windows next to a keyboard performer so we asked to move and they gladly showed us to a new table.The service was excellent and the food was delicious! The side of Mac n Cheese was so scrumptious and filling considering it was a side and the french fries were also very tasty.
4 star rating,Central is a great place for a wine night and enjoy one of their salads and the fig flat bread! I like it their brunch options just as much too! Sometimes seating can be an issue if you come in with a group but I've been able to get in after waiting just a bit!
4 star rating,"This one star is for poor service and questionable front of house practices. I came with a group of 4. 2 people arrived first and were told they could not be seated until the entire party arrived. However we noticed that these same rules did not apply to  a group of five that arrived after us, which had only 3 members present. We questioned the host about this who gave us some poor excuse. We are black and the other group (who was seated) was not. Just sayin.........We left to find a restaurant where we felt more welcome. Needless to say I will not be back to central kitchen. So unfortunate...."
1 star rating,"Hostess and waitress were very friendly. Wait time was less then expected, always a plus. Only one restroom, that was strange. Waitress was knowledgeable of the food, which means she herself eats there, also a plus. She recommended the chicken sandwich and braised short ribs. I myself had the short ribs, it was better then average. A little bland to my liking, but descent. The real winner was the buttermilk chicken sandwich, Mac and cheese and fries. All very delicious. Will visit again and order the chicken sandwich!!"
4 star rating,"Stoped into this restaurant after the Rhonda Walker 5K with the family. They have a very nice atmosphere the windows were open and it has a very open air feel inside, the weather was very nice it was warm enough to eat outside. They did not have high chairs to accommodate little ones or the booster seats however I understand this is a downtown bar so next time I'll  call ahead. The host was very accommodating and sat us in a booth right next to the window open to the outside. I ordered the tropic thunder which had Gin in it. It has pineapple as well, it's not very tropical however it is refreshing. We ordered the Belgian waffle and the Vegetable Strata. The berry compote was a nice compliment and went well with the waffle. The waffle was great. The vegetable strata is like a warm baked casserole with caramelized onions mushrooms and other veggies in a bowl, it  comes with a salad. There are many more items on their menu and I'd like to come back definitely a must-try."
3 star rating,"At my ""Reminisce spot"" The atmosphere always brings me back. Absorbing a little alternative and an El Chapo. Winding down with a plate of Tender Wings; celery crisp and a selection of sauces. The crowd is pouring in.....trendy ambiance. Enjoyable for after work."
5 star rating,"The vegetarian tacos were spectacular!! Sarah our waitress was nice, and the location is a fun section of Detroit to walk around."
5 star rating,"Came here for brunch for the 2nd time and ordered their special waffle for the day and it was delicious. It had a caramel drizzle and fresh apples on top, so freaking good. Perfect Sunday brunch spot."
3.5 star rating,"I love Central Kitchen! Every time I come here, I receive great service, delicious food, and a positive atmosphere. They're great for brunch, w/a chef's new signature omelette every Sunday, and 25¢ refills on mimosas. All day happy hour currently on Thursday, and central location near Campus Martius! Also love running into cool people whenever I come here! A must go!"
5 star rating,"It seems as if dining at one of the new, hipster restaurants and or 'bistros' that have saturated the city doesn't seem to come with good service. After trying several spots to get a meal and a few drinks with minimal wait, we walked in to Central Kitchen and Bar to be seated immediately. Great........................We waited half of one hour before we were noticed by any one of the waitstaff. I had to go to the bar to politely ask the bartender if she could see to it that whomever was in charge of waiting tables in our area to please come and pay us a visit. This was after 30 minutes of waiting. After about another 10 minutes and some more confusion, our waitress, who more than likely took several Xanax pills before her shift,brings two waters to the table with 4 people seated at it. Moron. She arrived with two other waters, took our drink order, came back about 25 minutes later with an order that wasn't ours,SURPRISE! However, promptly (10 minutes) came back with our correct order and believe it or not, one free bottle of Miller Lite. Seriously? Suck it. It was at that moment, we decided we would leave after our Pei Mussels and Cheese curds had ben delivered and consumed. Credit to the chef, he probably doesn't ride a mountain bike to work. 4 people 4 cocktails 4 beers , two apps, $84 F U C K I N G Dollars. The boys  were just drinking some budwieser's and the female guests had the reasonably priced 9 dollar moscow mule. SO, sorry to be long winded, but this place should give me a refund just for pissing me the f u c k off. We were there for 3 hours, the place has one bathroom, and the interior decorator was hired from craigslist."
2 star rating,"This place has a great atmosphere and the lounge area outside it perfect for a small group or casual date. I've been wanting to come here for a long time and was surprisingly not impressed with the menu. My friends order food, which all looked appealing, but nothing jumped out at me. The waitress was incredibly nice and helped me order a drink to my liking. Overall, this place was okay and I'll come back."
3 star rating,"The interior decorating is great, as well as tHe ambiance. It's got this modern, industrial feel to is. However, pretty much after that, nOt great.  Myself and two others were sitting at the bar, having a glass of wine, waiting for our table.  I'm sitting pretty close to a pole/extension and an employee kind of hurriedly asks to get by, making me move just so she could talk to a coworker.  When my text message showed up saying our table was ready, I immediately went up to thhe host stand. Myself and a friend asked the host to ask our server to give one of us the bill. As we were seated, we waited a decent amount of time before someone came over. There was a lot of confusion as to who was actually waiting on us. Then, clearly, the host did not relay our request as the server happily accepted our other friend's credit card. We ordered three entrees and an appetizer, they came out at the same time. The food was pretty good, a bit over priced for the portions. I'd like to go back during the summer but besides that there are other places I want to check out."
3 star rating,"Great food & great service!Love bringing my out of town clients here, food is not that great but the atmosphere is off the charts the service is much better than the food! I previously left a rude comment about the fish I think I was just having a bad day, I recently visited & noticed that the chef mixed crispy fish with soup it was actually really good! My take away is ""Just because I'm having a bad I day I do not need to be so quick to post a review or be so critical"" I love the location and the ambiance and my clients love the cocktails and DJ, service is off the charts!! Location location location!! Great location."
5 star rating,We chose here hoping to have outdoor seating but they were having a private party outside. We really enjoyed all the repurposed furniture and lighting. We had the Ceviche which came in an unexpected tomato sauce but was tasty.  The Sea Scallops were cooked perfectly. But the best part of the meal was the Fried Ice Cream. We will be back to try the Flatbread that everyone talks about.
4 star rating,"I thought this was an excellent place to go. I met a friend downtown and we walked here and were immediately seated. It was a Tuesday night and it was full of people. We ordered the flatbread that had Brussel sprouts. I don't like brussel sprouts so I didn't eat it but will say that everyone else liked it. I ordered the cauliflower salad with salmon for my main course and that was excellent. I really enjoyed the flavors that were coming out of all of the items in the salad. You could taste every flavor. The salmon was cooked very well also. I would say that you should order meat to go along with this salad since it is on the smaller side. For desert I ordered the fried ice cream. The ice cream was not fried but was with tortillas chips underneath it. Not sure I would get this desert again. I thought it needed a little more flavor. Since ice cream is good, we all enjoyed it. I will definitely come back here again. I thought it was a great experience and would like to try more on the menu."
4 star rating,"My parents are visiting from out of town so I brought them here on Monday night. We had a fantastic experience! We showed up in time to take advantage of some of their great happy hour specials, I enjoyed a $5 Moscow Mule while my dad chose a $6 Bullet Old Fashioned (I'm not a bourbon gal but he was very excited to see such an inexpensive Bullet drink so that was a win!)Our waiter, Alejandro was so friendly and accommodating to all of our requests. My mom is an extremely picky eater, but he happily answered all of her questions and was happy to adjust her dish as she asked. Our food was excellent. My mom and I both had the Bistro Salad which was a great portion and full of fresh and tasty ingredients. My dad went with the Central Burger which he said was perfectly cooked and tasted great. The only element of the meal that was not outstanding was the edamame appetizer. Let me preface this by saying that I am a salt FIEND. I salt almost every piece of food I put in my mouth. That said, this edamame was so salty that anyone who does not share the same affinity for sodium that I do would almost certainly find it inedible. Regardless, that was a small blemish on an otherwise great experience. This is a great place to come with friends or family for a trendy and delicious dining experience."
4 star rating,The wings are excellent. Great wine and atmosphere. Did not have dinner. I will come back.
5 star rating,"Warning: They do NOT do separate checks for parties greater than 6 people. Wish we had been told beforehand...Ambiance: Bright and clean, kind of a modern hotel meets industrial vibe. The place was fairly packed before we arrived and it was still a long wait for our party since they don't take reservations. Once we were seated the service was actually pretty decent with our drink orders being filled in a reasonable amount of time, our glasses/dishes cleared regularly, and our staff being generally friendly minus the lack of the warning above about separate checks. The acoustics were also nice and it never seemed to noisy despite being full and the music wasn't overwhelming either. Also be warned they only have one unisex bathroom otherwise you have to request a keycard to the use the bathroom in the building's lobby.Food: For appetizers, we shared the calamari, fried cheese curds, and pulled pork nachos. The nachos were served cold which our server caught and comp'd us for but even still they were mediocre and had a sweet chile bbq sauce which was not what we were expected. Continuing the trend of being unexpected, the calamari was served with snap peas and mandarin oranges in a semi-sweet spicy asian sauce. The dish itself was well-composed for it was going for, the calamari itself was tender albeit a little soggy and be warned it had a strong seafood odor which can be off-putting to some. The cheesecurds were perhaps the best app being light, crispy, and of course cheesey although half of our curds were fried into two large clumps which was annoying. They're also not the squeaky chewy curds some wisconsinites may be looking for but had more of a mozarella stick texture. The buffalo sauce served with it was also OK but not inspired by any means. The only part of the meal I found flawless was the Detroit burger which was excuted extremely well. The brioche bun was tender and not too thick/overwhelming, the veggies well-portioned, the zip sauce added a nice hint of tang. The patty was still pink  but closer to rare when I asked for medium rare (but that's OK with me). The best part of the burger was the roasted mushroom and deglazed sauce which added a huge boost of savoriness to the dish and made it unique from most other burgers. It's just a shame it costs $13 and only comes with a pickle. I will say our drinks were also well-mixed, striking a good balance between not too strong and not too weak.Overall I was unimpressed with our meal. The server was super nice and did her best but the reservation and check policies don't make it easy to host a large party. The appetizers were all odd with unnecessary culinary twists and small things such as avoiding clumping of your fried curds or heating up the pulled pork of your nachos gets overlooked. The Detroit burger was admittedly quite delicious but horrendously over-priced. All-in-all I will probably not come back here considering the other options available."
3.5 star rating,"The service was not bad, the environment was great although the patio had a bit of a cold breeze coming underneath. Overall, not a very well thought out service and there was much to improve on. Wouldn't recommend. . .The main issue was the food, while you can't mess up a bottle of Vueve without a significant amount of effort they were able to completely screw a steak salad. The salad was okay, lettuce a bit cheap. The steak, however, was ordered medium and arrived as dog-food. It was completely dry, horribly over cooked. When we asked for more, they removed the dish and returned 10 minutes later with a new steak on a side plate. It took them a few more minutes to bring the salad that it should have come on..."
1 star rating,Lovely place to sit outside and watch the world go by. We enjoyed some appetizers and a bottle of Cava on a beautiful day in Detroit. The service was attentive and the bartender made a wonderful drink that wasn't on the menu - obviously focusing on customer satisfaction!One nice think was when they served us a glass of water they THANKFULLY did not serve straws!  Nice to see Detroit establishments taking a lead on environmental concerns.
4 star rating,The only bad thing about this place was that you can't make reservations and you can't call ahead to be put on the list. there's really no place to comfortably wait. The food was delicious and the prices were great. Carnitas Nachos were amazing and the chickpea veggie burger was so flavorful. Everything we ate tasted super fresh and they use local vendors in Detroit. It's an industrial chill atmosphere. Would definitely go back.
4 star rating,"One of my go-to lunch spots downtown.  I would say it's hard to choose between Central Kitchen and Townhouse for lunch, but the tiebreaker is the slightly better prices here.  Both are great!At Central Kitchen I've had the Central Burger and the Detroit Burger.  The former is a good standard option and comes with bacon, which is great, but the latter is my favorite, with mushrooms and gruyere.  And I'm not sure if it's the zip or the bistro sauce or what, but there is something extra about it that is unctuous and instantly crave-enducing.  I've also had the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and the Cuban, and both are AWESOME.  Especially if you're really craving a good Cuban, I would recommend this over the one at the Dime Store a million times over.They also have good beer, and it's a very cool location and right next to the Roasting Plant, where you can get the large coffee drink that will be key to staying awake for the second half of your work day."
4 star rating,"Great food and hip atmosphere.I enjoyed the food thoroughly and I am looking forward to the next time I dine here.  It was a Friday night and it was busy, but there wasn't a wait for a two-top. It is pretty congested inside with the restaurant space not being very large.For two people are bill was around $60 which wasn't bad. We each ordered a cocktail ($12 a piece) and I thought they were both excellent.  They are on the stronger side, so I'm not complaining :) I thought the drink with Maker's Mark and St Germain was fabulous!We started with the Wisconsin cheese curds, recommended to me by a friend. They were good, but I would probably pass on them next time. I ordered the Veggie tacos for my entree and OMG these were the best I've had. The tortillas were flour over corn which I prefer and they weren't soggy. The roasted cauliflower was to die for and the slaw added great taste.My disappointment was with the service.  We were never checked on after our food came. Someone who wasn't our server noticed I needed a box and grabbed one and then after waiting 15 minutes with no drinks or plates someone finally came around, once again not our server, to see if we were ready for the bill. This may have been a one-time thing and something happened, but I've also heard from others that their service was nothing to rave about."
4 star rating,"So ima come clean, i'm leaving this review is left after leaving a horrible establishment that didn't say a word to us. I been here twice, first time with my work team at Amrock. Second time with my cousin and sister and both times great. Specifically the second time, we walk in and our reservation at 2:30 and it's 2:15, and they sit us no problem. Our waiter come maybe 5 minutes maybe just a bit longer but on top of everything. Shout out Alejandro. He take our entire order, mimosas here asap, food here in under 10 minutes. He forgot water but apologized and brought it no problem, so we were gravy. Refills on point, he asked all questions, everything. Shout out Alejandro. Forgot to mention the temperature checks and everything too. 12 dollar mimosas with 25 cent refills. I highly recommend. Come here. Chicken and waffles fire. Brioche Toast fire. Everything you need, good food, good service. everything."
5 star rating,This place should have 5 stars. The interior is so cute it includes an outside patio but it's heated so it's actually enjoyable. The Bloody Mary's are to die for and so is the burger. I highly recommend this place for people that enjoy a comfortable couch setting instead of chairs and for mimosas
5 star rating,"Nice ambiance, thought we would grab a drink after the Jazz Festival. Were halted at the door to get wristband to prove we were of drinking age (tacky). When I went to the restroom, was ushered into hallway restroom by a rude hostess, only to be locked out of the restaurant and have to get past wristband man again. Red headed tattooed bartender was rude and bitchy. Blonde bartender stood back there like a deer in headlights instead of helping. Calamari was saving grace-fun Asian twist on it. Go for 5 stars DAJr!!!!"
3 star rating,"Hopefully tonight was a fluke. It was my third time, the first two times were week nights with coworkers and it was great. Since they didn't take reservations we did call ahead seating an hour in advance and then waited nearly an hour and a half after we arrived before we were seated. While we were waiting we had a drink at the bar and I went to the bathroom, it was trashed and there was no toilet paper or paper towel. Once seated we ordered food. The chicken wings appetizer was pretty bland. When the main came, wow, what a disappointment. I ordered a burger and fries and my wife orderd the steak tacos; they where way over salted, had we not waited over two hours I would have sent it back. The chips with the tacos where so salty we did not eat them. On top of this they forgot to bring the fries I ordered.I work downtown and have been to pretty much every restaurant with coworkers or clients, with the amount of great restaurants that have opened up in recent years Central Kitchen is a waste of your time."
1 star rating,"I've been here a few times and have mostly had really good experiences. There is a small sort of outdoor patio (it's covered) and the atmosphere inside is city-chic and fairly loud. The food is fabulous and they take allergies and food sensitivities seriously. My favorite thing on the menu is the fig flatbread! It's a flatbread with super crispy Brussels sprouts, goat cheese, fig jam, and a balsamic reduction. I gave Central Kitchen four stars because service always starts off great and then midway through the meal, every time, we've had to track down the water for more drinks, more water, and the bill."
3.5 star rating,Horrible service Over pricedWaitress was not accommodating There wasn't enough options on the menuDrinks were $10 each and very weak
1 star rating,"One of the main things I look for in a restaurant is a good atmosphere. Central Kitchen + Bar definitely has that! Every time I've gone, the place is pretty full - which I like, because who wants to go sit at a completely empty restaurant? The place is big enough that I've never had to wait too long, but on a Friday/Saturday night the place does get really busy so be prepared. The location also can't be beat, as it's right next to Campus Martius. Decor/music really add to the fun and social atmosphere here.As for the food, I've enjoyed all my meals. The menu is a lot like many New American restaurants. Not too lengthy, but a cool twist on some staple items. Try the veggie tacos (even if you're not vegetarian) - so good!"
5 star rating,"This was an amazing place for lunch! The atmosphere is very inviting, warm, and modern. The workers were very sweet and polite. I ordered the fish tacos which were delicious! The tacos were fresh the cole slaw was really good, you could really taste each flavor from the different ingredients. They came with a side of chips. I would definitely recommend it! Hopefully I'll be back to visit again"
5 star rating,"Happy hour is ok , not a huge selection. The bar itself has a cute setup , and it's right in the heart of downtown Detroit. Bartender was ok. He didn't try to up sell anything to me, he wanted to serve me so he could back to his phone. Oh well lol. I guess I will just talk to myself lol"
3 star rating,"I consider myself pretty well versed in Detroit Restaurants but when I heard Marcus Samuelsson was taking over Central Kitchen; I thought ""huh? where is that"".Hidden gem tucked around a corner from Campus Martius. The decor is super chic, inviting and I instantly felt like I was like a restaurant in NYC or LA. The food was great- fig flatbread and some of Marcus' creations from his new cookbook and the staff was amazing.Best thing about this place. The prices!!! You can have a great meal, in great scenery and it wont cost you an arm and a leg. :: ahem, Selden:: Good Job Central; I will be back soon! xx"
5 star rating,Cool industrial chic interior with a great menu and attentive wait staff.  We had a party of 14 and had a great time.
4 star rating,"Hello, I just wanted to express why I will not be dining with you guys anytime in the near future or possibly ever again. This was my second time in Central and I know and understand why my coworkers in the first national building are not too fond of the place. The bar service was not good at all. I'm a pretty reasonable person since I have too worked as a bar waitress in my younger days, so I know how it can be but I also know and understand how a customer should be treated. After, it was made clear that I was disturbing the female bartender from counting money/drawer I waited patiently for assistance. Even after she finished with the money she continued to chat a bit with a coworker. Ok, fine as well, it could have been important. Then, once she decided to come over she took my drink order, provided drink and left to sit down with friends and eat. I was pretty hungry myself so I could relate. I stopped a waitress in passing and asked ""is food served at the bar?"" she said ""yes"" and grabbed the bartender away from other workers who were probably on a break. I placed a food order but then cancelled and paid for a barely touched drink because clearly I was not wanted there and decided to go eat across the street at the Bistro before my party joined me. I take it as if you don't want me to spend money there then why should I?"
2 star rating,"We (My Husband and I) went for Sunday Brunch and we where seated in there enclosed patio area, which was kind of nice, being able to see the skating rink and all. There brunch menu was small but the food was exceptional, I had the pork belly hash and my husband had the chorizo tacos and an order of fries. For drinks i had the mimosa which is $12 but each additional mimosa is only a quarter more and I also had a peach Bellini and my husband had their Derby cocktail. All in all a great place to get away from the kids and enjoy spousal company over brunch and drinks....can't wait to go back for dinner."
5 star rating,Great food! Went for brunch. Beautiful atmosphere.Downside - 1 unisex bathroom for the place
5 star rating,"I really enjoyed the brunch I had here this weekend! My husband and I had the omelette and the cauliflower salad and everything was delicious. During brunch, they have a mimosa deal which was reasonably priced. I also one of their craft cocktails which was really yummy. I liked that their brunch lasts until 3pm, so if you're getting a slow start to the day, this is perfect for you."
3.5 star rating,"You can not make a reservation but you can call ahead and let them know you're coming. All of the appetizers are great. The cheese curds and calamari are amazing, I also recommend the flat bread! The hostess' we're not very helpful, and never gave us a time of seating or where we were in line. We had to remind them where we were and asked when we could sit."
5 star rating,"We came here for my buddy's birthday, without a reservation mind you. It was a 95 degree day and we wanted someplace with A/C, and also someplace we hadn't been before. We had a party of 7 and initially the maître d' asked the manager, Nadia, where she wanted us sat. First he was told to sit us on the outside patio...on a loveseat with a couple pairs of adjacent chairs...in the 95 degree heat? So I can sweat while I eat out of my lap? Great idea...No thanks!When we said that wouldn't work he asked the manager again if he could seat us at one of the 8 person booths towards the back of the restaurant. With a very snarky attitude she said we'd have to be gone by 8 because a party had reserved all 4 of the booths. It was like 4 pm...stow the attitude, please! Once that unpleasantness was over and we were sat, we were greeted by Sarah....ask for her! She's one of the nicest and funniest servers I've ever had. She was fantastic!She recommended a few cocktails and mentioned some of the patron's favorites off the food menu. I tried a Rocking Chair cocktail...it was good but not my speed. My girl had a glass of bubbly that was unfortunately flat. Sarah took it back and got her a fresh glass of something different. For the food we started with the calamari. It was outstanding! Sweet and tart with an Asian flair. It might not be for everyone but we really liked it. We also had a couple sandwiches to split. I ordered the Buttermilk Chicken sandwich and my girl ordered their Cuban. The chicken sandwich was OK. The Cuban though...it was the best I've had to date and since it's my favorite sandwich I've eaten quite a few by now. It was juicy and piled high with a nice press on the bread and really satisfying. All in all we had a nice experience here. The management seems a little uptight but maybe it was an off day. We liked the décor and the wall size photograph of Detroit was a conversation piece throughout the meal. I think this place is a winner....definitely worth a try."
4 star rating,"We wandered in here because it looked inviting and the people we could see inside seemed cheerful. Not surprising, the food and vibe were pretty good. When I'm in totally unfamiliar places I often order from other people's tables and this was no exception: the fried cheese curds went by and I beckoned them to join us. Our server recommended the short rib bolognese by rolling her eyes with imagined pleasure when I asked about it, and that seemed like a good sign. The curds held up to frying brilliantly - they must use some kind of good, Wisconsin cheese because it has the tanginess that makes a fried cheese curd great. My short-rib pasta was tasty, but barely warm and seemed like it had been sitting a while (I didn't ask for it to be re-made, though). My date's steak frites was DELICIOUS, and I experienced food envy (she shared generously, though).Gelato of the day, a peanut butter straciatella with a robustly peanut-y flavor, rounded us out (nice sized serving for a single scoop, we shared it). Our server gently discouraged us from ordering the Apple crisp, which I appreciated. Near the end of the meal the owner came through the dining room and greeted a number of people. Nice touch for a nice meal."
4 star rating,"Sat at the bar, but a nice place to hang out and have drinks on a Friday evening. Ordered a burger and it was good, but nothing special. What made the place stand out was the ambiance. Live DJ playing house music, but it was not stupid loud. I felt like I was in a downtown bar in Chicago NYC with the chic decor."
4 star rating,"Loved this place!!! Great atmosphere in the heart of downtown Detroit. Staff are very friendly and the food is excellent. Started with cheese curds and calamari and wings, all excellent. Had the asian ribs which were great as well. Everyone in our group had a great meal and a great time!! We will definitely be back!!"
4 star rating,Came here for dinner on my first night in Detroit. The Look: The interior is super cute and I love how it opens up so you can se the beautiful sky! There was cute community events going on outside so everything felt very safe and vibrant! Parking: I walked over from my friends apartment so I'm not 100% sure about parking but I know there is street parking around the area. Service: The restaurant was pretty empty because it was memorial day but our waitress was super friendly and provided great service!Food: We both got the Detroit Burger which was delicious. Had to order fries on the side and also got the mac and cheese - the fries were a bit soggy but they had great seasoning. The mac and cheese was excellent. Overall I love the atmosphere but the food was average for the price. I would come back on a nice summer day and check out the rest of the menu though !
3 star rating,"Service was nice, food wasn't great.  Tomato soup was cold, fish tacos were bland and overcooked (mostly consisted of undressed shredded lettuce), fried pickles were so overcooked the pickles themselves had no moisture left.  Unfortunate because could be great."
3 star rating,"The service in this place is awful.  A short wait  turned into an hour.  Attitude from the waiter.  Being someone from the service industry, I  understand that it can be difficult.  The problem is this place is ridiculous.Soup was cold.  Steak sat under the heat lamp.  I ate it because I was hungry.  Again being from the service industry I know not to send my dinner back."
1 star rating,"Tried on a recent Saturday night and was surprised at how busy it was just after New Years. I guess I thought everyone would be broke or burned out by the holidays - but not so, the place was jammed. We were told we'd have a 30 minute wait which was only about a 15 minute wait, so not bad. We were put at a 2 person hightop table, near the front of the restaurant across from the bar, it was comfortable if a bit congested. Every time our waitress stopped to take our order, refill drinks, etc., it did cause a bottleneck which meant she was squishing into our table. I liked the menu selections and settled on the duck confit flatbread and the wild mushroom soup. I really liked both of them and thought the price for the flatbread was really reasonable ($11). It had large chunks of duck on it that were tender and delicious. The soup was equally tasty. The only glitch was the waitress asked if I wanted my soup first, I said yes, then she proceeded to bring both items together (and didn't acknowledge the oops).  My bf got the Carnitas tacos, and said they were really good - again at $12, not too bad. I liked the decor and the atmosphere, good location, I'll be back.The good/bad - they have a dj who fired up his music about half way through our meal. A speaker was hanging over our table - we could no longer converse and the music was deafening. We flagged down our waitress and asked her if they could turn down the volume a bit. To our surprise they did, it appears they can control the speakers individually. So while it was still pretty loud in there, and we did have to raise our voices to converse, it was better. So points for trying to fix the problem. I still don't understand the trend though to super noisy restaurant acoustics, I go out to dinner to enjoy my meal and converse. Not sit silently staring at my date or yelling to be heard. Hopefully this trend will backfire soon and restaurants will go back to a civilized volume."
4 star rating,If I could leave minus stars I would! My family attempted a Mother's Day Brunch for me.My pork belly hash arrived cold. The waitress brought us the wrong order.My daughter's Banana Foster arrived crispy and dark brown oozing of grease and a hair which they tried to pass off as emulsified sugar. Our table was wobbly and the experience was a hot mess. We weren't charged for this pitiful experience because the management seemed to be aware of their misgivings. Just dissatisfied and hungry!
3.5 star rating,"I came here before and had a great experience so I brought my mother here for a lunch today. We waited 45 minutes for a salad and edamame. While waiting a couple asked to move to a bigger table near the window, and a waitress moved them to a two top and refused to let them sit in a bigger booth. This was off putting to witness because the venue was no where near capacity. The couple had an appetizer and two drinks and had to be moved 3 times due to the waitress. Finally when the cauliflower salad arrived it looked like this photo. It was supposed to come with cauliflower, green beans, pistachios, cherries and apples. It only came with cauliflower and green beans as evidenced in this photo. We asked the waitress to bring the correct toppings and she said she would and came back to fill up our water without the extra toppings. At this point we asked to speak to a manager and still waited 8 minutes for the manager to come over. Eventually she did and offered ""extra"" toppings and would come the meal. She returned with the toppings which still did not include the apple! It was unbelievable. This is a sad excuse for a salad. Service was awful and the food was not good. I won't be returning."
1 star rating,"Decided to have lunch here as we were meeting a few people for the Holiday Market. Was able to do call ahead seating which was great. Our service was absolutely terrible: did not bring enough waters for everyone in our group, slow on refills and to take our order. The runner who brought out our food was VERY rude as she slammed the plates of food down in the middle of the table, rattled off what each plate was (not caring if they were going to the correct person who ordered them) and running off before asking if we needed anything else (we did need silverware since somehow they couldn't manage to give that to us initially). Food was just OK. I had seen on the menu online you could make your own salad but apparently they are ""brunch only"" on Sundays with a very limited menu which was disappointing. Also, the one bathroom in the restaurant was ""shut down for maintenance"" so we had to use the bathroom at the hotel that is connected to the restaurant. Overall, a lot of inconveniences. was not impressed, I don't recommend and we will not be back."
2 star rating,"Terrible terrible customer service. I could not believe how the hostesses were talking to their guests, I use to come there twice a week for lunch, I will definitely not be coming back again. They need to either retrain or rehire their staff especially the ones you first encounter. Seems like a lot of the dining places in the area forgot how important customer service is."
1 star rating,"I wanted to love it, but never got the chance. I submitted an online request for a reservation for 18 people -- realistically would have probably spent close to $1k. Followed up with a call to confirm they got the online submission and was told I should email the event coordinator, Dawn. No response in 24 hours. Called back and was told Dawn would be paged and would get back to me ASAP. No call ever received. Oh well, going to Gold Cash Gold instead. :-/"
1 star rating,"Central Kitchen + Bar was an incredible experience! Ashley was an amazing bartender (with very strong drinks) for a reasonable price. We had the steak tacos, chicken sandwich, and burger but BY FAR the burger was the best! Our waitress Nicole was hilarious and fun! Atmosphere is family friendly and chic. We will be back :)"
5 star rating,Great food! Went for brunch. Beautiful atmosphere.Downside - 1 unisex bathroom for the place
5 star rating,Worst service ever. Had a call ahead for 7:30 and they sat me at 9!!!!!!!! I understand the time is  not guaranteed but they wouldn't even update us!!! It's such a shame because the food is great. Won't be back.
1 star rating,"Came here for brunch. Service started out solid but slowed significantly after we ordered. I had the burger. Claims to have fried pickles. Who wouldn't order that? It didn't. In fact, it came with nothing for $13. Not a deal-breaker. I'll leave that for the mimosas. $12 with 25 cent refills. If you LOVE orange juice, like really love it, then go ahead and walk a block or two away to a local market and buy two bottles of orange juice and pour it into a glass with a drop or two of cheap champagne and save yourself $4. If you enjoy good, friendly, prompt service, go across the street to Parc who boasts a better menu, ambience and all-around concern for its customers."
2 star rating,"The Buttermilk chicken sandwich was not flavorful. They cover it in ranch to hide that it was not seasoned. The tomato was shriveled not fresh at all. The fish tacos had burnt tortillas. And dry cole slaw. The chef was nice enough to cook mussels that are only on the dinner menu however the waitress made it seem like a very big deal. If that was the case, she should have just said that it wasn't available at lunch. The bread that comes with the mussels were super burnt. (See photo of bread and tortilla) the crawfish sandwich is probably the only good thing on the menu. The ice tea also has no flavor. Tasted like straight lemons. This place is subpar"
3 star rating,Veggie tacos are my fav here. Atmosphere is nice. Every time I've been here and someone has asked to minus something or put it on the side - the food didn't come out as requested.
3.5 star rating,"Went for a Sunday brunch. The place is nice and welcoming with great music and vibes. I orderd the chicken and waffles, the waffles was good but the chicken was obviously cooked in old oil. The chicken was skin crusty and it smelled like the it was cooked in old oil. Noted I came 45 min. Before the kitchen closes but the oil still should be changed. Service was still excilent and It was a nice place to eat."
3 star rating,"Eh.  I was enticed by the website and some friends experiences.  We went on a saturday around 5 pm.  The atmosphere is okay, its pretty hodgepodge designs honestly.Food:  EVERYTHING SALTY.I mean super salty.Like, fill up my cup of water quicker salty.The calamari was served in nice presentation but was salty. My wife had the mussels which were okay but not special.I had the fried chicken sandwich which was dry with a crumbly bun.Overall, a lot of hype but didn't deliver.  Certainly worth a try once or twice but not a regular place to go."
2 star rating,"Super mediocre at best! There is nothing I have had there that blows y mind BUT it is super convenient​ in comparison to where I work. Service is forever slow BUT three stars because I have not ever had a bad drink or waiter/waitress. It also does not help that the restaurant is small and my clothes always smell like this place once I have left. Overall, this place is exactly like the others in the vicinity​ , townhouse included, SUBPAR!"
3 star rating,"I recently had a midday lunch here and had such a very time. I had the custom turkey burger and fries and wow!!! It was great. To top it off m with great service from the female bartender and great conversation with other patrons, what was supposed to be about a one hour visit turned into a 4 hour visit but I didn't care. I will be  here every time I come home to Detroit"
5 star rating,After checking out Detroit's many new places and old favorites you can get mixed results from the same place.  Central provides a consistent comfortable experience you can count on. It's like coming home. Staff always displays a caring friendly professional attitude. The food and drinks are great. Thanks!
5 star rating,"Underwhelming. Food was just ok. Nothing to write home about. Wouldn't go back. Also, not very gluten free friendly or helpful to figure out what was GF."
2 star rating,Good food I guess. But the hostess with the bad eyeliner was the biggest bitch ever (Fire her).
1 star rating,A little pricey for the food but the fig flatbread is worth the raves! Excellent textures and flavor a mixed together! And the desserts were amazing! I especially liked the pound cake with the blueberry gelato! The fish tacos were good too!
4 star rating,"Out of sight out of mind! Just saw the chef wipe sauce off the the spoon onto the plate with no gloves and then wipe his Hands on his pants, the food is so good, my fault for looking into the kitchen. Great place!"
5 star rating,"Great place in Campus Martias to meet for lunch. Exceptional location, ambiance, staff and food. Located in the First National Building, I've been here 3 times since the doors opened, and every time I've been impressed. Layout is great with a full service bar, outdoor patio and garage doors which open up on nice weather days. I enjoyed the Baby Kale salad and added a piece of grilled salmon. Clean, fresh, and healthy. Enjoy!"
3.5 star rating,"So this review is reflective of one experience I had at Central. Prior to this experience I would have generally praised the establishment for being above average food in a good location with acceptable service. I was with a group of coworkers on a Friday after work having drinks, appetizers, and dinners. At some point, we started ordering Tequila + grapefruits. Many were had, but no regrets.... that is until we received our checks. Come to find out we had been served top shelf casamigos the entire time.... over a hundred dollars worth. We never were asked what kind of tequila we wanted at any time nor were we advised what we were served. I can't fault them for trying to serve quality alcohol, but I found the experience to be tacky and sneaky. We challenged the order with the waiter who blamed the bar tender ... teamwork! No consideration was offered for what could be easily explained away as a miscommunication or error on someone's part. It was disappointing to see such poor customer centricity at work and what appeared to be a conspiracy to take advantage of customers. They can do much much better, but unfortunately I won't be returning any time soon to see it. Shame, too, as my office and I were frequent customers."
1 star rating,"I stopped by with sime co-workers on a Wednesday afternoon for appetizers and beverages.  In shortr, I will definitely be returning.The decor is very cool, definitely fits in well in an urban environment and the open air features are certainly a nice touch. Our waitress was fantastic. She gave us opinions when requested and was just the right level of attentive.We ordered a handful of appetizers to share, with the calamari and carnitas nachos being two stand out choices.  We were so pleased with our food choices that we ordered another round after devouring the first.It was extremely busy by the time we left, an indication that this location NEEDED a spot like this.  I to return and get a full meal."
5 star rating,"All hype, very disappointing, terrible service, boring taps, mediocre food.Started with a 1:20 minute wait for a table, we got drinks at Wright & Co during the wait.When asked about the tap selection, our server admitted that she didn't know the beer selection and said ""the cocktails are very good"". When we pushed further on beer she reminded us that she didn't know the beers. She also refused to allow us to sample any.The food was mediocre at best. The Nachos were the sadist excuse for Nachos I've ever seen. Chips with shredded pork, shredded lettuce, and sour cream, thats it! No cheese, no beans, no salsa. Trying too hard, I guess.My turkey burger was dry and the bun was much to chewy. Her chickpea veggie burger was much better, and the whole wheat bun was great. The fries were fair.I will not be going back, even to try the cocktails."
1 star rating,I can not believe the arrogance that they would not allow me to sub out chips with their burger with fries. I have never experienced this at any restaurant in my entire life.
1 star rating,"Great food, drinks, and ambiance! Looking forward to coming back with friends and family."
5 star rating,"I've been here a few times now for weekday lunches. The food is pretty good (worth the price tag), and you're usually seated right away. I was here last Friday, with some coworkers, and everyone loved their food (we had flatbreads, mussels, burgers, and tacos).  So, why only 3 stars? Because the service is super slow. While the food didn't take too long to bring out, closing out and getting our checks took about 30 minutes. All of the tables in our section seemed to falling prey to the same problem, so perhaps there was an issue with connectivity? In any case, I hope this isn't a recurring issue, but maybe Friday lunch-rush issue. Fingers crossed!"
3 star rating,"Was able to get right and in seated on a cold Saturday in March around lunch.   Very prime location for those spending time in Downtown in the warmer months, so I can imagine there being a wait on some days.  My husband was really excited to eat here for brunch, but for me nothing on their brunch menu had me really excited, so I was going to go with the burger.  When my husband ordered the Chicken Biscuit dish, our server mentioned how the Chef's waffle presentation was Chicken and Waffles, so I quickly switched from the burger to the waffle.  It was so much more then your standard fried chicken strips and basic Belgium waffles.  Can't figure out what they do differently with their waffles but it was delicious.  Chicken was fresh and crunchy and it all was a delicious combined with the maple syrup.  I was worried about it not being enough food with how hungry I was but it came with two decent size pieces of chicken.  I do believe they charged more for the Waffle meal even though it says $10 on the menu, we realized this later in the day though. I will be back to this location, and hope they make this a permanent meal on the menu.  They also validate parking, we found this on their website but you have to park in a certain parking garage,  This was a plus for me as it was a cold day and parking too far away would have been brutal."
4 star rating,"Central Kitchen + Bar has good food! I always get the mussels and prosciutto dish and it's very good. I must admit however that I am giving this place 5 stars not because of the food, but for a combination of reasons. It's the mixture of the food, the ambiance, and the price level, that make me really appreciate a place like Central Kitchen + Bar in Detroit. If you are looking for trendy and sexy dinner spot with good food I would definitely recommend this place!Pros- They give you free popcorn during HH- You can park directly in front of the restaurant, it is metered, but very safe and convenient"

2 star rating,"If you have no tastebuds or a fanatic over bland food this is the place for you! My friend and I went there yesterday, February 23rd, instead of going to shake shack. We regretted our decision once we each took one bite of our food. I ordered the Detroit burger and was severely disappointed. The homemade chips were delicious, the burger itself was bland. It was a bar, my friend and I don't drink, but after the ""food"" that we ate, we wish we could've drank all the drinks that were available, at least then, in our drunken state, the food would be subpar. Service was good though."
3.5 star rating,"Stoped into this restaurant after the Rhonda Walker 5K with the family. They have a very nice atmosphere the windows were open and it has a very open air feel inside, the weather was very nice it was warm enough to eat outside. They did not have high chairs to accommodate little ones or the booster seats however I understand this is a downtown bar so next time I'll  call ahead. The host was very accommodating and sat us in a booth right next to the window open to the outside. I ordered the tropic thunder which had Gin in it. It has pineapple as well, it's not very tropical however it is refreshing. We ordered the Belgian waffle and the Vegetable Strata. The berry compote was a nice compliment and went well with the waffle. The waffle was great. The vegetable strata is like a warm baked casserole with caramelized onions mushrooms and other veggies in a bowl, it  comes with a salad. There are many more items on their menu and I'd like to come back definitely a must-try."
3 star rating,"Great restaurant and the food is amazing. I went with a huge groups and they were quick and well prepared. They did did however forget to make my Order but immediately Made it with in minutes. They gave it to me on the house! Overall great experience and food, 10/10 always recommend."
5 star rating,A great stop for lunch. Enjoyed everything I ate and wouldn't change anything. Busy and fun atmosphere the service was outstanding. Fast and friendly. One minor suggestion would be to add a few more delicious selections to the menu.
4 star rating,"The vegetarian tacos were spectacular!! Sarah our waitress was nice, and the location is a fun section of Detroit to walk around."
5 star rating,"Solid dinner spot in downtown Detroit. Mussels on the appetizer menu were on-point, and they did a great job with cocktails. I ordered the steak frites, while my wife ordered a bolognese pasta. Both were excellent. Would definitely return."
4 star rating,"Pleasantly surprised!  A family friend recommended this place but their Yelp rating wasn't too high so I was a little cautious going in.  The atmosphere and service were excellent!  Food was delicious, a little on the pricey side.  Everyone in my party cleaned their plates.  We had the Fish tacos, Crawfish burger, Buttermilk fried chicken sandwich, and Lamb rack.  The Lamb rack was perfectly seasoned and cooked to temp.  The Fried cheese curds were delicious as well, but would have liked a larger portion."
5 star rating,"I thought this was an excellent place to go. I met a friend downtown and we walked here and were immediately seated. It was a Tuesday night and it was full of people. We ordered the flatbread that had Brussel sprouts. I don't like brussel sprouts so I didn't eat it but will say that everyone else liked it. I ordered the cauliflower salad with salmon for my main course and that was excellent. I really enjoyed the flavors that were coming out of all of the items in the salad. You could taste every flavor. The salmon was cooked very well also. I would say that you should order meat to go along with this salad since it is on the smaller side. For desert I ordered the fried ice cream. The ice cream was not fried but was with tortillas chips underneath it. Not sure I would get this desert again. I thought it needed a little more flavor. Since ice cream is good, we all enjoyed it. I will definitely come back here again. I thought it was a great experience and would like to try more on the menu."
4 star rating,"Got here a little later, 10pm. It was dead for a Friday night. The server came over right away but we asked for a few minutes to pick a drink. He never came back! Then we were brought our appetizer and didn't have silverware. Food was subpar. The worst thing was seeing all the kitchen staff, servers, and even manager eating chicken wings and stuffing their faces during service. Not a good look!"

3 star rating,This place should have 5 stars. The interior is so cute it includes an outside patio but it's heated so it's actually enjoyable. The Bloody Mary's are to die for and so is the burger. I highly recommend this place for people that enjoy a comfortable couch setting instead of chairs and for mimosas
3.5 star rating,"A tad bit small but a really nice funky place to grab a drink. Didn't sample the food, it's a bit pricey. Really enjoyed the wide selection of beer. Good music also."
4 star rating,"Went with a large group of family and friends for my birthday on a Saturday night. Easily was able to get a table and service was great and quick. The food was phenominal. Since we had a large party, our order consisted of vegetarian tacos, herbed fries, central burger, buttermilk battered chicken, and mac & cheese. Everyone LOVED their food and we tend to be quite picky through a mixed crowd of vegetarians and meat eaters. The prices are higher, but well worth it for the quality and sizes of the meals."
5 star rating,"very noisy, menu on-line out of date they no longer have any sides.  Got the salmon underwhelming flavor, undercooked and overcooked in one piece."
2 star rating,"Central is worth a shot. It's small and can be hard to get a table. The cheese curds are amazing, I also like the fig flat bread and my friend enjoys the mussels. The menu isn't huge but the prices are fair for this area of Detroit. I especially enjoy trying their dessert menu which they like to change up."
4 star rating,Best service ever! Me and my girlfriend are traveling from out of town and we were blown away by the bartenders. Nicest people ever! (7/06/2018) also way good food! The vegetarian tacos were so awesome! Hands down best place in Detroit.
5 star rating,Probably one of the worst meals I've had in Detroit in the past three years.  Service was good but the food was atrocious.  Bolognese was cream based which has never been seen before..... then I ordered the ceviche which was gazpacho with three pieces of shrimp.  Horrible food go elsewhere.... drinks were good though
2 star rating,Came here on a Saturday with my fiancé. It was relatively quiet when we arrived but got much more crowded as the night went on. We ordered drinks to start and our waitress was very knowledgeable. I had the ahi tuna salad which was awesome! My finance had the shrimp and grits and he said it was excellent. The vibe was so cool and casual. I really enjoyed my time here! Will definitely be back.
4 star rating,"Pretty miserable experience, both the service and food. Our party of 4 arrived after a Red Wings game and was seated after 30 minutes at the bar. The drinks and apps at the bar were good. Then the ordeal began. The server showed at the table at mostly random times, always at least 15 minutes apart. The onion soup came with the cheese separator paper still in the soup. 30 minutes later, when the manager arrived, she said it was only the cheese paper, and had happened 3 other times that night. The manager didn't make it out until after 3/4 our meals arrived. 10 minutes later the fourth meal made it to the table.The shrimp and grits were ok, the tacos good, except for the hard cold tortillas. Then the wait began. With long waits between seeing our server, we were offered desserts. The recommended cookie ice cream sandwich was impossible to eat, the cookies rock hard. The ganache torte was not well done either.With all the other options available in Detroit, we won't be back at Central Kitchen + Bar. It isn't worth the cost, quality or poor service."
2 star rating,Stopped in the bar to escape the rain on the night of the Fireworks. Staff was very friendly and found us a seat at the bar. After a few drinks we decided to share the Buttermilk Chicken sandwich and fries. Sandwich was huge and delicious. Great experience. Thanks
4 star rating,"StaffWe arrived at 10 pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant has a cute atmosphere with outdoor seating available. When we walked in, the hostess did not seem very friendly. She did not smile and was very matter of fact. We were told there was only one group ahead of us but it would be a 40 minute wait due to people lingering. As we were contemplating leaving and going to a different restaurant she told us to hold on and can give us a table in ten minutes. My suggestion for management would be to avoid telling customers the wait is 40 minutes when tables are actually available so that they don't end up losing patrons. We sat down at the table right by the kitchen. We saw a booth was open and asked to sit there but the same hostess said she was about to seat a table of 8 people there (the table ended up staying open all night). So overall customer service by the hostess could have been a lot better and we should have been able to sit at the open table we desired. In regards to our waitress, she was friendly and attentive. FoodLoved the calamari. Spicy with jalapeños, nuts, onions, mandarin oranges. I recommend this!Detroit burger- good but I generally don't get fancy with my hamburgers and usually order a classic American kind, so I can't judge the Detroit burger accurately. However we ordered it medium well and it was served well done. This happens everywhere I go and Central was no exception. I hate an over cooked burgerSeasoned Fries- good and comes with a garlic type dipping sauce. Carne asada tacos- good, 2 large tacos. steak was perfectly cooked (medium I believe). Dish comes with tortilla chips and a salsa verdeNutella brownie with chocolate ice cream - YUM! Was told by my friend that this sells out so we ""reserved it"" when we first sat down. Overall I liked the food and the menu has a nice selection of all different types of dishes. I look forward to trying different items next time."
3.5 star rating,Great spot to just chill with great Detroit local and tourist. Please a must try is the Duck in a Jar.... I know I had the same reaction. Sounds crazyyyy.. But gets your tastebuds going.
4 star rating,"Wonderful food and overall experience at the Kitchen & Grill on Saturday the 2nd!  Food adventure in selections of starters, main courses and sides. Atmosphere is fairly quiet and cozy with just the right amount of mellow with pizazz. The Chicken Paillard was excellent with a hint of spice (hot) on the finish!  Go Chef!"
5 star rating,"Ordered fish tacos which were very good, but very overpriced. The location of Central Kitchen in the heart of Campus Martius and downtown Detroit makes it an ideal spot for good drinks and good food but not for the price."
4 star rating,"I had the Ahi Tuna and it was disappointing. It tasted good, but it was EXTREMELY small. It was listed under salads for $16. While I didn't expect a lot of tuna, I was expecting a decent salad, especially for this price. But no, almost no salad there..."
2 star rating,"Went here in Detroit with my extended family -- we ordered basically the entire menu. The food was good and everybody enjoyed themselves. ESPECIALLY THE MUSSELS APPETIZER WHICH WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD. Yes, i have the pickiest fuckin palette of all time, and the sauce the mussels came in was outrageous!!! This restaurant locked down a sexy piece of real estate, especially considering the development this area of Detroit is going to see in the upcoming decade. They have a great vibe to their establishment and are super accommodating to large parties. Finding good food in Detroit is tough -- try this place out if you're with a big group and just wanna eat. (nice bar too)"
4 star rating,"Central - so glad you've decided to join the downtown party.A perfect location, right on Cadillac Square. The atmosphere is old meets new - feels very hip with whitewashed walls, lights, and mirrors abound. A great spot to pop in when you want to eat somewhere trendy and avoid Fountain Bistro's mediocrity.Also, you won't go broke eating here; the dishes are reasonably priced for a downtown establishment. They do a mix of burgers, tacos, flatbreads, and mains - something for everyone. The carnitas tacos are awesome - very succulent and flavorful. The fig flat bread is great, as is the prosciutto (if you love Gorgonzola, get this!). Great service. Not a huge space, but they have lots of different seating area types, including outdoor in the summer.Minor critique: I'd like to see the cocktail menu get revamped."
4 star rating,"Great ambiance and great place to grab drinks. Some friends and I came here for dinner and drinks and we were seated pretty fast on a Saturday night. I ordered the Rickshaw from the cocktail menu and had them muddle jalepenos in it and I think I created my new favorite drink! It was delicious and spicy. The lamb loin chops were very tender and seasoned perfectly, the fries had an delicious season on them and the fried cheese curds were great. All of the food we ordered was all very good. On the other hand, the desserts we ordered were not so good. I had a bite of both the cheesecake crepes and salted caramel mousse, and one bite was all I needed. I'm usually eating dessert til the last bite but they weren't worth it to me. The staff was very nice and the crowd was very fun. I'd definitely come back but I just wouldn't save room for dessert :("
4 star rating,"Not a good experience Sunday morning for breakfast. Issues too numerous to go into, but in summary: we sat down at the bar to eat and could not get the attention of the server. She finally laid down menus in the mess from the previous patrons. We asked her to wipe the bar and she took the menus away. We moved to a table and struggled the entire meal to flag down our server. Server was angry and seemed to be crying at one point. Food was served cold and french fries were hard. Orange juice had ice cubes in it. Was never offered a coffee refill. While the french toast and omelette were tasty, there is something wrong with the operations here, and I would not go back for breakfast."
2 star rating,"Food is good, drinks are good, great locationMenu contains great takes on standard dishes (burgers, sandwiches, tacos and some common entrees).  As for drinks, have only had their unfashionable, but that was a tasty item - not sure it's worth the 12 dollar price tag.AppsWings - skip these and go straight to sweet waterCheese curds - don't skip these, they are worth itEntreesCentral Burger - won't let you downChicken Sandwich - very good option, well rounded flavorCuban Sandwich - good take on a classicCarne Asada Tacos - It's no Mexican town, but they are still good"
4 star rating,"Every business has its negatives and positives, since no one likes ending on a sour note...The not-so-good about Central Kitchen + Bar: Even though my friend was able to make a reservation for 2 people for 6:30 on a Wed night, we still had to wait to get seated. The hostess had this blank look like she's not sure what a reservation is. I ordered the duck confit flatbread, waited for 20+ minutes for it to come out, and it was the wrong one and was warm at best (the fig/goat cheese/brussel sprouts flatbread). I understand the feel of the place is supposed to be very industrial/hipster, but it is way too loud in there between drunk happy hour folks and the lack of padding to absorb any sound. I couldn't carry on a normal conversation without yelling across a tiny table even if I tried.The good things about Central Kitchen + Bar: It has a nice patio area, great for happy hour. The signature cocktails looked yummy and everyone there seems to be having one. It was packed on a Wednesday night, so it bodes well for their quality of food, which is just as important as having a good atmosphere in a restaurant. I had the Bistro Onion soup (baked French Onion soup) and that was delightful. They did mess up my order, but did fix it and brought me my Duck Confit Flatbread quickly and allowed me to take home the ""wrong"" flatbread without charging me extra. The Duck Confit flatbread was very good as well. The duck was tender and I'm a sucker for pizzas/flatbreads that has a runny egg on it.So, overall, I was glad I had gone there and had tried their food, but I'm not sure about going back."
3.5 star rating,"Last night I ordered an Ahi Tuna salad to go, got home, no tuna. I talked to the manager and she said come in tomorrow on your lunch break and we will give you another salad. I called to place the order today for an Ahi Tuna Ceaser Salad, got all the way back to my office, no Tuna! Called and talked to the manager and he basically told me that he did not believe me, that they double checked the box. No, I can assure you I don't have that kind of time in my day to call you for no reason. My Company does a lot of Team dinners here, and I am very disappointed in the repeated mistake as well as the steps taken to try and make it right. #lowlevelI received a voicemail from Thomas the manager saying he thinks a miscommunication on my part, are you serious?"
1 star rating,"Nice atmosphere that seems to revolve around the bar. It's nice in there but kind of standard new restaurant feel with no Detroit authenticity to it. I've sat at the bar and outside. The bar was nice, it's more square than most, which made you always feel like you were close to a bartender. And the heaters outside were lovely, despite the chill in the wind, we were plenty warm.The service was fine. They were attentive and appropriate. You almost didn't even realize they were there. Which for some people is the best kind of waitstaff service. But they weren't winning any awards in my book.The food on the menu all sounds pretty amazing. The descriptions explain these ingredients that sound delicious and refreshingly new. But it's mostly standard again. You expect to bite into an array of flavors and a combination that could bring this restaurant to the next level. But then your met with food that isn't impactful, it's all a little bland and therefore makes the meal weak.The only thing I would actually recommend here is the nachos. But I doubt I'll be super eager to come back here."
3 star rating,"Every time we've visited this establishment, whether for just drinks or an entire dinner experience, we have not been disappointed.  Tonight, we came over for dinner after not being able to get a table elsewhere.  We certainly did not feel we were ""settling"" by coming here.  We had the PEI mussles as an appetizer and were very pleased. My handsome husband had the short rib ragu for his entree and was absolutely satisfied.  I had the soba noodle salad and was totally pleased with the flavors and composition."
4 star rating,"Great food, excellence service with a smile by Maria. In the downtown district not far from the waterfront."
5 star rating,"Fun busy city restaurant. Great service (thanks Brittany), great food, great location. We ordered two different salads- Ahi tuna salad and the roasted cauliflower salad with salmon. Both were excellent and fresh. We will be back!"
4 star rating,The Croque Madame was out of this world! The truffle aolie is amazing. Highly recommend the chorizo tacos were delicious and the French toast is huge. Great service and experience.
5 star rating,"If I could give negative stars to this place I would definitely not hesitate a second! I am sharing my story below to make everyone aware of what happened to me and what could happen to you. We had a dinner here and got a bill of almost $90. Forget about the average/below average food and service we got. Few days later, I discover AN EXTRA HUNDRED DOLLARS CHARGED  on my bank statement !!!! I immediately call the restaurant to see what exactly happened, and the person who handled the call gave me a manager's email address ; Colin, to write him an email and explain the situation. It was the weirdest answer as the least to expect is taking full responsibility of such a terrible mistake. I hung up the phone and wrote an email to Colin with a copy of the actual receipt that I luckily kept. Of course, i never heard back until i called two times later at the restaurant's number and left a message with my phone number to call me back. Finally, Colin calls apologizing for what happened and said they will send a check to my address. The least to expect is knowing it was a mistake rather than money stealing. The WORST PART is that I never got a check, and when i called to see what exactly is going on, the manager said the ""re-fund"" check was sent out to me on Saturday (almost a week after our conversation!!). A reputable restaurant would take an immediate action to justify the horrible incident and take whatever it takes to resolve the problem. Apparently they depend on fooling people who never check their bank accounts. Please be careful."
1 star rating,"Delicious food, energetic atmosphere, and perfect location. The Central Mule was refreshing and the Carne Asada tacos were filling and delicious -- at the same time, maybe a little too salty for my taste. Also, I wasn't at all impressed with the salsa verde; I'm usually a big fan, but this particular batch was completely bland. Overall, I'd highly recommend a visit here but be prepared for a loud + lively atmosphere (especially on the weekends)!"
4 star rating,"Nice atmosphere and very good service, but the food was fair to poor. Went for a Tuesday night dinner when it was not busy at all. Steamed mussels with chorizo were so salty we could barely get it down. Bistro salad was nice. Entree-wise, the chicken paillard with root vegetables was pretty good, but the shrimp and grits was so oily and oversalted that most of it got left on the plate. Maybe we should have stuck with a sandwich or a pizza, but I simply can't justify paying the premium this place commands for such basic fare.Menu is thoughtful, but our food was just poorly executed.  Overall, has potential if the kitchen gets its act together, but currently not worth a trip considering all the other fine options nearby."
2 star rating,"Central Kitchen is just in its infancy, but already doing some pretty great things. I stopped in for dinner with a couple friends and was pleasantly surprised by almost everything. For starters we had the mussels, calamari, and the fried cheese curds. I cannot tell you how delicious the calamari was! By far the most interesting and flavorful I have ever had. It was tangy with a little kick, and enjoyed eating the snap peas and little pieces of oranges that came with it. The mussels and cheese curds were also very good. As the entree, I was torn between the fish or the carnitas tacos, and at the recommendation of our waitress I went with the fish. I wish I chose the carnitas instead! They were fine--definitely edible but not quite enjoyable. Perhaps my expectations were too high from how good the appetizers were, or perhaps my standards are too high because I've had some killers fish tacos on in my life, but they seriously fell flat. The salsa verde that came on the side, however, was fantastic and saved the dish from failure. To drink, I stuck with one of their cocktails called the Rickshaw all night. It was light and refreshing, but at $10 each I would've hoped for a little more buzz after drinking 2!"
3.5 star rating,Perfect melt in your mouth filet. Fries with the dipping sauce were delicious. Tuna Tartare taste very fresh.
5 star rating,"Excellent service, great atmosphere!  Revolving food menu is current & has good variety.  Try the lettuce wraps - a surprise awaits!"
5 star rating,"We came for Sunday brunch yesterday and were blown away. Amazing food, mimosas were strong and of great value. And for the meal, I got French toast. It was perfection. The decor and vibe was urban chic. Alejandro was our server and he took great care of us (3 girls and a guy from Georgia). Definitely returning on my next trip to Detroit!"
5 star rating,Absolutely love this new addition to downtown. The food is amazing and the cocktails are even better.
5 star rating,Pulled Both the Cuban and the pulled pork tacos off their menu.   They have really reduced their menu size.... shame.
3 star rating,"Frequent this place for lunch, the tacos are amazing, but the Cuban sandwich leaves something to be desired, its a little bland. Have never had poor service here and will be back!"
4 star rating,I have been here many times. The food and drinks are always delicious. The pomegranate martini is a must have. Brunch with House Music DJ Bruce Bailey on Sundays is a must do. The fig bread is delicious. Yes to this entire place.
5 star rating,Creative and Tasty Saturday brunch!! Served until 3pm. Great food & cocktails.  Neat looking industrial decor.  The outdoor closed-in patio with heat lamps.  Comfy outdoor furniture too.  You must go!
5 star rating,"Delicious with an awesome location! We got the herb fries, a huge pile, but totally worth it. Maybe get them with a group, as we were only 2. I ordered the salmon, which was surprisingly good with the curry base. My husband got the scallops, which were to die for. The cocktail menu was good, and they had fried ice cream which I hope to try next time. All around good choice!"
5 star rating,"Central kitchen has consistently good service, food and a drink. The tuna tartar and calamari are excellent appetizers. The cheese plate is just okay in terms of what you get but it is a nice size. They have a really nice happy hour with cocktail, beer, wine and appetizer specials. I recently had the Detroit burger with the truffle fries which were excellent. My parents ordered the shrimp and grits and salmon and were very happy with their meals as well. I had the Refresher course to drink which was okay but my mom's Moscow mule was very good. My dad ordered a beer at the recommendation of our waiter who was also nice enough to give him a sample. I have sat at the bar, high tops and outside all which are comfortable. The last time I went they had a DJ at dinner time which made it really hard to have conversation. Otherwise, this is a really great casual place to grab a drink and a bite to eat."
4 star rating,"I was really excited to visit Central Kitchen after perusing their menu online. But our group was very disappointed when we visited for brunch to find an extremely limited menu and flippant service. I wanted to really like this place and the experience, but I left annoyed. Location/Atmosphere: 2.5/5. Great location, but didn't love the atmosphere inside. Central Kitchen is LOUD. The acoustics are strange--I could barely hear the person next to me, but heard the conversations of people on the other side of the restaurant in perfect clarity. For brunch, they had seated most tables in the same corner of the restaurant, which felt very cramped. The tables are massive, and the booths don't leave enough room underneath them--our group was basically playing footsie for the whole time. The vibe looks chic at first glance, but past the facade-- it's not all that great. Service: 2/5. We experienced poor and snippy service when we visited. It took quite a while to place orders--15 minutes after when we sat down. We asked for clarification about menu items, and either got incorrect information, or no answer at all. Every time we asked for anything--silverware, extra sauce, more water, etc-- the server seemed peeved. Food and Drink: 3/5. The Bloody Mary here was a highlight--it's garnished with really unique tasting pickles, and pleasantly spicy. Coffee was also good, but you can get that next door at the roasting company. The only tea selection offered was a green tea, which is absurd. If you are going to have tea on your menu, you need black and green at a minimum. Our party's real annoyance at our experience was the limited brunch menu. There were very few items available, and the menu was skewed toward red meat and pork items. There were 2 savory vegetarian-friendly items on the menu, and one was a salad. When my vegetarian friend asked for a recommendation for a meat-free dish, the waitress suggested a bagel (which was listed on the menu as a side!) or a waffle. Of the choices offered, most dishes had either pork or beef as a main feature; this is pretty annoying, to be honest. If you're going to market yourself as a bougie and hip spot to eat, you should have veg, poultry, fish, and red meat options that are equally attractive. My friend ended up asking for tacos without the meat--they were supposed to have potatoes and eggs as well as chorizo-- but received essentially coleslaw and cheese on tortillas. Overall: I'm disappointed with my recent experience here. Their lunch and dinner menus look amazing...I'm tempted to try again the next time I'm in Detroit--but honestly there are so many good restaurants here now that blow this one away. I do NOT recommend Central Kitchen for brunch."
3.5 star rating,"This place has been in my list to try for a while and I have been non stop thinking about the fig flatbread since I saw it on the menu. I gave Central 4 stars because the atmosphere where the food was more 3 stars. I would describe it as a ""hip"" place and loved the decor and vibe. The food was average, good but nothing special. I got the fig flatbread and it was what I had expected it to taste like, lots of flavor and very rich. I would recommend the flatbread, but most likely try something new next time. I will be back, but most likely just for drinks and apps!"
4 star rating,"My third time here for brunch - we love the $0.25 mimosa refills. The food is generally good but this time (Sunday) they seemed to be out of a lot of things. I've actually never had a restaurant out of so many ingredients as Central today and I eat out a lot!  Their menu has a pork belly hash and they were out of pork belly and had been for ""two weeks"" according to our server and were substituting bacon on the side. They also ran out of orange juice for mimosas after our first round (and we were seated at 11:15 am - right after they opened) and had to send an employee out to a store to buy more juice!  We went an hour without a full mimosa refill!  Finally, they didn't have cream for our coffee - only watered down milk - as per our server, they were trying to make the milk last longer!  We had a good sized table and given that they weren't too busy, we really should have had a manger come over to address the situation. Given our prior history, will probably try one more time, but downtown is full of good brunch spots, so they need to up their game!!"
3 star rating,Good vibes but wasnt too impressed by the burger. The truffle fries were pretty good!
3 star rating,The Wait isn't bad at all. Went on a Saturday evening. Good location. Good service. Food is alright.
3 star rating,"Solid dinner spot in downtown Detroit. Mussels on the appetizer menu were on-point, and they did a great job with cocktails. I ordered the steak frites, while my wife ordered a bolognese pasta. Both were excellent. Would definitely return."
4 star rating,"Arrived Sat night at 6pm and no wait, inside or out, which was a bit surprising. Had drinks at the bar then enjoyed dinner. 4 of us started w calamari and fig flatbread. Both were great although the flatbread was a bit too sweet. Maybe fresh figs instead of fig jam would solve this problem. For dinner, the 4 of us tried to do too much, splitting this and that, and we made a bad decision in the end that we all regretted. 2 of us split Central burger, and the others the Detroit burger. Both were great. We then ended up ordering 2 orders of Asian Ribs... How did this happen??? Lol. The problem was, they werent that good. Very salty sauce and the slaw that came with it was quite spicy. Overall, a very nice experience. Definitely will want to head back to try some of the other menu items. The cauliflower salad looked great. Skipped dessert bc we got bummed at the end by the ribs, but also because we wanted to try Detroit Water Ice. That was a bit disappointing too. If you go, i would say stick to the fruity flavors."
4 star rating,"Ate there about 15 times, probably had everything on the menu and their food sucks and service is hit or miss. I used to love their Sunday brunch, but now every time I go they don't have half the menu available. Change your menu if you can't serve the food that's on it. Even if I love close by and it's somewhat a cute place I will never eat there again!"

1 star rating,"Their breakfast chorizo tacos were so bland I had to pour a ton of hot sauce on them to muscle them down. Their burger was ok but not worth ordering again. The ambience is great, I wish the food was better."
2 star rating,"Vibe was really cool. Is a great place for drinks and grabbing some good food with friends. It's a bit noisy, but it's a great place for a gathering with friends. On a nice night, you should request to sit in their patio area - it's inside the building still but they have the windows that get drawn up. Food was delicious and the waitstaff were super friendly and energetic."
3.5 star rating,"Fantastic meal. Casual atmosphere with hip clientele. Mussels were fantastic, we had burgers and tacos and all really good. Tried a side of Mac and cheese and that as good too. Came on a Friday night and the place was happening."
5 star rating,"This place was suggested by a friend, went for dinner on a Monday night. I ordered the sea scallops with beet ravioli because it sounded interesting and delicious. I was shocked to see the small amount of food for $28. Presentation was great, and taste was good but nothing to overcome the fact I was given 3 ravioli and 3 scallops for that price. I have been to plenty of other nice restaurants and more trendy places and have been given more food than that for an entree. I was turned off by that entirely. I give it some stars because everyone else enjoyed their meals (burgers and tacos) and the beer/wine list was good. Just don't order an entree or ask serving size before you order."
2 star rating,It was a busy Friday but we were greeted by a very friendly host who was able to seat us almost immediately. My friend and I sat right in front of the kitchen against the windows with lights. Beautiful atmosphere and decorations. Our waitress Jacqueline was awesome and very friendly. The cocktails we started with we're fantastic. I got the Cat's Meow and my friend got the specialty cocktail and we were both very pleased. We then got their Fig Jam flat bread. The brussel sprouts were perfection. For the main course we both ordered tacos Fish & Vegetarian and I was in love. My friend had a couple of restrictions but our waitress was so nice about it and made sure everything we ordered was something she could have. There was not a morsel left on our plates. Because everything else was so good...we had to get dessert. Lemon pound cake with blueberry ice cream. So delicious. Will definitely be coming back again!
5 star rating,Great location across from Campus Martius!  Have eaten here a few times and the pork sandwich never disappoints!  My favorite item is the shrimp & grits!
4 star rating,"We went for brunch last Sunday and had a great time. The atmosphere was awesome and the food was delicious. I had the frittata which I would highly recommend! The food was a bit pricey, but understandable with the quality of food. Yum!"
4 star rating,"Hello, I just wanted to express why I will not be dining with you guys anytime in the near future or possibly ever again. This was my second time in Central and I know and understand why my coworkers in the first national building are not too fond of the place. The bar service was not good at all. I'm a pretty reasonable person since I have too worked as a bar waitress in my younger days, so I know how it can be but I also know and understand how a customer should be treated. After, it was made clear that I was disturbing the female bartender from counting money/drawer I waited patiently for assistance. Even after she finished with the money she continued to chat a bit with a coworker. Ok, fine as well, it could have been important. Then, once she decided to come over she took my drink order, provided drink and left to sit down with friends and eat. I was pretty hungry myself so I could relate. I stopped a waitress in passing and asked ""is food served at the bar?"" she said ""yes"" and grabbed the bartender away from other workers who were probably on a break. I placed a food order but then cancelled and paid for a barely touched drink because clearly I was not wanted there and decided to go eat across the street at the Bistro before my party joined me. I take it as if you don't want me to spend money there then why should I?"

5 star rating,"Average burgers.  What's worse is that we were seated at a table under a leaking pipe.  We were leaked on!  We mentioned to the server who said ""yeah, we can't do anything about that"".  Um yes you can....don't seat people under there!  Or maybe give complimentary something when someone complains instead of shrug shoulders?"
3.5 star rating,"Got here a little later, 10pm. It was dead for a Friday night. The server came over right away but we asked for a few minutes to pick a drink. He never came back! Then we were brought our appetizer and didn't have silverware. Food was subpar. The worst thing was seeing all the kitchen staff, servers, and even manager eating chicken wings and stuffing their faces during service. Not a good look!"
3 star rating,"This used to be my favorite laid back restaurant in the city, and I would frequent it with my gf and friends often. Dining here tonight, I learned that the restaurant changed their menu in order to focus on a more ""upscale"" clientele and atmosphere. In doing that, they removed the cheese curds and the hot wings from the menu, two of mine and my friend's favorites. I don't believe the restaurant listens to their diners, and I hope they can bring back the classic menu that everyone is used to. Love the waitstaff, bartenders, and food, but this is a step in the wrong direction for the restaurant. Willing to delete review for cheese curds."
2 star rating,"The good and the bad:This place had been on my list of must check-outs.  The place seems modern without being cold.  Accessible enough for a casual night out with friends and elegant enough for date night.  We were told our wait would be an hour.  An hour and 40 minutes later, we had our table.  I have to say... that was a problem.  The bar staff... wait, one of the bartenders and our waitress apologized and kept checking on us.  The initial bartender (should have gotten her name) came over to us and was off-putting with her personality and lack of engagement.  One person in our group said they wanted a sweeter drink.  The bartender informed her that none of drinks on their menu where that sweet.  She didn't offer up other options.  She just walked off.  The other bartender was much more interested in customer service. It did seem that our waitress was a bit extended and had tables in multiple zones.  She was rushing all over the place to service her tables.  We were set by the DJ booth.  Now let me stop here for a second on this.  They paid a guy to basically play music that is in the background.. like a tertiary addition to the environment.  I am just saying... a playlist would do just fine.    Next thing.  He and people that he knew, kept talking over our table.  This was extremely annoying.  I had to say something a few times to get them to stop.  The good.  Plus for the burger.  Juicy, good cheese used.  great texture.  Good flavor.  The Bistro salad was good.  Better than you basic mixed green salad.  The bad.  The cookie sandwich... well I could skip it.  The cookie was the consistency of a standard store-bought cookie.  Not soft at all.  Pieces of cookie would go flying if you try to cut into the sandwich.  It wasn't warm, or chewy... I am just saying... the ice cream sandwiches at Potbelly's are 20 times better (just to give a juxtaposition).  The green chili soup.  This should not be called soup  It is more like a bowl of salsa.  The simple fix would be to put it on some nachos or huevos rancheros and stop calling it soup.Décor: 5 out of 5Food:  3 out of 5Drinks:  4 out of 5Service: 2 out of 5Cleanliness:  4 out of 5"

5 star rating,"Pleasantly surprised!  A family friend recommended this place but their Yelp rating wasn't too high so I was a little cautious going in.  The atmosphere and service were excellent!  Food was delicious, a little on the pricey side.  Everyone in my party cleaned their plates.  We had the Fish tacos, Crawfish burger, Buttermilk fried chicken sandwich, and Lamb rack.  The Lamb rack was perfectly seasoned and cooked to temp.  The Fried cheese curds were delicious as well, but would have liked a larger portion."
3.5 star rating,"Birthday Party Blunder! Was just there last night for a birthday party with about 12 people. All couples. The service started off well. Our hosts were pleasant and our table was ready as soon as we walked in. Our server, however, was less than attentive to say the least. Cashing out was completely unacceptable as it took over an hour (yes, I'm not kidding) for our checks to hit the table, not to mention all of the checks were incorrect! Our server then proceeded to blame us as the guests for moving seats throughout our service  (Restaurant Industry 101: never throw blame on the guest). The checks continued to be butchered so badly that one person from our party had to throw down his credit card on the whole bill just to get us cashed out and out of the restaurant after an hour and a half of an uncomfortable fiasco. Our crew of people spent A LOT of money, and instead of earning his gratuity, when checks hit the table, a 20 percent gratuity was ALREADY added and we as guests were not informed of that ahead of time which should always be done at the beginning of service with large parties. I'm all for compensating and over tipping wait-staff, but when it is warranted. Central Kitchen has certainly gone down hill since it's opening a couple of years ago, and if they want to stay relevant to compete against the rapid rise of the restaurant/service industry in Detroit they are going to need to assess their quality of service and timing standards. **I do want to note that you can always assure that you will get tasty and delicious food here so props to the kitchen staff for that!**"
2 star rating,"Disclaimer: I visited with two friends on the last day of the Detroit Jazz Festival on the Monday of Labor Day weekend. They were officially entering ""the rush"". We were seated immediately at our dream table, the last open 4 top with a perfect view of the jazz performance. However, it was 20 minutes and a host stand visit later until we were even greeted. Things only got worse. Our drink orders and food orders were immediately placed since we had 20 minutes to stew over our choices. When asked if we could have two Irish coffees, it seemed like no problem. Albeit the cocktail is not on their menu, nor is this establishment anything close to a specialty coffee house, but the Irish coffee we received was pitiful. Warm coffee with a shot of well whiskey with no sugar or cream to compensate. We attempted to order the fig flatbread as an app. ""Out"". Then a request for onion soup was met with another ""out"".  Mind you this was 1pm. From there, things were looking up since we were able to place an order for the buttermilk fried chicken and the vegetarian tacos...But our anxiety ridden server made it uncomfortable for us to ask for modifications. He was running from table to table, obviously stretched too thin from what I would assume to be an understaffed team. The manager even came around to ask how everything was going. I told him our experience had been a bit rocky thus far, and he did not feel inclined to inquire about our service or express sympathy for the poor service we had endured. I would not go back and I would advise others to steer clear. Their only saving grace would have been the side of Mac and cheese but for such a small serving costing $6, it not worth the 30 minutes it takes to get to the table. Two stars for what should be a one star review for the benefit of the doubt of it being jazz fest, food being somewhat on par with their attempted image, and them covering the costs of the drinks that were horribly executed."
2 star rating,Amazing Atmosphere a good place to hang out with friends  the food is pretty good the calamari is a most but not a fan of the fish tacos (catfish) might be a wait  as all places are just hang at the bar more fun .. Enjoy..
4 star rating,"A friend recommended this restaurant for my small birthday celebration and I loved everything about this place.The scenery is fabulous, great parking and prime location for downtown Detroit. The entire staff from the host, waitress, bartenders and cooks were extremely incredible!!! They were great host to my friends and I. We even had the pleasure of meeting the owner to thank him.And did I mention they serve the best vegetarian tacos and Brunch!!!Definitely my top 5 favorite restaurant in Detroit!"
5 star rating,We had seven people in our party and didn't have to wait to be seated (Thursday evening). Our waitress was great. We have two children who are picky eaters and we didn't see much our daughter. My wife asked if we could get the flatbread with just cheese.  Our waitress (can't remember name) said she had three children at home who were picky eaters and had the kitchen make a quesadilla for her.  Very accommodating on her part.I had the carne asada tacos and my wife had the pickled beet salad with salmon.  It was all very delicious and I wouldn't hesitate to go back.
4 star rating,Felt very unwelcome by the Hostess.    Felt like we were an inconvenience by the Bartenders.   Witnessed other patrons waiting a very long time to be acknowledged by the Bartenders and being treated like they were a bother.    We did appreciate the paper straws.
1 star rating,Felt unwelcome by the hostess.  Felt like we were a bother by the bartenders.    Watched terrible service throughout the restaurant.   Love the paper straws though.
1 star rating,"Wife and I decided to try out Central Kitchen and sat at the bar to drink and eat.  Good drink selection and the Central Mule was good.   Bartender was disappointing, busy chatting with a couple regulars, and generally made us feel like a bother.  Started with the ahi tuna appetizer which was small and just OK.  Base on the service and the one appetizer, we decided to cut our losses and check out another establishment nearby instead of having more drinks and dinner at Central.  We will likely give Central another chance, but it may be awhile since there are a lot of choices in the D."
3 star rating,Place was unreal & food was fabulous and desserts are even better thank you so much Central kitchen bar and grill
5 star rating,"Two friends and I came here after being turned away from Townhouse. Boy, am I glad that happened! Chef Christina Stanco is an enormous talent. We had several appetizers/small plates and all were delicious. She's not afraid to season her dishes assertively and the food is creative, fun and tasty. Our server was super sweet, enthusiastic about the place and had great recommendations. The decor is fantastic, albeit a bit on the loud side, but it ain't no thing because the food will have you shutting your mouth in no time anyway. Looking forward to seeing if the staff can keep up this high level of food and service. Highly recommended; looking forward to trying more of the menu."
5 star rating,The oysters are phenomenal! I loved the atmosphere and decor! However our server took a long time to get to us and other employees took care of us more than she did. Even still we were well taken care of!
3.5 star rating,"This review is based on the ambience and the hostesses since that was as far as we got. Brought a group of 4 here around 7 for dinner. One of the 3 hostesses let me know it would be a 20 min wait. And that there were 2 people ahead of me, she wrote down my name and we sat down in the waiting area. The restaurant is SO LOUD. I think partly because of all the people packed into the bar area we could barely hold a conversation sitting next to each other. After 30 min of waiting my husband checked in with the hostess only to find out that she ""threw away"" the list with my name on it. My husband is the nice one, and just politely inquired as to when we would be seated. As unsettling as that was, what was more offensive was her flippant attitude about her team's mistake and getting us sat. We ended up leaving to go elsewhere. A little more professionalism would go a long way."
2 star rating,"Arrived here late one night with my husband after a long week at work on 3/4/16. Wait staff was prompt and attentive. The cocktail menu was very interesting and while feeling indecisive I asked our waiter for a recommendation. The ""Poor Little Rich Girl"" was delicious. Turkey burger was a bit heavy. I would return for drinks only at a later date if the option is there. Decor and ambiance are very cool and chill."
4 star rating,"Will never ever go again! Awful customer service! Overpriced and rip off! Server told me my drink was $9.60, I gave her a $20. She came back with $6 and said ""oops - it was actually $13.86 because you just missed happy hour"". I then gave her a $2 tip. Looked at my receipt when I got home and I see my drink was ACTUALLY $11 - and a $2.20 was already included!!! It was a house wine...definitely not worth the $16 I paid for it!!This all happened after I had to stalk their reservations person to schedule my group only for them to confirm this morning and then give my room away!!!!!!!!!!!  SERIOUSLY!!!  When I asked to speak with someone I was told a manager would come talk to me - never came!There are so so many great places to go in Detroit- skip this place!!!"
1 star rating,"Awesome location, in the heart of campus martius. We parked in Kennedy square parking structure and walked around. This restaurant was modern and had we had great service. We didn't eat, but the food around us looked incredible. Drinks were delicious and well made. Cool spot!!"
5 star rating,Great location across from Campus Martius!  Have eaten here a few times and the pork sandwich never disappoints!  My favorite item is the shrimp & grits!
4 star rating,"Super casual and relaxed atmosphere with solid options for dinner. Honestly, I wanted to give Central 4 stars, but as I sit here and write the review I really can't remember anything that truly stood out which seems like a character trait of a 3 star restaurant. The service was fine. The appetizers came out within a reasonable time. The burger was cooked to expectation. The beer was cold... Frankly, would I be happy to come here again? Absolutely. Would I plan a day around coming here? Probably not."
3 star rating,I ate their Cuban sandwich last night!Had to speed home to Sit in toilet all night!Obviously bad PORK!Nasty never will ever go back!!!!Had to pay to get sick!!!!
1 star rating,"Terrible service, long wait for clownish, cold salmon sandwich. Not worth the time: avoid."
2 star rating,"After a minor blip on the screen with some menu and happy hour changes, Central really listened to its customers and restored its status as our go to happy hour, lunch and dinner spot! Great drinks, great staff and tasty food."
4 star rating,"Central has been my go-to happy hour place for years now. A recent management shakeup, however, has led to disappointing changes. Key menu staples have been removed and the happy hour snacks and specials have been greatly truncated and relegated to the immediate bar area. All the while, prices have continued to creep up. For years the quality of the food, menu variety, and great happy hour specials and vibe won my loyalty. Unfortunately, Central is no longer the only game in town and there are just too many nearby options of commensurate quality to justify continuing to frequent Central - especially when their new strategy appears to be prioritizing profits over all else."
2 star rating,"My family and I had an excellent experience at Central kitchen. We were seated promptly and had a pleasant server whom made our night enjoyable. We ordered a variety of meals including the burger, shrimp and grits, and the nightly special and each one was fantastic, couldn't choose my favorite. This place has a great atmosphere and is reasonably priced, worth a try!"
3.5 star rating,"Cute, cute.Loving this lil gem. Nice vibes, cute crowd. Good burger. Gorgeous waiters, with bangin clothes and attitudes to boot. Everyone is happy here.Food's good. Fried cheese crumbles should be endless. The burger is good enough (I was born in TX, and beef is king there. Takes much to impress a Texan.). Overall, I'll come here next time I'm in Detroit for biz--probably with clients, too.Bottom line: if you want to eat amid the fabulous Art Deco and Neo-Gothic magnificence of the early success of one of the most important cities in the world, Central is a great choice. If you wish to avoid ""ruin Porn"" and sit across from the world headquarters of QuickenLoans and cleaned up elegance, eat here. Good, kind, cute, sweet, nice drink options, etc. Stamping approval."
4 star rating,The fries are sooooo good.  Restaurant has a nice vibe.   The service and food are always good.   Only complaint is it is so noisy!    Very hard to hold a conversation
4 star rating,"Underwhelming. Food was just ok. Nothing to write home about. Wouldn't go back. Also, not very gluten free friendly or helpful to figure out what was GF."
2 star rating,"I enjoyed this place a lot.  It's in a great location and the atmosphere inside is awesome - very inviting and trendy.  With that being said I have only sat in the covered patio and never inside the restaurant's main dining area, which actually seems to be a bit quieter.   I have really enjoyed the food I have eaten here and still want to come back to try other things on their menu.  For appetizers I have had the wings, fried cheese curds, and carnitas nachos.  I love both the cheese curds and nachos and I would recommend them.  As for my entrée, I had the Steak Frits, which were cooked perfectly and seasoned well.  It comes with fries, but I subbed for the goat cheese fingerling potatoes which were to die for.  Ended dinner with a Nutella Brownie, which was great as well.  I will definitely be back as there are many other things I would like to try on the menu and it's a nice place to get a drink as well."
4 star rating,"Awesome food and great service made for a wonderful experience! My friend and I tried the fish tacos, pei mussels, and the cauliflower salad. All were absolutely delicious! Would forsure go back!"

4 star rating,"At my ""Reminisce spot"" The atmosphere always brings me back. Absorbing a little alternative and an El Chapo. Winding down with a plate of Tender Wings; celery crisp and a selection of sauces. The crowd is pouring in.....trendy ambiance. Enjoyable for after work."
5 star rating,"So this place wasn't bad, just not worth the cost. Ambiance--trendy but not too bougie. Surprisingly small location tho. Service was decent. The drinks were most definitely the best part --I'm not give a whiskey person but the Day for Remembrance was delicious and probably the best drink. Hot in the city was the jalapeño tequila drink and was quite spicy. Food was all just okay--calamari was pretty good but the entrees were just average, nothing to get too excited about. I had the trout, also tried the steak and salmon. Again all decent. Overall would come back for a few drinks and apps, but not necessarily for dinner. Also better for smaller groups."
3 star rating,Great food and service. Recommend the French onion soup and fried chicken sandwich. Had an issue with the steak taco. Steak was not tasty.
4 star rating,"Ok call me crazy but I returned for a second try today for lunch and ordered the chicken sandwich and added fries this time.  The chicken was on the dry side, and fries were undesirable, not cooked all the way through.  Nothing fancy, no herb seasonings or anything to justify the added 3.50 they charge for fries.  Since 3 weeks ago the price for the chicken sandwich increased from 11.50 to $12.  I just can't believe I paid 16.00 for a chicken sandwich and some fries.  I definitely will not be returning.  The only nice thing I can say is the hostess  was very personable and friendly.  The quality of the food does not match the prices."
1 star rating,"Stopped by for lunch last Thursday and ordered a carry out -chicken sandwich for a whopping 11.50 no fries or soup came with the sandwich, no extra anything.  The sandwich was tasty, but it reminded me of a Wendy's chicken sandwich.  Nothing fancy or extra ordinary.  I will try again and dine inside!"
3.5 star rating,Worst service ever. Had a call ahead for 7:30 and they sat me at 9!!!!!!!! I understand the time is  not guaranteed but they wouldn't even update us!!! It's such a shame because the food is great. Won't be back.
1 star rating,Really enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  Staff was amazing and accommodating for a walk in group that started at 6 and grew to 10.  Food and drinks were excellent. Industrial and historic mix for decor.  Great our lounge areas.
5 star rating,We had a late lunch last Saturday at Central and it was really delicious with sophisticated flavors and a killer atmosphere! It is the perfect spot for date night or drinks with friends!
5 star rating,"Awesome atmosphere, great food. Turkey burger was juicy and tender. Sit outside to enjoy the new downtown view"
4 star rating,This place is elegant and cool. It's the perfect place to eat in the city and truly feel like you're eating clean good food
5 star rating,"The food is AMAZING! Been here multiple times and it was always SO good and fresh! Brunch here is also tasty. They are always super busy, so sometimes it's hard to get a place to sit, but despite that the service is always pretty great. MUST TRY THE CALAMARI! LOVE!!"
5 star rating,"Went here on Valentine's Day before a concert. My date and I sat at the bar to avoid an hour wait time to be seated. The first two things I picked out to eat on the menu they didn't have. That was a little irritating. By my third choice I finally picked out an entree that was on their menu they actually had lol. The food was okay.  The drinks were strong which is a plus for me. I hate expensive watered down liquor. The ambience is okay, it's one of those trendy spots. I will go back again. Owners and bartenders were kool."
4 star rating,Excellent!  They've done a creative job on the space and the food is great as well. Luckily we were able to get a table outside because the weather was beautiful and downtown was busy.  We started with a couple of cocktails and both were well made.  We then had the calamari which is outstanding.  I always swear by the calamari at Union Street and Grille Midtown but Central Kitchen may actually beat them both.  We then had the Detroit Burger and a prosciutto flatbread.  The burger was also amazing.  One of the best I've had.  The flatbread was good but nothing memorable so probably wouldn't get that next time.  The service was spot on everyone working there was very friendly.  We will definitely be going back.  I wasn't sure if I should rate it as a four or five stars but ultimately gave it five because it just opened and everything was flawless.
5 star rating,"These stars are 90% for their chicken sandwich. Just the chicken sandwich. the burgers are disappointing in their flavor and consistency, but its like all the hate someone puts into the burgers is replaced with love in the buttermilk chicken sandwich. I have people at my office thanking me for the recommendation on the sandwich alone, even though they had also been disappointed with the establishment on other dishes previously. its a really nice place, and they are still growing but this simple and usually completely disregarded dish will keep me coming back probably twice a week unless something changes.   Im writing this review on such a simple dish because its unlikely i'll try anything else from here, and that is the reason I posted this review. I've STARTED multiple conversation about a chicken sandwich, it deserves 5 stars."
5 star rating,"Great for any aspiring bartender or line cook who doesn't know what they are doing. If you're too lazy to dump Gordon Food Service quality on a plate yourself, or haphazardly mix booze in a glass, then pay a nice premium to have these great folks do it!"
3.5 star rating,Wow!  We love muscles and I must say these are the BEST we have had around town!  The prices were on point and the service was genuine!  The plate presentation was delicious!  Everything about this place I would recommend to everyone!  I can't wait to go back!!!  So glad we stumbled upon your place!
5 star rating,"Stopped in with 2 other friends... The restaurant is visually pleasing..the only issue is it was very loud, very hard to hold a conversation even sitting at a booth... The food was amazing, small portions tho... Our waitress was very friendly and attentive... I would recommend for sure and I will defiantly be back again!"
4 star rating,Wow. Delicious food. The service was fast and the atmosphere was nice. Pretty classy but we went in sweatshirts and didn't feel too out of place. Got the pork nachos and burgers. Both excellent. We will go again.
5 star rating,"Tried on a recent Saturday night and was surprised at how busy it was just after New Years. I guess I thought everyone would be broke or burned out by the holidays - but not so, the place was jammed. We were told we'd have a 30 minute wait which was only about a 15 minute wait, so not bad. We were put at a 2 person hightop table, near the front of the restaurant across from the bar, it was comfortable if a bit congested. Every time our waitress stopped to take our order, refill drinks, etc., it did cause a bottleneck which meant she was squishing into our table. I liked the menu selections and settled on the duck confit flatbread and the wild mushroom soup. I really liked both of them and thought the price for the flatbread was really reasonable ($11). It had large chunks of duck on it that were tender and delicious. The soup was equally tasty. The only glitch was the waitress asked if I wanted my soup first, I said yes, then she proceeded to bring both items together (and didn't acknowledge the oops).  My bf got the Carnitas tacos, and said they were really good - again at $12, not too bad. I liked the decor and the atmosphere, good location, I'll be back.The good/bad - they have a dj who fired up his music about half way through our meal. A speaker was hanging over our table - we could no longer converse and the music was deafening. We flagged down our waitress and asked her if they could turn down the volume a bit. To our surprise they did, it appears they can control the speakers individually. So while it was still pretty loud in there, and we did have to raise our voices to converse, it was better. So points for trying to fix the problem. I still don't understand the trend though to super noisy restaurant acoustics, I go out to dinner to enjoy my meal and converse. Not sit silently staring at my date or yelling to be heard. Hopefully this trend will backfire soon and restaurants will go back to a civilized volume."
4 star rating,"Just a quick stop for lunch today, I was very surprised at how good it was! Atmosphere is good, service was smooth and food was delicious! Had some catfish tacos that totally rocked! I'll be back for 2nds!"
5 star rating,"Eh.  I was enticed by the website and some friends experiences.  We went on a saturday around 5 pm.  The atmosphere is okay, its pretty hodgepodge designs honestly.Food:  EVERYTHING SALTY.I mean super salty.Like, fill up my cup of water quicker salty.The calamari was served in nice presentation but was salty. My wife had the mussels which were okay but not special.I had the fried chicken sandwich which was dry with a crumbly bun.Overall, a lot of hype but didn't deliver.  Certainly worth a try once or twice but not a regular place to go."
2 star rating,"I don't think there was valet - or at least it wasn't very apparent - but a public lot just down the street (maybe a 60-second walk) made that annoyance nearly null. The atmosphere is amazing. Very light and airy. The seating options are plentiful (cozy two tops at the bar to large 6-people booths in the dining room). A TV in the bar with the red wings game on kept some members of our party happy. Didn't get a chance to dine in the heated patio area but it looked awesome, especially if you're sharing food with friends and don't necessarily need a formal table to sit. The calamari appetizer was recommended by our waiter Norris... And, boy, was he right! Different than normal calamari but incredible. Very lightly breaded. Not too heavy. We also got the BBQ wings and mussels to start. Both were gone quite quickly! Main courses were equally as well received (the Cuban, the burger, Ahi tuna salad, prosciutto flatbread)."
4 star rating,"I had a good experience both times that I have been. Service and food were good. I recommend trying out this spot, if you haven't already."
4 star rating,"I've been here a few times now for weekday lunches. The food is pretty good (worth the price tag), and you're usually seated right away. I was here last Friday, with some coworkers, and everyone loved their food (we had flatbreads, mussels, burgers, and tacos).  So, why only 3 stars? Because the service is super slow. While the food didn't take too long to bring out, closing out and getting our checks took about 30 minutes. All of the tables in our section seemed to falling prey to the same problem, so perhaps there was an issue with connectivity? In any case, I hope this isn't a recurring issue, but maybe Friday lunch-rush issue. Fingers crossed!"
3 star rating,"Central Kitchen is a perfect spot to meet after work. I'm giving it only 4 stars right now because I didn't actually eat anything, just had a few drinks. As per most happy hours they have drink and food specials, but I love the look and feel of the place. It's smaller than I expected, so I'm sure the wait time will be ridiculous on most non early days. The bartender was awesome though. Very personable and friendly.So for now it gets a good review on aesthetics and reasonably priced happy hour and a very cool bartender. Can't wait to try their menu."
3.5 star rating,Wow. Delicious food. The service was fast and the atmosphere was nice. Pretty classy but we went in sweatshirts and didn't feel too out of place. Got the pork nachos and burgers. Both excellent. We will go again.

4 star rating,"My husband and I were excited to get out of the house and enjoy date night after a long week and being new parents. We were placed at a high top in the bar area which we were more than fine with until a group event started spilling out of the private room surrounding our table. We couldn't hear each other talk. Again, would have been fine if we were here for appetizers and drinks but we were spending a good amount of money for a nice dinner. The fact that people were so close to our table we had to move our food so a women's hair wouldn't get in it-my husband went and asked if we could be moved. There were plenty of open tables and booths with no wait up front. The hostess said we could not move since we placed our food order already. Our food came, my husbands steak was raw and had to be sent back. My food was good and our waiter who could only get back to us twice since it was so crowded was nice and knew we were upset but that was really the only saving grace of this place. It's a shame as my husband and I work at a company downtown and would have liked to rave about this place. We won't be coming back."
1 star rating,Great food and service. Recommend the French onion soup and fried chicken sandwich. Had an issue with the steak taco. Steak was not tasty.
4 star rating,"Decided to have lunch here as we were meeting a few people for the Holiday Market. Was able to do call ahead seating which was great. Our service was absolutely terrible: did not bring enough waters for everyone in our group, slow on refills and to take our order. The runner who brought out our food was VERY rude as she slammed the plates of food down in the middle of the table, rattled off what each plate was (not caring if they were going to the correct person who ordered them) and running off before asking if we needed anything else (we did need silverware since somehow they couldn't manage to give that to us initially). Food was just OK. I had seen on the menu online you could make your own salad but apparently they are ""brunch only"" on Sundays with a very limited menu which was disappointing. Also, the one bathroom in the restaurant was ""shut down for maintenance"" so we had to use the bathroom at the hotel that is connected to the restaurant. Overall, a lot of inconveniences. was not impressed, I don't recommend and we will not be back."
2 star rating,Best Sunday Bruch and bottomless mimosa's in town !
5 star rating,Called ahead at 7:15 for 8pm table for 4 on a Saturday (tonight).  Arrived at 8 and told 25 minute wait.  Waited 1:20 and checked in with hostess 3 times.  Finally gave up
1 star rating,Laid back atmosphere. Very casual.  Nice location. Food was good. Service was great. I ordered the wings and fries but it looked like everybody in the place was ordering burgers or the tacos. Prices not bad considering its in the downtown area. Parking sucks!
4 star rating,"This is a great place to grab lunch if you are downtown Detroit.  The waitstaff is super friendly and happy to make recommendations about the menu.  I had the cauliflower salad with blackened salmon based on our waitress' recommendation.  It was fabulous.  The french fries here are very tasty as well. Note, they do no take recommendations and when we arrived at 12:30 p.m for lunch, we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table."
4 star rating,"Omg. I cannot begin to say how much I love this restaurant!  First time here and I will be back. First off love the location. Second  the place is cute.  Third kaylee our waitress is awesome. She offered. Her recommendations, we took her advise and I am were not disappointed. The Detroit burger, wonderful. French fries, seasoned thin cut would order again. Oh, also we split the Green chili- be sure sure to add pork...yummy!"
3.5 star rating,"I'll start with the good: bartender was very friendly and attentive, decor is very well done (although it could use fewer TVs), and ambience was pleasantly busy on a Tuesday night.  Where it got thoroughly meh for me was the food.  My turkey burger was good enough, but certainly not great, served on a whole lotta bun that wasn't really worth eating.  For $11, it would be nice if it at least came with some fries or something, but nope:  just a big plate with a pickle.  Instead you have to order a $3.50 side order of fries, which is far too big a portion for one person.  Fine if you're splitting it with one or two people, not cool if you just want a few fries with your burger.  On the plus side, the aioli they serve with the fries is delicious.  The fries themselves were a little greasy.  I'd come back to try a salad or something off the menu if friends wanted to meet there, but I wouldn't seek it out again other than that."
3 star rating,"This place was just OK. Like other reviewers have said, the cheese curds and calamari are very good.  Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. I had the mahi mahi special and I had to send it back, the first time I've ever done that. I felt bad, but the sauce tasted like Campbell's soup mixed with orange juice from concentrate. I then had a Caesar salad with salmon, which was average. The people I was with had the ahi tuna salad, which was pretty good. It's visually a nice place, but there are better food options downtown."
3 star rating,"Best food ever!  I had shrimp and grits and it was the best I've ever had.  my daughter reluctantly shared her fries, which were amazing!  Our server said that the spice mix used in the sauce that came with the fries is sold somewhere downtown.  Please, please, please will you name the source?  I've looked everywhere to no avail.  We will definitely be back (and back and back and back).  ;)"
5 star rating,"Had the worst table in the place right behind a huge concrete pillar. No view of anything and in the path of everyone coming through to the patio and larger dining area. The prices are great $10ish and the food low priced too. The $9 buttermilk fried chicken sandwich was filling but really bland. The fries were too salty but super hot when delivered to the table. Service is attentive and good. The burger got a good review but I didn't try it myself. I'll be back to try the roasted cauliflower salad and the tacos. Stay tuned. Townhouse has the better larger venue but Central Kitchen just feels better, less stuffy and more welcoming."
3 star rating,Stopped in for lunch this past week and was really impressed! The service was surprisingly great. Our food took almost 40 minutes but I chalk that up to being new and having some opening pains. I had the Cuban which was really good. I didn't get a drink but their drink menu looked great. I'll definitely be back and not just because it's located in the building that I work in.
4 star rating,"The service here is great! Ashley, our server was Amazing. The only thing that prevents us from going here regularly are the prices. I ordered 1 drink and an appetizer during happy hour. My bill was $30! They have these amazing cheese curds, and you can only order them at the bar! Unfortunately I was with a party of 10 and the bar has Very limited seating. Will I go back? Of course.. will I make it a regular stop after work, probably not."
3 star rating,"Central Kitchen + Bar was an incredible experience! Ashley was an amazing bartender (with very strong drinks) for a reasonable price. We had the steak tacos, chicken sandwich, and burger but BY FAR the burger was the best! Our waitress Nicole was hilarious and fun! Atmosphere is family friendly and chic. We will be back :)"
5 star rating,"Good food well prepared.  A varied menu from Lamb chops, Ahi Tuna, to burgers from vegan to beef.  Interesting atmosphere, and great staff.  One owner was meeting, greeting, and making sure we were all well served. Note: located facing Cadillac Square despite Woodward address.  You can see the compuware building from front."
5 star rating,"Very good! We split the chorizo tacos we're great! We also split the croque Madame. Sandwich was good, if you don't care for runny eggs (like myself) I'd suggest having the egg over medium. But, over all it was a great place to get brunch!"
3 star rating,Love the atmosphere. Appetizers were good. Tacos were amazing. Staff was friendly and my waitress was great. Will be back here very soon. Nice look to the place made me feel like I was out of town
3.5 star rating,"Nice ambience. Went here last night and it was pretty crowded. However, we called ahead and there was only a 15 minute wait to get a table. They ran out of chicken so we couldn't order chicken. Ran out of certain cocktails and the nutella brownie for dessert wasn't available. That was disappointing to hear. The waitress was in a hurry to get us out which we found rude. She kept coming by to clear the table and asked several times if we were ready for boxes. Didn't offer dessert menu, instead brought us the bill. We had to ask about the dessert menu. My friend was pregnant and I couldn't believe the waitress tried to rush her to eat her meal. There wasn't even a wait at the door for her to behave this way. We were going to tip 20% but her attitude towards us was rude. She was rolling her eyes and didn't seem to want to wait on us. For dinner I had a the chick pea burger and fries. Fries were salted down too much. Chick pea burger was dry. My boyfriend tried the burger which he stated was good. The salad with salmon was good. I liked the twist to calamari. It was mixed with what seemed to appear like Asian sweet sauce. On the bright side we were sitting next to the mayor of Detroit. The outdoor patio looked nice. The hall next to the restaurant is remodeled and looks great. It's right next to campus martius so it's a good place to go sit or walk around. Detroit is definitely making a come back. I would go back but ask not to have that rude waitress just to try different things on the menu. Hopefully, they don't keep running out of food and can accommodate to a bigger volume of customers!"
3 star rating,Love the big windows that open to the outdoors and the patio is a plus! Good drinks and relatively small menu (which I like). Not too hungry tonight but thoroughly enjoyed the fig flatbread. A good light summer seasonal dish. I'll be back to eat this burger they say they will be known for!
4 star rating,"Best lunch experience in long time, Kaylee's recommendations were right on.  Came here business it was recommended.  Loved it & will come back.  Detroit burger was to die for, green chili the best"
5 star rating,I think Central Kitchen needs to realize they are not the only restaurant in town and learn how to treat their regular patrons with better service.  Their weekend hostess can also use an attitude adjustment.  This treatment must be consistent for blacks given another persons comments.  I will not be frequenting Central Kitchen again.
1 star rating,Atmosphere was fun. Food was mediocre. The drinks were ok. The fried cheese curds was the best thing we had.
3 star rating,"Detroit has one of the best up and coming food scenes in the country, and this place is one of the reasons why. Came here for dinner for a bachelor party. Service was excellent, food was phenomenal, atmosphere rivals any place in manhattan, and the drinks were superb! 5 stars."
5 star rating,"Ordered the otto farms chicken which was amazing. Great plate display amd taste. Only ""negative"" was our appetizer of cheese curds. It was just mozzarella sticks, not the Minnestoa-style that we were expecting. Overall great vibe, great service. Highly recommend this for casual lunch or dinner."
4 star rating,"Great trendy location downtown. Pretty good drinks, decent food, but what keeps me coming back is the decor! It's a beautiful atmosphere onlooking campus martius!"
4 star rating,"I NEVER write reviews. If you're a vegan like I am, there aren't a lot of options on the menu, but I ordered the barley mushroom burger. DELICIOUS. I will definitely order this again. The flavor was something I can't describe, but my taste buds were happy. I guess I can't ask for the recipe, huh?"
5 star rating,The fries are sooooo good.  Restaurant has a nice vibe.   The service and food are always good.   Only complaint is it is so noisy!    Very hard to hold a conversation
3.5 star rating,"This restaurant was very ""take it, or leave it."" My boyfriend and I went for dinner during Jazz Fest and to start off, we couldn't find the entrance they were directing people to. We finally found it, got out IDs check, prior to entering (we were there for dinner) but if you are planning to drink, you must get a wristband ahead of time. When we entered the restaurant, we were seated to three different tables, that were already sat. The hostess was very confused about what was going on. Finally, we were seated at our table and our waitress whispered the entire time - in a loud restaurant, mind you. We contemplated appetizers and finally selected the sausage tasting, just to be told that they were out of it. I wish she had mentioned that prior, because at this point, we skipped ordering an appetizer all together. I ordered the roasted cauliflower salad and a turkey burger sans bun. They were so-so. The presentation was boring and everything was fine, but just that - fine. You could give it a try - the flat-breads looked really good, but I doubt I'll be back with so many restaurants opening downtown."
2 star rating,We went for lunch - waiting 40 minutes and decided to leave - no food! The waitress was not apologetic. The kitchen was a complete disaster. DETROIT!!!! WAKE UP! This is not the first eatery downtown to have issues and not respect peoples time at lunch. If I had two hours to kill at lunch then I could eat anywhere downtown. If Detroit wants to be considered a legitimate big city - they restaurant managers and owners need to wake up and step up their game. They would not even be a contender in a Chicago or NYC - the restaurant couldn't survive if run this poorly.
1 star rating,"Great for any aspiring bartender or line cook who doesn't know what they are doing. If you're too lazy to dump Gordon Food Service quality on a plate yourself, or haphazardly mix booze in a glass, then pay a nice premium to have these great folks do it!"
2 star rating,"First time here. The staff is great. Friendly, professional and go out of their way to be welcoming.  Great atmosphere.  I gave fewer stars only because of my disappointment in the vegetarian chick pea burger. It had good flavor but was dry and the bun was way too thick and dry, too.  It was $10 and only included a small pickle.  (The pickles are made in-house and are great! Wish I had more of that!)  I didn't mind the price if the burger was good. It just wasn't. The seasoned fries were good but not seasoned much.  My friend loved her salad so I will go back and get a salad and flat bread next time.  I would suggest they nix the chickpea burger and go with a portbella or black bean vegetarian option, instead.  The food did look beautiful and I look forward to going back and trying something else."
3 star rating,Absolutely love this new addition to downtown. The food is amazing and the cocktails are even better.
5 star rating,"Nice ambiance, thought we would grab a drink after the Jazz Festival. Were halted at the door to get wristband to prove we were of drinking age (tacky). When I went to the restroom, was ushered into hallway restroom by a rude hostess, only to be locked out of the restaurant and have to get past wristband man again. Red headed tattooed bartender was rude and bitchy. Blonde bartender stood back there like a deer in headlights instead of helping. Calamari was saving grace-fun Asian twist on it. Go for 5 stars DAJr!!!!"
3 star rating,"Terrible host experience.  Way overestimated wait time, said 30 mins,  came back 15 minutes later and said they called our name a long time ago.  Had to wait again,  and they had an attitude. . 30 $ steak and fries are good but so overpriced it's terrible. Should cost half that.  It was a baby handful of fries and a overcooked steak.  Place is soo busy it is impressive.  Doubt it will be around long among so many new fancy terrible places that keep popping up.  Sad cause it another disappointment of the many new bad restaurants detroit is getting."
1 star rating,"Great place in Campus Martias to meet for lunch. Exceptional location, ambiance, staff and food. Located in the First National Building, I've been here 3 times since the doors opened, and every time I've been impressed. Layout is great with a full service bar, outdoor patio and garage doors which open up on nice weather days. I enjoyed the Baby Kale salad and added a piece of grilled salmon. Clean, fresh, and healthy. Enjoy!"
5 star rating,"Since this place opened I have been by a few times and have wanted to try it. I finally was able to last night. We came around happy hour time and it was filled with people post work with drinks in their hand, we felt a little underdressed.The whole setup of the restaurant is more built for a happy hour, with the bar being the centerpiece of the restaurant and the tables surrounding it. They do have some really comfy couches outside to eat at with a covered patio which I'm definitely doing if I ever get a drink here.We were seated immediately and the waitress was there in a flash to take our order. The service here was phenomenal given how many people were there. My girlfriend ordered the carnitas tacos which came with chips and salsa. I attempted to order the turkey burger, which the waitress informed me that they were out of turkey burgers. At 5 pm. Really? I instead tried the salmon sandwich. Bad decision. The sandwich was essentially cold salmon out of a can (flaked) on a bun with some pieces of small lettuce on top. No sauce or anything. The carnitas tacos stole the show, as they were tasty and a bigger portion than my sandwich. The chips however were overcooked and chewy. The salsa was a bit to tangy and not spicy enough. I sound like a snob, but if you had the dish I did, you would be too.The prices are a bit steep for the portion that you get. 12 bucks for a sandwich with no side is high by Detroit standards. The cocktails are 10-12 dollars which is high unless you're a very fancy place around here (ie sugar house).Overall: amazing place for a happy hour, not so great for dinner but had great service. I'll be back for a drink only."
3 star rating,"Came in here for lunch with a friend during work, the hostess passed us by and asked the couple behind us where they wanted to sit.  That was so rude she ignored us completely.  We then had to flag a girl down to get a seat.  We were seated at a 2 top in the bar.  We had some house white and edamame beans which were very tasty.  The beans have a nice tasty sauce to dip into.  I got the salmon sandwich for lunch, not good at all.  The bun was hard and dry, the salmon was mashed with mayo and maple.  It was so sweet I could not eat it and the bun was near impossible to chew without adding water to it.  I flagged down my waitress and ordered something new the fig flat bread.  The flat bread took 45 min to come out! The flavor was just ok.  My friend had already finished her food by the time mine came out, at least she poured a full glass of wine.   I would say this place is good for snacks and drinks but nothing more.  Also be prepared to get overlooked and the food to take forever to get to you."
3.5 star rating,Awesome awesome! Great service Jessica and the host were so pleasant. The food was dynamite . I made my friend try the mussels and they were unbelievable! You have to try this place
5 star rating,Went on a Saturday afternoon and were seated promptly. We had a lovely vibrant waitress who had great suggestions. I had the beet ravioli and scallops and it was truly one of the best dishes I've ever had. Truly satisfying and such a wonderful flavor combination.
5 star rating,"Loved loved loved! Great cocktails, great fries ( huge connissiour), and scrumptious cauliflower salad!!! One star down for a shady bitchy half-a$$ed waitress! Will definitely go back and try more! Cute decor and atmosphere with endearing Christmas lights by the kitchen. Why? Not sure, but still cute."
4 star rating,"Great Aura, great food, friendly service.... We indulged in the hush puppies, Detroiter burger, and the ahi tuna salad... Everything was delicious! I will most definently be back to try some different menu options!"
5 star rating,"Average burgers.  What's worse is that we were seated at a table under a leaking pipe.  We were leaked on!  We mentioned to the server who said ""yeah, we can't do anything about that"".  Um yes you can....don't seat people under there!  Or maybe give complimentary something when someone complains instead of shrug shoulders?"
1 star rating,"Recently went here for a girl's night. A late dinner and cocktails. Great service, great food. SUPER cute. I had the Cuban sandwich and the refresher course. Both excellent. They could expand their cocktail menu a bit."
5 star rating,"Went to Central on Saturday around 3:30pm. Walked in to a half empty restaurant with the completely unorganized staff walking by and not acknowledging anyone at the door. I was finally greeted by a completely rude and unprofessional hostess who was claiming that I had to wait for my other party in order to be sat - bullshit. I was finally sat at the worst table in the restaurant (next to the kitchen) while there were SEVERAL open tables, booths, etc available. After asking our waitress if we could be moved to the booth near the window and away from the filthy kitchen line, we were told that the booths were for parties of 4 - again, the restaurant was empty. Food was good, service was decent, drinks were boring.  I wouldn't waste my time going back, nor would I recommend this restaurant to anyone. Central needs to tone down their ego and take a class in professionalism."
2 star rating,"Stopped by after the auto show around 3pm. There were a handful of people eating so we were seated right away. The decor was bohemian chic and looked like it used recycled materials. Our waitress was friendly and sweet. She suggested the veggie tacos which I went with. They were tasty but a bit on the salty side. We also got a side of fries with my partner's burger. (The Detroit burger - which he loved, but also thought it was pretty salty) The fries were a little cold but the dip that came with it was delicious. I imagine if we came at a more popular time the fries would have been hot. I also asked to try a side of fried pickles that came on one of the burgers. They were cold and soggy and also they're not meant to be eaten by themselves, but that's what they were. It was tasty and I'm glad to have experienced it, but it probably wouldn't be my top pick to go back to."
4 star rating,"The restaurant is hip/trendy and centrally located.  Great atmosphere, service, and terrific food options.  I was with a group of 5 and we all ordered something different and everyone raved about their orders.  Central Kitchen is great for after work drinks and or a great meet up with friends.  Highly recommended... this is my new go to spot!!!"

3.5 star rating,"We went to Central the week it opened. The food was pretty good (once they got our order correct). The service, however, was quite disappointing. I ordered the turkey burger, without avocado, since I have an allergy. The server said she wrote that down but when she delivered the food, there was avocado on my burger. This was a terrible inconvenience for her. So, my husband ate his sandwich while I sat there waiting for another burger to be made. Luckily, we did order a side of mac and cheese, which was mediocre, so I was able to munch on that. No one ever came over (manager, etc) to ask how our meal was going. That's usually a pretty common thing during an opening week, at least it has been in my experience. We will give this place another shot but if things go the way they did previously, it will be our last visit."

3 star rating,"Very impressed. They just opened, and food was great. Truffle Parmesan wings were perfectly crispy. My girlfriend and I split the central burger, Cuban and Mac and cheese. I would go back and order any of these again.  They were all very tasty. Great new addition to Detroit. Will definitely seek this place out again."
5 star rating,"Came to Central looking for a new spot to grab some food and drinks, took 15 for two of us to get a table, was waited on while we waited by Keith and then he ended up being our server as well. Service was great, drinks were stiff. Got the chicken sandwich, really tasty, my friend got the Detroit burger, he said the zip sauce was good and made the burger. Will definitely be back. Keith was a great server!"
5 star rating,I celebrated my birthday  there in September the ambiance was great and the food was awesome.
5 star rating,"I had their salad with chicken.  It was a really good salad.  However, the noise in there is horribly loud. I could not hear my friend that I was dining with 1/2 the time.   You are soooo close the folks next to you eating.  They really cram you in there.  It was like was were all sharing the same conversation because we were so close.  Since I don't like to eat in places that are as loud as bars at midnight, this is not the place for me.  I am giving it 2 stars only because the salad was so good."

1 star rating,"I enjoyed this place for lunch!! Had the edamame app and it came with this sweet, tangy sauce which was to die for! The kale salad was light, tasty and filling! The house Sav-blanc was just right! Yay! I will re-visit this place for sure!"
5 star rating,"I went for lunch with co-workers.  Nice decor and ambience and the staff was friendly and helpful.  Definitely a good addition to the Detroit dining scene.  My colleagues ordered the Cuban (really good) and the Turkey Burger (OK).  We shared a basket of fries, which come with a dipping sauce.  They were fantastic and a deal at $3.50.  I ordered the Kale Salad, and added shrimp for a $6 surcharge.  What came were 2 (yes, TWO) shrimp!  If they had been jumbo or even large, I wouldn't say anything, but these were medium at best.  I thought perhaps the kitchen had made a mistake, but when we got the bill, it was spelled out right on there - 2 shrimp at $3 each.  Really?  If you're going to be that skimpy, don't even put it on the menu.  It only irritates your guests.  I will definitely be back, but will probably steer clear of the salads."
4 star rating,"Great food, good service and a nice patio. Need I say more?"
3.5 star rating,There is no doubt the food is good. We had central burger and the roasted cauliflower salad. Burger was ordered medium. I usually douse mine with ketchup but this burger was so flavorful that I didn't need to. My wife loved the salad and so did I. We had the mac and cheese for the side which was served with a broken handle pan. I wouldn't served my guest at home with a broken dish and  a restaurant shouldn't either. I ordered a side of fries that never came but i didnt remind jackie our server because we were full already. I should have checked my bill if they charged me for it but forgot. I only gave the restaurant 3 stars despite of the really good food is the service. Although our food came out in good time. They kinda forgot about us after getting seated. I had to call the receptionist attention cuz there were no server to greet us or to take our order or even simply introduced themselves as our server. Very bad first impression. And the whole place was less than half full.(it was 4pm no excuses). What if we came in at a busy time?  We ended up walking to townhouse which was a block away and what a stark contrast. Immediate attention once we were seated down. What a waste of a good location.
3 star rating,"Excited to be visiting another new restaurant which has opened in the Downtown area.  Went there for lunch today and what a poor experience with the Manager.  Ordered the soup of the day which was very good and the wings appetizer with french fries.  Bit into a Wing and saw that they were not completely done.  Talked to the waitress and she took them back and also wanted to take back the one that I had bitten into to show the cook, A few minutes later a lady came out, who I found out was the Manager, and said that the cook and another person had looked at them and said they were cooked well, however, they would cook another order and cook them longer.  What poor Customer service !!! After lunch, I asked the waitress to see the Manager.  I told her that I didn't think she handled my complaint very well, she said to me, Well I didn't mean to hurt your feelings !!!!!  I told her, you didn't hurt my feelings that this was poor customer service to tell me about folks looking at the wings and saying they were ok, which they weren't to me.I also told her that if I did not tell her, she would have no way of knowing.  Won't be going back.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of the Waitress who was Excellent !!!!"
