2/20/2022,4 star rating,"Haven't been since 2019 and I wasn't disappointed with my drinks and food. The decor is dated but the vibe is great. DJ played good music, there are two sides and two bars to order from. It was a mixed crowd as far as age range as well. I'll be back"
4/10/2022,1 star rating,"I am highly disappointed with this establishment. On Opening Day for the Detroit Tigers... I paid $20 to valet and a $40 cover charge PER PERSON to enter Flood's. The male bartender was drunk. I ordered with him 3 different times and he still did not make my drink. He kept telling everyone waiting at the bar, ""I got you, I got you"", promising to make their orders but instead, just stumbled around the bar, texting on his phone. It took me 45 minutes, standing directly bracing on the bar to be served. Another bartender made my order. How can you know that Opening Day in Detroit is a big deal, charge that hefty cover charge and then not staff the bar? Why would you charge your patrons $40 for such an establishment? The tent on the side was the most filthiest thing I've ever seen. The floors had straight up trash upon entering. Inside, behind the bar was atrocious. Glasses were piled up, not being washed and what appeared like wet paper towels/napkins on the floor. **I am choosing to not post the pictures I took as I don't want them associated with my profile** Come on black owned businesses,  we need to do better. Why do we allow such mediocrity?I write this review with a heavy heart. I've been here before when I first moved to MI 6yrs ago. I started noticing a decline so I stopped going. Had some friends fly in from California for Opening Day and suggested we meet up here.  I warned them!! I will not return and I donot recommend."
5/30/2021,5 star rating,Currently here now for brunch and everything is still delicious as it was before the pandemic. I have the shrimp and chicken combo with Mac and cheese and yams. Oh yeah there's cornbread here also. So delicious . lol I had already eaten one piece of chicken from the pic

7/19/2020,4 star rating,"Floods is popular go to spot for black Detroiters. I've been coming here for years.I've always had a positive experience. The food is okay. I had chicken and shrimp with a side of green beans and Mac n cheese. My food came out pippin hot! The Mac was a little salty. The green beans were canned, I didn't like them and didn't finish them either. On a positive note, they make the green beans with turkey meat instead of pork, fyi. I enjoyed the jumbo shrimp the most.They usually have live music up front and a dj in the back.I got to enjoy patio seating this visit where they played music on a speaker.I like this place so I'll be back."
7/14/2021,3 star rating,I decided to give this restaurant another chance after visiting a few years ago and was greatly disappointed for the second time. I went to this restaurant on Sunday because I heard it was an old school crowd.  Currently I'm visiting Detroit and wanted to try to support a black business.   I checked the Instagram and website prior to arriving to ensure I was aware of cost during Covid-19.  Per the website and social media there is no cover charge until 8 pm. I arrived at 530p and they charged $10.  Then when I got inside I waited for fifteen to twenty minutes waiting on a server.   I had to go to the bar to request assistance as two waitresses passed me twice and never acknowledged or asked if needed anything.  Once I received a waitress she was nice but busy.  It was a noticeable amount of time between visits. My friend had never been and I felt bad about the service as I was hoping for a better experience. The shrimp is delish and the serve was disappointing.   I'm just at a loss of words....
12/6/2017,3 star rating,Decided to pop in since I heard nothing but good things about this spot. Not my favorite. I dropped in on a Sunday evening and there were a lot of young adults I'd say under 25 yes old.  The valet was behind I parking cars since the place isn't big it was hard to find a seat. The server cane one time and never returned. The food was pricey but just okay.  Needless to say say maybe say maybe could come comeback on a different day.   I prefer to go across the street to Greek town Casino because I wasn't impressed with the live music.
10/4/2021,5 star rating,Great atmosphere..seeming to be a more mature crowd who enjoy good food and good music.....went in to pick up a to go order while in town for a concert.....food was fresh and nicely priced. Even with all the people and loud music the service was excellent.
1/12/2021,3 star rating,"Damn Floodsies was hella tight. The food not so great, the music was fire (soul/jazz) and the men although not attractive were grabbing me left and right. Soul music, average food, a large bill but my fat white ass has never gotten so much attention. I'll take it. Floodsies for the win. I ended up getting scored on. Wooo Wooo Wooo. Whitmer open this place back up (more then just your husband deserve to let out of their cage). I'm thirsty!!!Go Floodsies!"
7/23/2019,5 star rating,"This spot was a little ratchet and I loved it. They charge a cover on the weekend. One night it was a live band on one side and a DJ on he other, the second night it was karaoke night. The food and service was great. Everybody was friendly and smiling, happy to be here which is a plus. I had the buffalo shrimp, which it looks like they make a lot of orders of. They were seasoned well. But they didn't have blue cheese. Weird, but whatever. I had greens and string beans which were kind of salty. But still a solid meal. If I was back in geeektown, I would definitely check this spot out again. Get some blue cheese y'all! Lol"
7/7/2021,1 star rating,Worst place I have ever been to in my life I saw bugs every where I saw a rat on the dance floor I was definitely petrified. I thought that it was going to be a night full of music and fun but I was definitely disappointed at the service and hygiene of this business.
12/5/2021,1 star rating,Over priced and soggy fried shrimp. Ask them to make well done and it was everything but that. Greasy and over priced. Waitress charged me 20% gratuity for a single meal carry out. Did not tell me this before taking my walk in order
1/7/2019,4 star rating,"I have visited Flood's several times over the past fifteen years. However, it has been a staple for members of my immediate community for several years prior to that.Floods is in a great location, across from Greektown Casino. They offer valet parking. There are also several paid parking lots ($5 or $10) and also street parking, which is a premium.There is a cover charge most nights of $10. Please note:  your person will be searched before entry as well as your handbag. This will sometimes take place outside on the sidewalk which isn't private at all. I sometimes feel this is an invasion being that there can be several men standing there watching. At the end of the day, I'd really rather be safe, so I get over it. *shrugs* Anyway; keep any personal protection items, etc. in your vehicle.On the nights that I have visited, which are usually a Friday or Saturday night, there has been a live band on one side of the venue and a DJ on the other, by the small dance floor. The music is usually great.Drinks are priced comparably and are made well ...sometimes too well *wink*. There is always a regular seated at the bar who can recommend some cool and interesting sounding concoction. There are two bars to serve you; and waitresses who do a good job of making rounds.The food varies from usual bar fare to dishes such as stir fry.There is an ATM inside in case you need extra cash.  Floods is usually filled with singles and groups of friends. The place is crowded most of the time; you will surely rub shoulders , make a pal or two, or run into a friend from work or about town."
4/4/2019,5 star rating,"One of my favorite spots in Detroit is Flood's. It's an older spot for folks to hit up, but is always a great time. If you love STRONG drinks, they will not let you down as they will have you feeling great. The food is great as I love the catfish and shrimp. The portions are smaller, but we need to eat with smart portions so I like the size cause it ain't healthy. The Mac and cheese is very good and the yams are good too. Cornbread was cool. I try to come here whenever I'm in town.My waitresses was really cool as she was familiar with Cleveland, which was really interesting."
10/3/2018,4 star rating,"Yep, I could kick it here all night. Although small, they were able to pull off a live band and DJ, at the same time, within the venue--I'll take it. We were able to find a table but it quickly got crowded. It took a while to flag down a server but once we did, the drinks and food came out pretty quickly. For some reason I was on a chicken spree (nothing new, ha) while in Detroit and ordered the wings and shrimp combo, with greens and green beans--everything was good. I was surprised by the size of the shrimp as they were huge and the wings were cooked and seasoned just right. Both veggie sides were good and cooked with meat (I think) and seasonings--if they were out a can, they sure did put their foot in them after they poured them into the pot. I also had a bite of sweet potatoes and they were on point too. We were there for a conference and I'd awaken early that day and needed to do a repeat the morning after. If I wasn't attempting to be a responsible adult (and quite frankly, coherent the next morning), I would have stayed until they put me out. But you know, this grown up adult life is something else.Ohh there was a $10.00 cover charge at the door--don't know if that was normal or if they wanted to capitalize cause folks were in town, but you know---it is what it is and be prepared just in case."
4/2/2019,4 star rating,"We came in here with my bf's friend from work. They have security outside, which is pretty cool. He checks ids and makes sure you aren't bringing in anything. The vibe on the inside is pretty cool. They have nice bar seats. We sat at the bar and they brought drinks over quickly. There was karaoke. A lot of people were having fun dancing and singing. The place was pretty full. We were not hungry, but some of the platters I saw looked delicious. I loved the atmosphere. On the side of us, some gentlemen were setting up as well. They were fixing the sound and had drums. We ended up heading put early due to work the next day. We definetely had a great time and we hope to come back soon."

We said Dinner, but Gloom and Rain changed all that...lol.Haven't been here in a while! and before I jump into my Bar-Side EXperience!!

9/13/2020,1 star rating,"This Place was Absolutely Terrible, The Food Was Greasy Our Server Kayla Was Trying To Make Bank Off The Gratuity By Charging Us A Party Of 4 All On The Same Bill, She Didn't Want To Give Us Separate Bills Until She Saw That We Had Different Forms Of Payment. We Got There At 10 Our Food Didn't Come Until Almost 11:30. The Portions Are Very Very Skimpy & I Was Still Hungry After I Left & The Prices DONT Match What You Are Getting I Paid 29.50$ & Could Have Spent That At A Strip Club & Got Way More Food!! Also Need To Work On Adding More Food To Their Menu!! OH YEA & IT WAS A 10.00$ COVER CHARGE!!"
6/19/2020,1 star rating,"Man, this hurts to write.TL:DR - food took too long, manager was not responsive, Juneteenth goal of supporting black business ruined.Attended a BLM rally on Juneteenth, and was looking for a black-owned business to literally throw money at. I arrived when the place was fairly empty, but within 30mins or so other people began to arrive. You would think my takeout order was secured. Guess again.While waiting, I ordered a few cocktails. The couple sitting next to me complimented me on my choice, and we began to make small talk. They were celebrating their 20-something anniversary, so I offered to buy them both the same cocktails I ordered. Now the place is filling up, and I closed out my tab (including a +20% tip). I wait a little longer then realize other people I watched come after me are eating. The couple's cocktails arrived, they were the wrong drinks. The bartender's response when we pointed it out: 'sorry we don't have that anymore.'90 mins after ordering, I'm growing increasingly frustrated while trying to track down what happened. Throughout the whole ordeal, the manager is too busy to show their face for a basic 10sec apology (please, management, don't worry about apologizing now; had an hour to do that while I waited for the food I canceled).Eventually voided my order. But the worst part about the entire thing: by the time I left, it was too late to order soulfood from a different restaurant to celebrate Juneteenth smh."
5/28/2018,5 star rating,"My trip to Detroit, Mi was inspired by This American Life's podcast episode ""We are in the Future""(Act 2) that aired August 18, 2017. The producer came to Flood's and I was convinced that I had to come. The podcast describes a venue with 2 sections for 2 Dj's but during my encounter they added a tent to over the outside. So it was like 3 rooms with 3 Dj's. GPS doesn't give precise directions sounds. If you make it to Beaubien St. make a LEFT on E. Lafayette  Blvd. Flood's will be on your right. They offer valet parking and $5 self parking across the street @ the church. Alright, so the crowd was of mixed ages AND I was definitively the youngest thang present (26 @ time of visit and review). As the podcast said it was definitely provides 110% of blackness between the foods and music genres being served During the Memorial Day celebration we enjoyed the chicken sandwich and the wings & catfish tenders. Other than the unsalted fries everything else was great. The catfish tenders were seasoned really well. Even though the 3 wings(drum, flat, & tip= 1) were small it was still filling. My sides were the collard greens with Mac & cheese"
1/3/2020,1 star rating,"I went to Floods New Years Eve 2020 party and my friend bought 2 tables with food and champagne, I was seated with a couple I didn't know end they walked out with a $23.00 drink bill and I'm sure it wasn't intentional. The waitress ask me where was the couple when I wanted to pay my bill and I told her I didn't know and I didn't know and didn't realize they were gone, she told me in a smart ass voice well you stuck with their bill and I said excuse me. She went and got two male employees like that was going to intimidate me and I expressed to her that I am not paying someones bill because you said so you just fukked that up, I gave her my card she charged it $33.60 and I left a $5 tip even though she was nasty to me. I purposely paid with my Cash App card to see the payment history and I have alerts on all my card.  I got the alert of the bill being paid at $33.60 minus the tip, this morning I get an alert from my card company that my card was changed $65.00 and that is fraud on every level. I contacted the card company and will be contacting the police, it's the principal you can just take my money!!!"
12/29/2019,4 star rating,Visiting from Texas and came here. Super crowded but our server was nice and attentive in the midst of the chaos. Best bar food I ever had in my life! We got the seafood sampler and a side of greens and Mac n cheese. You don't find good comfort food like this in bars in texas. I highly recommend the Bill Cosby to drink. The only thing that was a bit much is there is a live dj in the back plus live music in the front.. you are screaming for your party to hear you. All in all will definitely be back.

10/19/2019,2 star rating,They charge a cover charge on the weekends. We got here around 830 security charges $5 if you don't have cash they do have an ATM! Which charges you $5 to take your own money out  The food is just decent! I ordered a catfish dinner and ended up receiving catfish nuggets. The yams weren't really good neither were the greens. The service was good though the bartender  kept checking on us! The food wasn't really seasoned. I'd come back they play good music! Also my Bahama mama drink tasted like juice and not liquor.

9/21/2020,1 star rating,"So I got over on my lunch break to order some food because they stop taking carryout orders at 10. I go to the door and the 2 large security people (one male and one female) tells me that it's a $10 cover. I say I just want to order my food. They both repeat ""$10 cover charge for anyone that comes in"" now I'm in full uniform and Floods is across the street from a 24 hour establishment and their kitchen don't close until 1am. I'm confused ‍ I'm coming in to place an order and then go back to work and you're trying to charge me $10 to come in and pick up some food that I'm about to pay for! I'm in full uniform, do I look like I'm trying to chill with y'all at 12am??? No I look like I'm on my break and tryna get some damn food. Ok another place that's off the list and I'm disappointed because their food is good but yet again the customer service SUCKS BALLS !!!! You are dead wrong for charging customers $10 or any amount to come inside to pick up food that they've already paid for. I'm well aware of how cover charges work. However, do you really think that that fair? Or would you pay any amount to walk into an establishment to pick up TOGO food, that you pre-ordered and paid for??? Certain nights you have a cover charge, cool, but how is that ok to charge ppl that are picking up TOGO ORDERS, and leaving???"

4/12/2019,4 star rating,"Was in town for work and hopped on the People Mover and came right here. It's a bar, just remember that. When you walk in, you have to show your ID and if you're carrying a bag, they ask to look inside it. If you arrive after 8pm, you'll have to pay a $10 cover. You seat yourself, there's no hostess. It's dimly lit inside, which makes it hard to read the food menu. The music i great. They have a playlist and then they have a live music. They don't have a drink menu, so you'll need to know what you want. But they can make standard cocktails like LITs, sex on the beach, etc. Beware that they make their drinks strong. They have some fine print on their menu that if you don't like your drink, you can return it but they won't refund you any money, they'll just remake the drink. The food was great. I ordered the wing dinner with mac and cheese and yams. Now being from the south, I'm particular about my yams and mac and cheese. I asked the server if the mac and cheese was good and he said yes. So I tried my luck and ordered it as a side. Much to my surprise, the mac and cheese was bangin. It was definitely reminiscent of southern style mac and cheese. The yams on the other hand, are just okay. One of my yams wasn't cooked enough. The fried chicken wings were great. They were well seasoned and fried to perfection. I also ordered the peach cobbler. I was expecting a small bowl with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It can in a huge bowl with the ice cream on the side. The peach cobbler was great and the crust was buttery and flaky. Just how I like it."

I arrived there very thirsty, and us beer connoisseursknow that commonly an establishmentscoldest beer is their beer on tap. Floodsdoesn't have beer on tap. Next I attempted to quench my parched palette with a Margarita it was served to me minus salt on the rim,I double checked the menu to very the formula.The last straw for me was I ordered an MGD,when it was served to me in a can, that's when I knew I was in the wrong place.

Service was very good.  Drinks were good. A good time to come is between 8 and 9pm, tables and chairs are still available.  They have a DJ and Live band.  Great crowd- age ranges 30-50 yrs  Casual environment. Come casual cute.  Band started turning up around 9:45.   Band added another dimension to an already great vibe. The music was rockin. $10 cover charge after 8pm.  Free before 8pm. Party crowd starts heading in around 9pm. This location closes at 2am.  Parking is about a block away on Saint Antione st. $10 but they do have valet parking at the club closer to its entrance."
4/29/2017,4 star rating,"*There's a Groupon, but it isnt valid toward happy hour specials. Expect automatic gratuity with the Groupon (18%) even if your group is less then 4*Definitely go for HAPPY HOUR (I just used cash and saved my groupon for our food), the drinks are STRONG (especially the long island). Get there EARLY, seats fill quickly and people lounge for a few hours minimum lol. Besides the extended wait for our food (around 45 min-hour), I enjoyed my time. First time having their shrimp, they were DELICIOUS! Wings and catfish were good as well, along with the greens, mac and cheese and coleslaw. We sat on the ""DJ"" side, and he played a nice mix of music. On the way out we lounged on the ""Live band"" side, they were jammin too! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was the wait time for our food, Floods definitely needs to hire more waitresses and kitchen staff."
5/21/2019,3 star rating,"5 stars for the live music.  3 for the food.  1 for the service.I've been before, but this is the first time I've ordered anything.Every time I've attended has been on a Thursday night and the band they have playing is amazing.  They do jazz inspired covers of pop and r&b songs and the musicianship is world class.  It's plenty loud, but you should expect that.  Dont go to a place with live music to have a conversation.On my most recent visit I ordered food, the Flood's Sampler and the steak appetizer.  It took forever to put in my order and the woman who took it acted like it was a major inconvenience.  (There were a number of people there but it was far from packed.)  It took almost an hour for my food to arrive, and when it did, I had to chase her down to get her to give it to me.  After I started eating, I realized I did not have the correct food.  The sampler I ordered included chicken wings and there were no chicken wings on my plate.  I flagged her down again, and asked where my wings were.  She said ""You ordered the seafood sampler it doesnt come with wings!"" I said no I didnt, I ordered the Flood's sampler.  She said ""you have to talk to the kitchen"", but then proceeded to grab my plate,  Another 30-40 minutes later someone came back from the kitchen with the same plate, with all the other food removed from it, and just the wings on it.  As it turned out she also charged me for the more expensive item-- the Seafood Sampler.If there had been anyone else there to talk to I would have asked for a refund on the spot.  I am still tempted to call or dispute the charges with my credit card company since I never actually got what I ordered.  It's the first time in the history of dining out that I have not left a tip.The steak appetizer was bland and slightly tough.  The catfish tenders were very good.  The wings were ok.  There was some sort of remoulade sauce on my plate, before she took it away, that was also very good.I really want to support venues that support great live music which is why I'm still giving 3 stars.  But they made it hard."

8/25/2019,1 star rating,How does this place even stay open? I've been here a hand full of times and lastnight was my last! 1.We had to pay $10 to get into a damn restaurant...Why? 2. Took forever to get service. When we did get service the bartender managed to destroy a simple Manhattan (as a bartender I'm sure that's one of the first drinks I learned to make) we each took a sip and let him know it was disgusting (he even said he that he didn't know how it was supposed to taste) so we ended up just getting woodford reserve on the rocks. He wouldn't even take them off the drinks off of the bill. So basically we had to pay for him being a bad bartender! 3. The food‍ was...ok 4.The music was nice

7/16/2018,4 star rating,"During my weekend adventures me and some friends stopped in here to grab some food and a few drinks. I had not been here in some years so I was a little excited to come again because their soul food is known to be one of the best in downtown Detroit. First my complaint, I have been a fan of establishments that charge you a fee to come in and eat. I get it that you are a bar(club type) place but geesh. You have to pay to valet, I have to pay for drinks, I have to tip the lady handing me tissue in the bathroom too!! Anywho, the good part is there was a live band(sorry I missed their name) but they were really good! We were lucky to find a seat at the bar and was quickly served and ordered some very good drinks!! We ordered food that came out pretty fast and was hot and delicious!! Also they now have an outside patio area for those nice evenings which is becoming really popular with alot of bars and such. Also there is dancing and a dj on the other half of the club. I gave it 4 stars only because of the food and drinks."
4/21/2018,5 star rating,Nice place to just hangout. The food here is great.  Right across from Greektown Casino.
9/21/2019,5 star rating,I'm addicted to the food here lol it's always a great atmosphere every time I stop by. It can get very crowded by the staff don't keep you waiting
6/12/2019,4 star rating,"Phenomenal dry rub for their chicken. The epitome of a true soul food experience. There is somewhat of a dress code and there will be loud live music but everyone will be dancing, servers and bartenders alike. A good time. Good food. Good experience."
6/5/2019,5 star rating,"I've had great experiences at Flood's during happy hour! The bar can get very full but the service has always been solid. Being vegetarian I haven't ate much, but it is my favorite mac n cheese and corn bread in town! My friends had the catfish and said it was some of the best they've had. The prices are reasonable and the drinks are pretty strong! The environment is fun and the music is on point between r & b and hip hop oldies. It can be an older folk crowd but everyone is friendly and having a good time."
6/2/2015,3 star rating,"I went here with a friend on a weeknight. We had the groupon that included an appetizer, two entrees and two drinks. We ordered the steak tips, the grilled chicken that came with two sides - green beans and a baked potato and my friend ordered the pork chops and two sides which i can't remember :)  We each ordered a dirty martini. The grilled chicken and the portions were really good and large. But the steak bites were extremely chewy and mostly fat - so I knocked off a star for that. My opinion of restaurants that do Groupons should be trying to impress the diners to bring them back for a full-price experience. Just an opinion, though. The dirty martinis were strong and we ordered extra olive juice, because they had no olive juice flavor. They did the job though, but when you're drinking for content - not just to get rowdy, you look for taste. The last star was lost because although our waitress was kind, she was barely present. We waited an extremely long time for everything for a weeknight and spent a total of three hours there. Also, when we arrived...we just sat down. No one told us where to go or greeted us and we stood very confused. I'd wait a while before returning, but it is a Detroit classic...so go ahead and get your own opinion on the joint :)"
10/1/2017,4 star rating,"Now this restaurant and bar provides live entertainment of music. You can enjoy a live band on one side and a dj on the other side. The food was decent and the drinks were too. The music was great but you have to pay $10 to get in, plus your food and drinks. Then finding a place to seat on your own. Along with bang of them all...when you enter the bathroom welcome to the candy lady with all the candy, gum, breath mints and gum, needing to charge your phone you can do it there, and there was even a pay phone in there very different especially for kids who never met a pay phone but do not bring any kid after 9 pm there it's like a night club with $5 valet parking. It's kool to try!"
9/23/2019,4 star rating,Hadn't been here in quite some time so I wasn't aware of how the food was. Turns out it was really good! Rivals most of the soul food restaurants in the city. I certainly recommend trying it out.
4/13/2019,1 star rating,Absolute nightmare! Above average food. Absolutely the worst service I've ever witnessed. We sat down to eat and watched the people that arrived before us getting up to leave because after 25 minutes they hadn't even received their water yet or had they seen their waiter yet.
11/11/2017,4 star rating,Good bar with soul food options.  Nice music.  I would have given a five star but my waitress was not the friendliest.  She seemed a little bit annoyed when I sat down.  Little did she know that I'm a great tipper and she only got the average tip from me tonight.  You never know what you are missing out on when you are not friendly.

6/12/2020,1 star rating,"I don't know if it's because of the pandemic but I just ordered food from here and it was all awful. The wings were dry and old, the Mac and cheese was bland and my bfs lamb chops were meatless. The fact that we paid 65 for awful food is disheartening. We loved floods but won't be back until I know they serving fresh food again."
1/3/2020,1 star rating,"I went to Floods New Years Eve 2020 party and my friend bought 2 tables with food and champagne, I was seated with a couple I didn't know end they walked out with a $23.00 drink bill and I'm sure it wasn't intentional. The waitress ask me where was the couple when I wanted to pay my bill and I told her I didn't know and I didn't know and didn't realize they were gone, she told me in a smart ass voice well you stuck with their bill and I said excuse me. She went and got two male employees like that was going to intimidate me and I expressed to her that I am not paying someones bill because you said so you just fukked that up, I gave her my card she charged it $33.60 and I left a $5 tip even though she was nasty to me. I purposely paid with my Cash App card to see the payment history and I have alerts on all my card.  I got the alert of the bill being paid at $33.60 minus the tip, this morning I get an alert from my card company that my card was changed $65.00 and that is fraud on every level. I contacted the card company and will be contacting the police, it's the principal you can just take my money!!!"

2/20/2019,5 star rating,"Excellent food and atmosphere. We sat at the bar and the staff was very attentive.  Highly recommend catfish, chicken wings, greens, and cornbread. Get there before 6:00 for happy hour pricing, but regular prices are reasonable as well. We will return!"

5/28/2018,5 star rating,"My trip to Detroit, Mi was inspired by This American Life's podcast episode ""We are in the Future""(Act 2) that aired August 18, 2017. The producer came to Flood's and I was convinced that I had to come. The podcast describes a venue with 2 sections for 2 Dj's but during my encounter they added a tent to over the outside. So it was like 3 rooms with 3 Dj's. GPS doesn't give precise directions sounds. If you make it to Beaubien St. make a LEFT on E. Lafayette  Blvd. Flood's will be on your right. They offer valet parking and $5 self parking across the street @ the church. Alright, so the crowd was of mixed ages AND I was definitively the youngest thang present (26 @ time of visit and review). As the podcast said it was definitely provides 110% of blackness between the foods and music genres being served During the Memorial Day celebration we enjoyed the chicken sandwich and the wings & catfish tenders. Other than the unsalted fries everything else was great. The catfish tenders were seasoned really well. Even though the 3 wings(drum, flat, & tip= 1) were small it was still filling. My sides were the collard greens with Mac & cheese"
5/10/2018,2 star rating,"Ok, this place is cramped, the music is great...the have live music on Wednesdays and other nights starting at 9:30pm. They do have a happy hour but it ends at 7 If I'm not mistaken. Upon my visit, I sat at the bar and NO ONE greeted me or attempted to take my order, there were 3 people behind the bar, I sat there patiently for a good 30 min being ignored and it wasn't until i grabbed the attention of one guy behind the bar that I was then, able to order a drink and food. I asked ""how many shrimp come in the appetizer""? He replied, 5 and I said ""FOR 12 DOLLARS THATS CRAZY""! and he said sarcastically ""you're always welcome to make shrimp at home in your kitchen""! Now, i would like to think that if you're working for tips that you would have a little more tact in the way that you speak to your customers but he didn't SMH. Ok, moving on...i ordered the grilled pork chop dinner with Mac and cheese and greens....it took a good 45min-1hr for me to get my food and when i said something to the bartender he basically said ""what do you expect, it takes time to cook""! He offered no apology and continued about his business. Now, the food was good and that's why they're getting 2 stars from me. The music was nice BUT all those sarcastic side line comments that were made were uncalled for and unprofessional and that's the reason I DON'T FREQUENT THIS PLACE. IF you decide to go...pack your patience and leave your nerves at home!!!"

The food was fabulous and the server was awesome (thank you Joann for looking out for me!) the lamb chops were huge and tender! The wings with her handmade BBQ sauce were finger lickin' good! The Salmon had a great char to it but super moist! Will definitely repeat next time in the D! Oh, and the cornbread - like a sweet hot moist cake! The people around us were great to visit with - had a great time with it all! What a find just around the corner from Greektown!"
1/21/2018,2 star rating,"The food is great at this place, but wait staff lousy. Appeared to not be customer friendly or just not happy with job. I'm told lots of change over happens with staff. Not sure why , maybe personality, lack of experience, not sure. My Food was order and notice that people who order perhaps 30 min later, received their food first. When it was mentioned to waitress, she made up excuses and never check to see when food was coming. Appeared annoyed and reluctant  to come over to table to see how her service was and to see if you needed anything. However, when the food did come out, it was good and warm.The service almost makes you not want to go to this place. Once receiving our bill, we gave over the amount and didn't receive our change until we mentioned it.  It appeared that she did this to several people. Perhaps she thought no one would noticed. But tonight people did. I think mostly everyone in this waitress section were complaining about her attitude and lack of remorse for her poor service. Once people brought the issue to the waitress, of not providing correct change , she brought the proper change back. So not sure if this is the norm,  but I would be very careful to review your bill and make sure everything is what it said on menu as far as  price.  She also charged 18 percent tip on the bill, And I don't have an issue with that, if the service was inline with it.  Wish this place would get better staff to serve food. It's really sad when you enjoy the food and have an awful waitress.  Oh they have live entertainment and that was good , however, after 11pm a different crowd comes in.. A little on the younger side.. under 30."

I arrived there very thirsty, and us beer connoisseursknow that commonly an establishmentscoldest beer is their beer on tap. Floodsdoesn't have beer on tap. Next I attempted to quench my parched palette with a Margarita it was served to me minus salt on the rim,I double checked the menu to very the formula.The last straw for me was I ordered an MGD,when it was served to me in a can, that's when I knew I was in the wrong place. Floods for me was a weird science, but it works for others"

2/29/2016,1 star rating,Terrible wait  on a monday. Under staffed 45 min wait to order. The waitress took 10 patrons orders at once without writing down anything we'll see if it comes out right.
7/16/2015,2 star rating,"I really want to like the closest bastion of civilized food to me in the D. I do. But they're making a happy relationship so hard to form. First, there is the hours. Floods isn't open and available when most I need him. Right around lunchtime, those doors are shut and the interior is dark. He's like the guy who only works from 4 to midnight. Forget showing up any time human, he's not there. This area cries out for a decent American style restaurant open at lunch. But nope, he's determined not to. Then there's the food. When he is on, he serves up some good stuff. The hot corned beef is pretty tasty on a rainy day, and the onion roll especially does it for me. That pairing works great. This is one of the few places I know that does catfish in abundance, whether a sandwich, tenders, or a fillet that's broiled, fried or done Cajun style. You know what I want for lunch right now? Some beers battered catfish, maybe. Can I get it? Big nope. Sides are very southern in character: greens, tomatoes and onions, yams. Peach cobbler actually counts. If you get an entree, you could order dessert -as a side-! How brilliant is that? But make sure you drop in during those available hours. It's so frustrating because the dinner rush is usually pretty packed, so it makes the kitchen harder to judge. I've had some totally wilted, sad soul fries that weren't spicy so much as souls of sedate women wishing they had some spice. Then I've had them turn out brilliant. There is no explanation. The service is also a bit spotty. It's like he forgets you're around while he wanders around doing his thing. I had my waitress appear all of twice on my last visit: to take an order, and then after I flagged down someone else to ask for my bill. I take off a star for that because service here just needs to be dialed up some. I want to like Floods. It's a 2.5."
9/28/2018,5 star rating,It's just a Detroit classic!! I remember being young awaiting my 21st Birthday so I could finally go to Floods. It's like a rights of passage. Great food and the drinks are strong!!! This place is an absolute mainstay in the story of Detroit! Excellent happy hour that includes food.

8/13/2017,2 star rating,"I typically enjoy Floods, their food is good and their drinks are usually decent, however my last visit changed my view somewhat. I attempted to come in at 5:05 pm on a Thursday and was stopped at the door for a $10 cover charge. The guy at the door stated they had the ""run of the house"" for the evening. I have a real problem with my friend and I paying $20 just to come in to spend money. No band was playing, not even music from the radio for that matter and he never attempted totell us what type of event he was having. Needless to say we walked right back out the door and took our money else where.  I will never pay a cover to come in a restaurant/bar just for dinner."
8/19/2017,4 star rating,"Love floods happy hour! $4 chicken wings, $3 potato skins, and $5 strong islands. Only thing is that the service is slow. Also make sure you dress to impress or you won't get in. This is an older crowd so be prepared to see a lot of you great aunts and uncles. There is live music, but no one is dancing. So if your looking to get food with a buzz for cheap after work, this is the spot!"

7/29/2018,1 star rating,"This is the worst service I'd received in awhile. It was seat yourself which wouldn't be an issue if they had bussers and/or servers who were on top of getting tables cleaned. That wasn't the case. It took asking two different people and maybe 15 minutes to even get a clean table. Our server was the worst!! It took another 15 minutes for him to bring us menus and water. It seemed he forgot our table. He'd check on the other tables in our section and ignore ours. By the time we received food, we didn't even want it because off poorly we were treated. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone."
4/10/2015,5 star rating,"We went here on a Sunday night for dinner.    I ordered the fried chicken dinner.  Chicken was crispy and breading very subtle.  My Lady ordered the Lamb chop and was pleased.  However, we both agreed it was the side dishes that really shined.  I really don't like sweet potatoes.  Yet after one taste of the whipped sweet potatoes, I wanted to eat as much as I could get my hands on.  .  My lady said the mac and cheese was the best she ever tasted. For entertainment, they have a Dj on one side and a live band on the side.. The drinks are Cheap and good.."

10/17/2012,4 star rating,"I've been to Floods twice, both times to watch debates (VP and presidential).  Both times the service was great and the drinks were good, but most importantly, the debate was on every screen and the volume was up.  It was clear that the whole bar was engaged in the event, unlike other bars I had been to.  My friend got fries and they were fast and good.  I haven't had the food yet, but I will be back."
2/9/2017,1 star rating,Worse service ever. Never got our drinks then waited an hour for our food. If there wasn't security at the door we woulda left without payin and that's the dam truth !
10/9/2014,4 star rating,"I now officially feel old...my father used to go to Floods, and now I do :-(But I can see why--the live music/band is excellent.  They always feature local artists that play a mixture of old school and current tunes.  The food was on point too.  I'm now a huge fan of buffalo shrimp and Floods did not miss the mark on this appetizer at all.Floods gives me a good feeling about my home city: somewhat diverse crowd, great music and eats, and just an overall kick-back-and-have-a-good-time feeling.  It's the perfect after work, date, group, or even singles hangout.  It's a historic detroit staple that shouldn't be missed...old or young!"
12/13/2016,2 star rating,Brag about Floods too friends but was embarrassed  by the service. We waited 15 minutes before the waitress came and that's only because I got the bartender to send her  She gave us no menus for another 10 minutes. Then we ordered got water and drinks 15 minutes later. Finally after an hour we got our food but had no cutlery to eat with or napkins  Food was alright but a lady asked were we about to go and then screamed to her party we got a table  rude and inconsiderate they just stood there looking at us. So I apologized to my guests and we left. I try to patronize our businesses but customer service is awful and very embarrassing.
4/11/2015,4 star rating,"The 4 stars is purely for the quality of food I received. Came here for my friends 25 birthday. I was very reluctant to go because my Grandfather frequents this place alot which means this place is for a very mature crowd (im only 24 and not looking for a sugar daddy). Its a cozy place so we were packed in there like sardines but my friend had reserved tables so sitting was not a problem. One of the hardest things was tracking down a waiter to place food and drink orders. It took 20 minutes for me to track down a waiter then another 30 minutes for me to get my food. And he forgot i wanted water so i had to wait even longer for that. I understand that this place was busy but the wait and inattentiveness was ridiculous especially when gratuity was already included in my bill because of the party size.All of that aside lets get to the good part my food :-).  It was amazing to say the least i believe someones grandmother is back there throwing down at the stove. It reminded me of sunday dinners at my grannys house. The chicken was crispy and seasoned. The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy. And the yams had me humming while I ate them!!    I will most def come back for the food but not during club hours, this will have to be a pick up and go or after work type thing."

9/30/2016,1 star rating,"The food is good, but the service is terrible. They may have been short staffed, but I noticed how some of the staff catered to their friends or associates. It took about 20 minutes before we were asked about drinks. We couldn't get anyone to put an order in for food. The unprofessional waitress had an attitude when I asked can my table order food and replied sure you can and never took the order. I had to sit at the bar just to order and be acknowledged. Some people have no business dealing with customers, especially if you feel unwelcomed and insulted. Make sense to see if people are hungry if their table is empty. Rotten customer service, even saw a waitress drink a shot and watch people do the hustle while people are hungry as ever."
9/2/2016,2 star rating,So I went to Floods last night and I was not impressed. The food was terrible and the service was slow. I ordered a simple chicken Caesar salad and was very disappointed. The lettuce came from a bag and the chicken taste like pre cooked chicken . The Caesar dressing taste like tarter sauce . I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio and the wine glasses were so small. I paid 7 dollars for one small glass of cheap wine . One of the positive aspects  of the evening  was the band.
7/3/2016,1 star rating,"I would give 0 stars. I went just to get carry out. Guy at door said I would have to leave my ID until I came out. Umm absolutely not. Why would I leave my ID with all of my valuable information and risk them ""losing"" it or some unforeseen instance just for carry out. I showed my disapproval and he was pretty much like ""ok fine with me"" and returned my ID and refused service. This is ridiculous considering they serve food and some ppl want carry out. Will NEVER support again with these type of policies."

The waitress JoAnne kept saying I'll be right with you, even the DJ got management and still no service.  We attempted to order drinks directly from the bar and was told we had to get it from our server!  I could not believe the type of business these people are running.  Whoever owns this place is a JOKE!  Needless to say, management decided to get another server to take our order and he was touched.  I informed him that management agreed to give us happy hour prices and he said absolutely NOT!  I felt like I was being punked!  Our ""new"" server argued with us and someone that was at the DJ booth had to calm him down.  Mind you, the DJ got management three times for us, I informed him I couldn't even get a drink while he was on this 5th!  Well, we finally ate at 10:25 and still no drink!  The food was good but the service was horrible.  I will never, ever, step foot in that place again and if you want good service you wouldn't either!"
3/1/2016,1 star rating,Too bad there's not a zero star option. One of the worst restaurant experiences in my life. Service was non existent and the manager was a spineless wimp who hid in the kitchen and refused to speak with me. It took 40 minutes to get a server and then still couldn't get a drink. Server informed us dinner would take one and a half to two hours to get served. Asked for manager. Server diappeared for rest of night. It was beyond ridiculous.  I don't know how they stay in business.
3/1/2016,1 star rating,"I purchased a groupon for $50 and yesterday was the last day before it expired. I went with my girl n her mom. We got there about 8:30 and sat at the bar. They were very short staffed and the customers were all upset with the long wait times and lack of customer service. After waiting for an hour, the owner's brother comes out and says that they would extend everyone's groupon till Wednesday. He stated that they were running out of food. There was no more Mac n cheese, yams, shrimp, and a slew of other items. At this point, I had to take of half my menu. It was very unfortunate because I really wanted to try their food. I heard the Mac n cheese is amazing. Oh well.....  As far as customer service was concerned, it was definitely lacking. It was not the waitstaff. I believe they did the best they could do. But I don't understand why management would not prepare themselves knowing that ppl would use their Groupons on the last day. The service was extremely slow and truly unacceptable. I will not be back."

I've ate a lot of burgers in my day but this (floods burger with bacon) is seasoned perfect, with a ton of fries. Also the shrimp is huge and cooked perfectly. I love this place. Close to Enough to the law school to walk in 3 minutes. Love love love."

The appetizers are CRAZY GOOD and simply put - This joint has the best collard greens and yams in THE CITY!We found our grove on Groupon and 19.00 locked our taste buds in the pocket - Even topped it off with peach cobbler and creamy vanilla bean ice cream - Our taste buds were SCREAMING FOR MERCY by the time our check came - Load up on the sides y'all and spread your order out cause you will wait - Hey bring a friend or two and hit Greek Town - Walk it off and come back you hear? Remember that if you don't like good music, networking with friends and GOOD FOOD come to Floods anyway just for a night out - FYI they do charge a cover so make it a HAPPY HOUR!Second Thoughts - I had to PICKUP a tip that rightfully belonged to the bus man and not our server. Everything that could go wrong with service actually did - Our taste buds were QUENCHED by our being ignored waiting at a dirty table to being served cold food - Yes the greens were left sitting on the rest of the order and our wings and shrimp were not hot - Obviously our server was overwhelmed or we were were just there taking up space - Also even though we had purchased almost 50.00 worth of food ($50.00 GROUPON) the waitress failed to recognize and honor our coupon - Why? Because we had ordered appetizers and drinks during HAPPY HOUR - It wasn't even on the COUPON so what did she do? The woman walked around the place with my wife's phone and a 100.00 bill for almost 45 minutes all the time servicing other customers - I asked no less than 4 TIMES for our peach cobbler (yes) and it only arrived when the BUS MAN DELIVERED - Brother saved this joint from my wife bailing me out - I received a nice reply from management for my initial review and finally straightened out our server - However NOTHING will rescue this short of a do over - You have the means now prove that you serve GREAT FOOD AND SECOND TO NONE SERVICE!"

7/30/2013,3 star rating,"My cousins and I came for a visit this past weekend and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised; I don't make it downtown Detroit very often, so I didn't exactly know what to expect, but I found our time at Flood's to be quite enjoyable.First off, I was impressed by the valet parking for only $5.  I guess, after all, this is Detroit, and not one of the bigger (i.e. more expensive) cities where everything is inflated and grossly overpriced.  It is always nice to drive up and be able to walk right into a place, and then not have to walk blocks away afterwards to get your car.We came on Sunday night so I was expecting the place to be a little more mellow, but it was PACKED.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for valet and there was also a line to get in.  It was hard to move around inside and all the tables/seats were taken.  I heard there was a big concert that had just let out so I am assuming that is why there was such a big crowd on a Sunday night.Because of the crowd it was a bit difficult to get the attention of a bartender and it took a long time to get our drinks...and then it took a long time after that to pay and get our change.  I'm not holding it against them, because there were just SO many people there, but it is definitely worth noting.The bathroom was decent and there was a bathroom attendant who had an odd assortment of items available. Compared to the rest of the place the bathroom seemed old, outdated, and not quite as well-kept (i.e. a little on the questionable side).We did ask for menu's (which never came) but we didn't eat any food, so I would like to at least go back to try some of the items that everyone raves about!On this night there was a DJ who played a lot of stuff that is getting radio-play but also a good mix of lesser heard songs and some older stuff, as well, though it was exclusively hip-hop/rap.  The dance floor was small but there was a steady group of people enjoying themselves.The crowd wasn't necessarily diverse, which is something I really enjoy and look forward to when I go out.  That part was a bit of a disappointment.  I will say, though, the crowd was more mature, which I did enjoy, and that made the vibe more relaxed; everyone was cordial and getting along, and there definitely wasn't any of drama that comes along with the younger crowd when they've had a bit too much to drink.I will definitely give Floods another chance and I think it is a decent place to hang with friends, but I probably wouldn't frequent the place, simply because it is just not my style...but if it is up your alley, this might be the place for you!"

12/8/2012,4 star rating,"Had a mini-girl's night out the other weekend and decided to check out Floods.Used the valet and paid the cover, once inside (it was about 10pm) it was getting pretty packed.  We opted to take a seat at the bar at one of the few remaining seats.  It did not seem as if they were seating from the door at that time.  Shortly after we ordered, a nice jazz/ r&b set was getting together behind us... this made for a REALLY noisy evening but luckily they were REALLY good so it was welcome.Our bartender was our server as we were seated at the bar.  I ordered the lamb with mac & cheese and fries and my girlfriend ordered the steak bites with a salad.  It did take a VERY long time for our food to be served... but that wasn't an issue for us this evening as we were having fun people watching and chatting.  Our bartender took another drink order and I told her I wanted something strong but fruity.  She came back with a drink that looked like a bonpop.  It was DELICIOUS. (And we both ordered another by the end of the evening).Food came and it was DELICIOUS.  My girlfriend raved about her steak bites and let me try one - OMG!  Pefection.  My lamb was so juicy.  I'm not even much of a lamb eater but after a recent taste I've started to enjoy it again - and this was an icing on the cake to compound my recent lamb addiction.  I honestly didn't expect ""bar food"" to be so damn good!!  Def. worth the wait.The attitude is upbeat and fun.  A nice crowd - no riff raff that comes along with the younger groups (I'm only 29, but ya know).  I felt very comfortable here and I'm far from a dance/club type person - especially a packed one.I will repeat and recommend.  The environment is great but the food is even better!"
6/8/2015,4 star rating,"Live music + cheap drinks= awesome night in Detroit. There was a $5 cover the night I went, but it was way worth it for the live music plus dj who kept the party going simultaneously and after the live music stopped. My only critique is that the service was slow."
7/30/2008,4 star rating,"During my time in Detroit, me and the fellas used to frequent floods a lot.  Our reasons always had to do with women and food...a staple when you are a single lad in Detroit.This is a great spot to go to on Wednesday or Friday evenings.  Its like a Detroit tradition, so everybody thats ever lived in Detroit, visited Detroit, or had a conference in Detroit, usually hits Floods for their after work happy hour.  A bit of an older crowd on Wednesdays that gets a tad bit younger on Fridays, Floods is a great spot to eat/drink/get your pre dance on, prior to moving on to a real club.  Because the younger women are sometimes a bit scarce, its pretty easy to meet someone younger b/c they are looking for the same thing as you--- that didnt sound right, but you know what i mean.If you are looking to find the classic Detroiter in Gators, a hat, and some type of crazy azz looking suit...look no further, you can find em right here...lol.They do charge a cover after 7pm, but if you come in prior to that you generally have no problem.The bar is split into two separate areas, so you can generally move around pretty easily between the two...although it does get pretty packed up in here.The food is damn good.  Id recommend the wings, pork chops, greens and macaroni cheese all day!  You can typically get a meal for about $12 bucks here, and its typically amazing...although sometimes it takes a bit of time to actually get your food!All in all, I have had some great times at this place.  Gotta respect the tradition."

3/28/2019,1 star rating,"I was in town for a brief family visit and opted to break bread at Floods. The service was atrocious. I usually sit at the bar but they did not have enough seats together so we had to grab a table. We literally sat at the table waiting for a server to come over for at least half an hour. Finally we retreated to the bar (as there were now enough seats available). The bartender questioned why we left the table to start, only upon our request for menus from him. I shared that it was due to never having a server come over. He then so graciously advised that we would be billed the gratuity if we ordered food with him, nearly implying that was the reason we left the table. After I very clearly expressed that although the gratuity is not an issue, we would not have been billed a gratuity had we pulled up at the bar from the start and therefore will not be paying one now. He convinced us that it would be much easier to service and he would personally send a server over if we relocated to a table, which we did. After another 10/15 minutes...the bartender had to come out from the bar to go retrieve a server. It still took another 10 minutes before she came over. We ordered drinks and water at the same time. She brought the waters over within 10 minutes but the drinks took another 15. We placed our food order and the sides were all room temperature at best. No one ever came to clear the empties or dirty dishes. We had to move them to the empty table next to us. My daughter had to wait at least 25 minutes for a carry out box. was a sad attempt from the management, service staff, and bartender. Never go here and sit at the tables. Lesson learned."
4/16/2009,1 star rating,"This was quite possibly the worst bar that I've been to in the state of Michigan. The drinks were way too strong and were disgusting. When I told the bartender that my drink was bad he acted like he wasn't the person who made it. The staff was rude and had attitudes for no apparent reason. My waitress, who looked as if she could have been Rerun's (from 'What's Happening?') daughter had a stank attitude and was incredibly slow with my order. It took her about 20+ minutes to bring me my drink. And don't get me started on the horrendous parking they have. Your only real options are to park at the Greektown casino or valet. I personally would have rather gone to a better bar that knows how to make drinks and is fun like Bookie's or any other bar in Detroit. I would NOT recommend this bar to my worst enemy."
6/12/2011,4 star rating,"Hit up Flood's again tonight with the same friends as a few weeks before.  Still a Sunday, still $10 cover.  No line (last time was Memorial Day weekend w which added to the crowd)The bathroom attendant had her whole counter of wares set up - this time, instead of cookbooks, displayed were 2 books of kids academic activities,  to be used to keep kids fresh on their skills over the summer.  One book was for 4th grade level, one for 6th. Also offered in addition to the fancy soaps, lotions, and perfumes was a bottle of stretch mark creme.  So fascinating.Ordered a long island today - strong as hell, tall, only $5! I was amazed.From observations, the kitchen must be open until close, which is cool.  The food smelled amazing but I have still yet to taste it.  Another solid night at Flood's - this may become a Sunday night tradition for my ladies and I."
5/30/2011,3 star rating,"""pink gators, my detroit players...""The Biggie lyrics were the first thing to run through my head when I stepped into Flood's.  Located in Bricktown right next to Greektown casino, this was clearly the spot to be.  Line out the door, we waited about 10-15 minutes before getting in.  $10 cover.  Crowd inside is mature (late 20's-40), mostly African American, and well dressed (hence the ""gators"" lyrics coming to mind).  A nice option to find after trying 2 other clubs earlier in the night that seemed to be kiddie's night out (18 & up) with a ""dress to unimpress"" code.  Flood's has 2 sides - one with a DJ, one with a live band.  Both sides were cool and it was nice to have options.  My friends and I could dance a little harder with the DJ, or switch to the band side to chill a little.  The band did covers of soul & R&B hits, and I loved their sound.  I think they play every weekend, might go back just to see them.  The place was packed, making it hard to get around and even harder to get a drink.  When we finally did make it to the bartender's attention, I expected my drink to be smaller/pricier and was pleasantly surprised when my tall Bacardi & diet was only $6 (which is cheap for club prices) and it was poured nice and strong.  The bartender, who I understand was very busy, was pretty rude and acted a little annoyed with having to serve us.  Whatever.I hate when clubs have bathroom attendants (I can get my own soap and paper towel, I don't need you to hand it to me then give a dirty look if I don't tip you after).  And the Flood's attendant goes ALL OUT.  No joke, not only was there the selection of soaps and towels handed to you, but this lady was selling jewelry, purses, and COOKBOOKS (kid you not) out of that restroom.  Ridiculous.  Made for a good laugh.I saw food plates coming out, looks like they have a soul food/bar fare type of menu.  I saw fried chicken, mac & cheese, potato skins, etc.  Looked pretty tasty, but I couldn't imagine even trying to order and eat food in that crowd.  Maybe I'll head back for happy hour and try their menu then.All in all, not a place I'd frequent all the time but Flood's made for a fun night of dancing with my friends, and we all agreed we'd keep it in mind next time we're looking to hit the club."

5/10/2018,2 star rating,"Ok, this place is cramped, the music is great...the have live music on Wednesdays and other nights starting at 9:30pm. They do have a happy hour but it ends at 7 If I'm not mistaken. Upon my visit, I sat at the bar and NO ONE greeted me or attempted to take my order, there were 3 people behind the bar, I sat there patiently for a good 30 min being ignored and it wasn't until i grabbed the attention of one guy behind the bar that I was then, able to order a drink and food. I asked ""how many shrimp come in the appetizer""? He replied, 5 and I said ""FOR 12 DOLLARS THATS CRAZY""! and he said sarcastically ""you're always welcome to make shrimp at home in your kitchen""! Now, i would like to think that if you're working for tips that you would have a little more tact in the way that you speak to your customers but he didn't SMH. Ok, moving on...i ordered the grilled pork chop dinner with Mac and cheese and greens....it took a good 45min-1hr for me to get my food and when i said something to the bartender he basically said ""what do you expect, it takes time to cook""! He offered no apology and continued about his business. Now, the food was good and that's why they're getting 2 stars from me. The music was nice BUT all those sarcastic side line comments that were made were uncalled for and unprofessional and that's the reason I DON'T FREQUENT THIS PLACE. IF you decide to go...pack your patience and leave your nerves at home!!!"
9/2/2016,2 star rating,So I went to Floods last night and I was not impressed. The food was terrible and the service was slow. I ordered a simple chicken Caesar salad and was very disappointed. The lettuce came from a bag and the chicken taste like pre cooked chicken . The Caesar dressing taste like tarter sauce . I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio and the wine glasses were so small. I paid 7 dollars for one small glass of cheap wine . One of the positive aspects  of the evening  was the band.
10/2/2014,5 star rating,"Went here for dinner and drinks on a Wednesday and had a great time. I ordered the lamb chops with steamed veg and mac and cheese as my sides and I was disappointed when the food was gone because it was so good. The lamb chops were perfectly seasoned, the veggies weren't overcooked and the mac and cheese was perfectly cheesy. I will def be returning to try some of the other dishes. In addition to great food, the service at the bat was excellent! The bartender, who is also the manager, was very attentive, making sure my glass was never empty and mixing perfectly blended drinks."

3/20/2011,4 star rating,"This is one of my favorite places to go within the city. I like the mature crowd that dresses nice without all the drama that comes along with the 18-25 crowd. The menu is alright, like many have said it's bar fare with a twist of soul food. The music is great, and the live cover bands are a great change from DJ's and club music. I'd say if you enjoy the late 20's to 40's bar scene and want to hear adult R&B/dance then Floods is the place to go."
8/7/2015,4 star rating,"What can I say about the world famous Floods? Detroit would not be the same without it. This is the place that famous people visit when they come in town on tour. I've seen singers, comedians, etc. It is one of the most consistent places around. I've been coming here for years and the food is still the best ever (make you wanna slap your moma). They still charge the same $5 cover they were charging 15 years ago. No one carries cash anymore. But I can't complain about that, its the sacrifice you make for keeping the prices from the 1990s. The service is hit or miss. A lot of the staff have been around for years. Not friendly at all. They could at least pretend to like their job... And let's not talk about the bathroom attendants here. There is nothing more annoying than sharing personal space with someone and feeling obligated to give them money for things that should be free such as hand soap and paper towel. Sometimes you just want to touch up your outfit and make up in peace. Not many places to park downtown. They have valet parking which is wonderful. Despite all of the negatives, this place still manages to feel welcoming and is a cool spot to hang out with a great crowd and enjoy live music. Just be sure to bring some cash to pay the cover, tip for the bathroom attendant, and valet. Everything else you can use debit or credit."

I have never been a fan of Floods (more so the people) because the men treat the environment as if it's a spectator sport. Looking. Not dancing or conversing, just looking. As far as the establishment, the drinks are made well, the food is decent and the valet is usually pretty quick if you don't wait until the last minute to get your car.

6/18/2008,3 star rating,"Floods is one of those spots that you have to know about in order to actually go there. It is located right across from Greektown Casino, and the crowd differs depending on the night. Floods used to be a place where only the {older} crowd frequented, such as those in my mother's age range. (I actually saw my high school teacher here once..lol.) But as I got older and the establishment became more HIP, it became acceptable to go :-). Floods pretty much is known for their LIVE Jazz while you dine. They also have a hip hop DJ for the younger crowd in a side room. Depending on the night, this place can be cool and relaxing. It is a pretty narrow restaurant, so too many people can make it uncomfortable. The bar is centered in the middle, and is oval-shaped, so you are always in the vicinity of a quick drink. The food is pretty good, they have the basic bar food but also soul food options if you like macaroni, sweet potatoes and such. Because it is a narrow restaurant, always watch your back in case a waiter is running around with plates in her hand!!"
