4.5 star rating,"Seriously, what a delight. It's hard to find a vegan donut and even harder to find an amazing one, but Dilla's nailed it with their vegan sweet potato donut.  Dilla's will definitely be a new go-to stop every time I'm downtown. An added bonus - the staff were so friendly, loved offering up their recommendations, and seemed passionate! You could tell the donuts were made with love"
5 star rating,"[This visit occurred pre-COVID]It was a busy day with no time for lunch. I was concerned that I would be hungry (and therefore hangry) during a show at the Detroit Opera House. Luckily, I spotted this little doughnut shop between the parking center and my destination.Sunlight streamed into the small and serene space. I liked the quietness in the middle of the city. Album covers and other artwork crowd the counter area. Two friends enjoyed their treats and conversations by the counter that runs the length of the window. On a Saturday, there was still a variety of doughnuts available in the display case. Several vegan options, as well as a cinnamon bun, were also on display. However, the orange-pineapple one called my name. I love unusual and creative combinations that cannot be found at a neighborhood chain.I should have asked. It was a cake doughnut, instead of my preferred, a yeast-raised one. Darn. Still, I was okay with the dense doughnut with a crunchy crust and thick sugar frosting with tiny flecks of orange zest mixed in.The gentleman behind the counter was extremely courteous. He pointed out how to quickly access the opera house.I was so hungry that the doughnut was half eaten before I even got there."
3 star rating,This place is a hidden gem and a total delight. The donuts are absolutely delicious - you can tell they're all hand cut since no two donuts look the same haha. They offer up classic donuts but also vegan ones - win! The vegan sweet potato one I had tried stole the show for me. The lemon glazed donut (not vegan) was also delicious - you could see the bits of zest in there. I definitely recommend folks stop in here and get your donuts. The two ladies working the day I was there were so friendly and let us try a few new flavors they had since it was our first time in. Support small businesses - stop into Dilla's!
5 star rating,"Came Saturday morning before they let out for their Christmas break, when they had 3 vegan flavors! I had been wanting to come here for a long time and this was the push I needed. For parking I chose the street just outside, it's like a dollar an hour.  I met Yuri (I believe that's how it's spelled?) the cashier who is very nice and told a lady that came in after me a bit about the history of the place, I believe it's historical for its hip hop recording? They have Dilla merchandise too, although they're currently redesigning and restocking so sizes are limited.I also met Hermen, the nice man that makes the donuts. In my short stay here I've learned they use all natural ingredients, use rice bran oil from brown rice to fry the donuts, which are hand made, and always make the vegan donuts first so there's no cross contamination.  Everyone here is super friendly, I highly recommend this spot. It's right in the midst of downtown, has history, and heart."
5 star rating,This is an awesome little spot! I love the options of flavors. My fave was the banana pudding donut. We tried the chocolate( my boyfriends favorite) and sweet potato(yummy) as well. They also have vegan options. Merch too! I got a super cute shirt in a donut box.
5 star rating,"I would not have known about this place had it not been for my hip hop junkie boyfriend. I have lived in Detroit for one year; and he insisted that I had to make my way into this donut shop before I left. I'm really happy that I did.This place is small and simple but harbors a lot of art, culture and history. I was lucky to have come here on a Saturday afternoon when the owner (Dilla's uncle) happened to be in the shop. This place is closed on Sundays and Mondays - learned that the hard way. My boyfriend and I got two small coffees and one banana pudding donut with chocolate ganache. We sat by the window and enjoyed our donut and washed it down with it our coffees. Then I looked around to take in all the decorations and capture them in photos. Dilla's uncle saw me taking photos of the wall with a model of a the city. The kind man told me the history and the ramification of gentrification in Detroit. I am naive to the history of Detroit and asked a bunch of questions and he answered them all patiently. It's a simple little donut shop with so much history and culture. There is nothing vintage about this place; it is just an epitome of the city of Detroit."
5 star rating,"[45/100]Rest in Peace Dilla Dawg!A visit to Detroit is incomplete until two specific places have been visited. 1) Motown Museum & 2) Dilla's Delights. I was fortunate enough to both and it was a down to earth experience. It was my first stop from Chicago and I can always go for some donuts. The shop is super easy to locate, parking was plenty and donuts were delicious! I had the shop all to myself for a couple minutes and conversed with the gentleman that was working. He was friendly and helped me out with all the Detroit questions I had. I ordered three donuts and a cup of coffee. They have 3 for $5 or 2 for $5 depending the mix and match combination of donuts. I got an apple fritter, one that was banana flavored and a black bottom blueberry . My favorite was the blueberry, I should have gotten 3 of those! The apple fritter was so filling and dense. It wasn't the normal texture I had gotten accustom to but it was  still delicious. Pros:- Parking- Inexpensive- Delicious- Vegan friendly- Well kept, cleanCons:- Once they sell out, they close for the day (Be sure to go early)A definite must! Go visit if you're planning a trip or if you live in the area and have never been!Support and shop local!"
5 star rating,"Got some doughnuts from Dilla's not too long ago! The doughnuts were good but they are a thicker, cake donut (not like what you get at Dunkin'). However, what really stands out about this place is the atmosphere. There is such a cool story behind the business which the customer associate explained to us. Originally we popped in for a quick treat but we ended up talking with the employee for about 15 minutes just learning the history of the shop and the man behind it. Such a cool place in Detroit to stop by and they have awesome swag for sale too!"
4 star rating,"This is my second attempt to give this place a try. My coworkers and I often bring donuts in to our office in the casino. If I find a new spot I like, I stick with it. Your reviews tell me I'd like it. Unfortunately, short of paying $12 to park in a nearby lot, there's little to no available parking for this place. The limited number of spots on nearby streets are all filled to the max and remain so, despite my second and third circles around to scout for spots. How can we check you out if we can't even find a place to park? On to the next one."
1 star rating,I walked in here and started looking for the menu. Asked the lady here where it was and she said this is the menu and pointed at the donuts. I'm like ok... so I got a banana pudding donut and lemme tell you... life changing! I am absolutely in love with the vibe and the donuts!! Definitely a place worth trying!  Will be taking a half dozen to California with me because I know I will crave them as soon as I get off the plane!  If you're local and not trying this place out? What are you doing with your life?
4.5 star rating,"I was desperately craving a donut while on a completely dairy free diet and came here to get some vegan donuts. I ordered both vegan and non vegan donuts from here on a weekend morning and shared them with others that said they would have had no idea that they're vegan. There are free samples to taste test the different donuts. I didn't like the sourness of the lemon donuts but i absolutely love the sweet potato and really all the vegan flavor donuts. Also their whiskey barrel coffee is soo delicious, doesn't taste like whiskey at all, but has an extra flavor to it that I loved. I wish they had a larger selection of more delicious flavors. I'm definitely recommending this place to others!"
5 star rating,I absolutely love their Vegan donuts! I wish they were open more often and vegan milk or ice-cream would be great too lol
5 star rating,"So I've been on a vegan detox diet for the past 3 weeks and I had to come to Detroit for a few days due to work. I had been searching for good vegan restaurants to check out in the area, when I came across Dilla's Delights on Yelp and saw they offered vegan donuts! Decided to stop by there this morning before work and I was so glad I did. The shop has such a dope hip hop vibe to it. Upon walking in, I was greeting by the young lady working there (really wish I caught her name, she was super nice). Told her that I was interested in trying a vegan donut but wasn't sure which flavor. She asked if this was my first time dropping in and offered me a sample of all three. She said her favorite is the Blackbottom Beat Street Blueberry but the Cinnamon Raisin is always the first to sell out. All three donuts were reeeaaalllyyyy good but I went with the Cinnamon Raisin. Each one was fresh, moist, and full of flavor. They were light and sweet but not overly rich. She also mentioned that their donuts are made fresh daily by the owner with all natural and organic ingredients. Annnd, if you're a military service member like myself, coffee is only $.50; too bad I don't like coffee though lol. Overall, I love this place. If you're in the area, vegan or not, definitely give this place a try. You won't be disappointed!"
5 star rating,"This is a Gem in Downtown.  Owners and Staff are friendly,  lots of Dilla's / Detroit memorabiliaDonuts are excellent.  We went twice in three days.  Sad to have missed out on the Verners Glaze donut Next time we are in the city. I'll definitely hit this place up again and again"
5 star rating,"I had a craving for something sweet and decided to check this off the list while I was downtown. I'm not a fan of cake donuts so I ordered the lemon glazed, lime glazed, and an apple fritter.  They were 3/$5 or $2 each. First bite of the lemon glazed donut had me underwhelmed and thinking these were way overpriced. Then I warmed them in the microwave for 8 seconds and that did the trick. They were all tasty after that. It's as if they were freshly baked out of my microwave.  I'm not going out of my way for these but would have them again if they were conveniently around."
3 star rating,"Vegan donuts!I went here specifically for the vegan donuts.  I tried the cinnamon raisin and the blueberry.  They were three for five dollars and worth every penny.  I don't know what they are made of and I don't want to know as long as they are truly vegan.  What I can say it they seem more dense than regular donuts.   They are flavorable (which is a made up word) and a real treat.  The establishment itself is small, hip, and most importantly clean.  Coolest feature;  they have a sweet turntable spinning old school wax (or more likely vinyl)."
5 star rating,"I guess I'm a huge ahole for not giving this place 5 stars, but after reading the rave reviews, I was expecting a little bit more pizazz from their donuts. Even so, the location is great (close to the stadium, right downtown), and vibe inside is funky. Staff was friendly, and speedy too. The donuts we had appeared to be cake donuts- They seems lighter than other cake donuts I've had, but still has some thickness to them. My lemon donut had only a slight lemon taste to it. I would've like something more memorable. My husband reported that the coffee was only so-so - he said it tasted like run of the mill Folgers type stuff, but since I didn't have any, I'll let you be the judge."
3 star rating,I come here probably once a week or once every two weeks because I crave the donuts! My favorites are the cakeboy chocolate and the lime margarita (only in the summer). You feel so much history when you walk in and everyone is always friendly because it's family owned. I will continue giving this shop my business. My best days start at Dilla's.
5 star rating,"I'm so conflicted about this establish. On the one hand, I absolutely love the sweet potato donuts and that's the only thing I get every time. However, I can visit here 10 times and only get served twice. Apparently they close early when they sell out (I dont know why they don't make more) and that can happen as early as 1 o'clock even though they are scheduled to be open until 5. Once I called before heading there to save myself the disappointment if they were closed already. It was 4 PM and the young man that answered the phone said he was in the midst of closing early because they were ""slow"". That's kind of ridiculous to me. I don't want to leave a 3 star review because the quality of the donuts is supreme but what's the point if I can only obtain such loveliness a tiny percentage of the time"
3 star rating,"I don't get it, I saw the rave (5star) reviews and thought that this was a no brainer. It should be awesome. That was not the case at all. I agree with many others, the shop is cool and the staff is very nice, however, that's where it stops. The donuts are lacking quite a bit. For me, overall the flavors were off and should have tasted much better. I bought a decent sampling of donuts. They all missed the mark. I brought them home for my family and the consensus was ""you don't have to go there again"". Many of the donuts were tough and firm., like a day old donut. You had to microwave them to make them slightly desirable."
4.5 star rating,Vegan donuts which were very tasty. I wish there were more vegan flavors. Dope tracks playing in the background. Dilla memorabilia everywhere. What else do you need?
5 star rating,"A conference I attended provided these and I ate more doughnuts in a one day period than I have in the past three years.Delicious! Also, some of the best vegan doughnuts I've sampled."
5 star rating,Stop in for a hot chocolate while waiting for the Opera house to open.  The cashier was very friendly and fast. All the donuts looked tasty but i want to try the lemon glazed.  It was fresh and went well with my hot chocolate for breakfast.
5 star rating,"I was walking to get coffee at a shop nearby and noticed this little donut shop on the corner. As soon as I walked in, the woman behind the corner welcomed me. She was honestly SO nice. I told her I've never been there before and she immediately offered some samples. She even cut up a couple of new donuts for me to try. My two faves were the sweet potato and the blueberry. I really appreciated that neither donut was overly sweet. The sweet potato was subtle and I honestly liked it a lot. I ended up getting the blueberry so I could lie to myself about how bad donuts are since there was some dried fruit in there. Lol. Definitely stop in if you're nearby. They are a little pricey for the Midwest - it's $20 for a dozen donuts, but I'm used to that in LA."
4 star rating,"Nice spot for donuts and coffee to-go.  They got a variety here to choose from...like orange and pineapple or banana pudding, it's all good.  If you wake up early and want a treat, hit this place up."
5 star rating,These donuts are always amazing hands-down the best in Detroit Light work doughnut is the best Conant garden is just as good
5 star rating,Great spot!! Small and quiet but packs a punch get the Lemon glazed doughnut its to die for friendly staff!! Just wish they had TShirts!! Lolol
5 star rating,"I was in Detroit yesterday and wanted to check our Dilla's Delights. I've heard some mixed reviews about the donuts but wanted see for myself. Upon entering the establishment, I was warmly greeted by the employee. The shop was impeccable. I really appreciated that. With a few chosen donuts in hand, I was on my way. To my disappointment the donuts were stale. Whomp whomp. Now I will say that the flavor was there. They tasted really good, but they were all dried up. Perhaps they are best early in the morning when they're fresh. I would be willing to give them another chance in the A.M."
3 star rating,"First of all, the donuts at this place were amazing and they have vegan donuts that are JUST AS DELICIOUS!  The 4 donuts I had today were ALL fantastic:  Banana pudding, McNasty Macaroon, Lemon Glaze and the vegan one was Sweet Potato. The ranking between these is tough but from most delicious to delicious for me would have to be: Banana Pudding, Sweet Potato, McNasty Macaroon and then Lemon Glaze.  If you're a big citrus person, you're going to love how aromatic and full of flavor the Lemon Glaze donut is.  I have found my go-to place for donuts in Detroit.  If you're not coming for just the flavor of these donuts, definitely come for the staff - they are so friendly and the atmosphere. The donut shop is in the same building as an apartment complex and they have a really nice seating area inside.  This spot is a hidden gem!"
5 star rating,"This place was so fun to visit, for the family ties to JDilla and decadent vegan options for donuts!"
5 star rating,A friend recommended this place to us. Organic hip hop donuts sounds like something I'd wanna try and I'm glad we did! The guys behind the counter were super friendly and really took their time to tell us all about their donuts. I love that they have records spinning!! We had some donuts on Friday and then I had to come back on Saturday to get some more AND got some wrapped up for breakfast Sunday. The one with pineapple/orange was legit. But my fave was the McNasty macaroon donut. Support local businesses and eat here!
4.5 star rating,I was SO excited to visit Dilla's! I've sampled their impressive line up through storefronts across Detroit in anticipation for their brick and mortar spot.The lime and original glaze are my absolute favorite! The glaze is perfect and the donut itself is light and airy.We purchased four donuts for about $7
5 star rating,"AMAZING! Just come here and get the best donuts in the city. And the best coffee. It's small. It's simple. But the donuts are anything but basic ... we had a coconut cake donut and a banana donut that were out of this world. The hospitality of the staff here is reflective of Detroit -- they're enthusiastic about their craft and music.  We were treated really well. And again, this is the best donut and coffee I've ever had in the city. Just try it.  Get there early ... they sell out of donuts by early afternoon. There's a reason for that."
5 star rating,"This is crazy, I almost don't believe it myself. I didn't like my Dilla donut. I had the glazed chocolate cake, my favorite donut of all time, and it was just not tasty. It was semi moist, but tasted kind of burnt and not chocolate-y. I literally gave the other half away. $2.00 is a lot for a donut. And even worse for a sub-par donut. I'm thankful if didn't pay $20 for a dozen. Slow service was unfortunate too. I really wanted to like this place because if it's Detroit history, but I would rather go to Dunkin."
2 star rating,"As if the inventive and delicious donuts and great coffee were not enough, this little gem also offers J Dilla merchandise for those who are fans of the hip-hop legend.The woman running the shop was also extremely friendly and made my visit to Dilla's Delights a stop to remember. Can't wait to return next time I find myself in Detroit.Highly recommend the ""Lightworks Lemon"" and vegan blueberry donuts."
5 star rating,"I love donuts. I really wanted to like these donuts. Everything to the shop itself and the description of the donuts and the service was awesome. I picked out three and was just not impressed whatsoever. Honestly, they were a step below Tim Hortons donuts and those are run of the mill at best. I am willing to try it again and maybe go earlier in the morning to catch them fresher. Don't disappoint me!"
2 star rating,"Decent donuts, including vegan options. We liked the banana pudding and lemon. Overall they are a little chewy, which is unusual. An extra star for their vision as a company."
4 star rating,"Lemon, banana, and lime are three fruits you should mention when walking in. And they will submit a lemon donut, banana donut (the famous one), and the lime donut to you. They will elevate your donut experience to finding a marriage of key lime pie and a donut in the lime donut, a lemon merengue pie-like experience with the lemon donut, and... well, the banana is the most famous.Try em out! Let me know what you think! And unfortunately those are the only three that I was able to try during the week there so let me know if I missed out on some other donuts.Enjoy!"
5 star rating,"Organic doughnuts which are pretty good. HOWEVER... paying $2 for a just better than average is very steep and those are the plain donuts, filled and others are as much as $3. I almost spewed out my coffee when after ordering 4 doughnuts he said my total was $7.65. Thanks but no thanks"
2 star rating,"Donuts are phenomenal! This was a must not only for hiphop fans but for a true donut connoisseur. Light, well-balanced, not heavy and perfectly sweet."
5 star rating,"Such a great find in Detroit. Had the lemon glazed donut, the glaze is perfect with a subtle hint of lemon and the donut was light and fluffy, not overly sweet. $2 per donut, I happily pay - it's worth it!Enjoyed the tunes while in the shop!"
4.5 star rating,"Lime Nut is the possibly the best! I also like the Vegan Blueberry Cake, but they're all amazing donuts!"
5 star rating,"What a treasure. As a big fan of both J Dilla and donuts, this was an essential Detroit stop for me. I had the cinnamon sugar, the Aaliyah lemon-filled, and my fav, banana pudding. Come for the donuts and stay for the music."
5 star rating,You get delicious donuts here. That's expected.  The surprise is the hip hop history lesson that you get from Uncle.  He's eager to share his memories and the walls of the cozy sweet shop and lined with them as well.  The donuts will not disappoint.  You'll be delighted that you stopped here.
5 star rating,"I stopped in for some vegan donuts today.  They had sweet potato and blueberry.  I was going to get 3 for $5 until they offered me a sample of each, and then decided to double my order.  They're so good!  I just wish I could find their donuts closer to me.  I wouldn't mind the drive so much but the traffic in the area can get bad with events at nearby venues and  there aren't a lot of great options for parking just to run in and grab some treats real quick.  I ended up illegally parking on the corner with my fingers crossed that I wouldn't get a ticket in the 2-3 mins that I was there.  If you're anywhere remotely close by make the trip and treat yourself to these wonderful vegan donuts!!"
5 star rating,Really nice people. Popped in for doughnuts at the end of the day. Had the raspberry filled and another with lime glaze. Both were good but lime glazed was amazing!
5 star rating,"Such great employees! Small on space, but big on taste. Sweet potato donut is BOMB. Try it .  They always give free samples which I really find helpful before buying a new pastry you may not like. They also donate all their left over pastries to the YMCA which is awesome."
5 star rating,"These donuts were pretty great! Had a lemon and chocolate, delicious.  The gal up front was very nice and genuine.  Great customer service and great donuts what more could you ask for!"
5 star rating,"Dilla's Delights is definitely a Detroit delight! This establishment EXACTLY embodies Detroit and its vision too, if you ask me. They are locally owned, and the man behind it all has quite the amazing story (He is related to J Dilla).. A craving for donuts lead us here yesterday, and if you're a vegan in this area, you already know how difficult it is to find a vegan donut anywhere! Luckily I was able to try them through uber eats a few months ago, and fell in love.. I mean it is delicious. Usually I am not a fan of raisins but man oh man, even the donuts that had them were so GOOD! I finally had the sweet potato (vegan) one and wow... Blown the hell away. Donuts are not as ""pricey"" because the quality is perfection. They use organic flour, so it is actually fresh. The owner also said he never sells thing a day older! It was my first time going in yesterday and I'm happy I did because I love the whole vibe of the place. It's charming, and the staff seem like genuine good people that you just cannot help but appreciate it. If you're in the area and need a reminder of a Detroit-esque vibe while eating the perfect donuts, this is the place for you!"
5 star rating,"I'm giving more than one star because it was a nice establishment. But these donuts might be the worst I've had, and they aren't cheap either. I tried a cake and a glazed donut. Both were very poorly executed. I do not recommend for donuts."
2 star rating,"I love when I'm greeted with a smile and a positive attitude! Dilla's Delights is definitely a cute little stop in the morning to get caffeinated and grab some donuts. Personally, I was a little bummed of the selection of donuts mainly because I've read so much hype about this donut shop and unfortunately a lot of the options didn't sound as appealing to my kind of taste. One that really jumped out at me was a banana pudding flavor. It was pretty fresh, the taste wasn't over powering of banana, and it definitely made me wanting more. I got a chocolate ""cakeboy"", which was also delicious. I don't visit the area often, but it's definitely a must if you're looking for some good donuts!"
4.5 star rating,"Not only is this restaurant BLACK OWNED...so that's ALWAYS a plus, but the vegan blueberry donut tasted amazing along with the D. Lime Nut Glaze donut.  Friends enjoyed the Chocolate Max and the Lemon Glaze.  This place rocks."
5 star rating,"This is a must-try donut shop! The customer service and their turn top music was fantastic, a tad bit expensive as most vegan and organic places but the donuts are two steps above the competition. Will be returning for sure to try something different. Just wished I took a picture..."
5 star rating,"The lemon filled is the best I've had! Every donut I've tried from here is among the best and Detroit has some steep competition! Solid coffee too and great, friendly staff. Support this place if you're nearby!"
5 star rating,"I was excited to try this donut shop because of all of the positive reviews and fanfare aaand because I love a good donut. I got the apple fritter and the banana donut. I was underwhelmed...very. While it is a good donut, for me...it was nothing special. I liked how there was apple filling in the fritter and you could really taste the banana in the banana pudding donut. Great concept and it's nice that it's organic, but I will continue to funnel my money into Elias Donuts, which is for me the best donut shop I have been to in Detroit."
3 star rating,"Amazing doughnuts, and the owner is a super-cool dude! He told us Stoney's about his life and his family, including his nephew J Dilla, the famous producer that the shop is named after."
5 star rating,"Service was friendly, but selection was limited. I sampled both the chocolate cake donut, which was fine and the glazed donuts, which I found a little disappointing. The texture was heavier and more bread - like than I expected."
3 star rating,"The Vegan blueberry donut was amazing! The donut was cake like, and the glaze was kissed with maple syrup!"
5 star rating,"Best donuts I have ever had! So many flavors, and all so delicious! They even have vegan donuts. We tried two and they were just as delicious as the others. All of our donuts were moist, fluffy, and flavorful. My favorites were lemon and banana pudding. My boyfriend loved the macaroon and cinnamon raisin vegan (he isn't even vegan! )The owner makes all the donuts by hand every night, and he is also the one who serves you. Such a nice guy."
5 star rating,"My favorite donuts in Detroit! Delicious! Organic flour. Vegan options. Love the flavors - lime glaze, pineapple orange, blueberry and more. I could eat a dozen."
5 star rating,"I had the lime glazed doughnut - delicious! Fresh lime in the glaze for an excellent combo of sweet and sour on a fluffy, chewy doughnut."
4.5 star rating,Delicious. We love the lemon filled and the glazed donuts! So happy we have a donut shop in walking distance now.
5 star rating,"Went here for the first time the other morning and not a single thing to complain about. Not only were the donuts as great as I expected but the man working (totally blanking on the name, sorry) was incredibly helpful. He ran me through the history of the shop and we talked music for a little. Such a cool environment and such an amazing way to honor the late and great J Dilla. I'll definitely be back."
5 star rating,Awesome donuts! Some of the best I have had. The shop is next door to 'The Ashley' and close to Comerica. Definitely worth a stop when in Detroit!
5 star rating,Had high expectations and was somewhat disappointed. The location is great and so is the idea. But $2 each for a donut and it better be something special. The donuts were just okay. I hope they can step up their game by making something unique.
3 star rating,"Meh. Agree with Karen A's review. Have been here twice and each experience was disappointing. The customer service was subpar and the donuts just aren't good (really dry/flaky and hard..frankly, I'd rather have two-day old Tim Horton's donuts). I actually threw half of my donut away on both occasions. Really wanted to love this spot, as I do most small Detroit businesses, but it fell way short. Nothing to get excited about."
2 star rating,"These Donuts put both mainstream and ""unique sweets"" style Donuts to shame. While they don't come in ridiculous flavors, the classic ones at Dillas are a HIT. Texturally, these perfect torus shaped balls of fried goodness are the valedictorians of the flavor category. The flavors are simple, refined, and consistent with the Detroit style vibe that this place oozes from every crevice of its interior. They sell out on an instant so I suggest arriving early, will definitely return soon."
5 star rating,"As far as donuts go IMO, there's Krispy Kreme good and now, Dilla's Delights good! Damn good that is!!"
5 star rating,"Love the donuts! First time there today. Got 6 of $10. My daughter has a yeast allergy and Dilla's has yeast free options. She was so excited to be able to have a donut with the rest of the family today. We avoid donuts also because they are typically made with so many unnecessary ingredients and cooked in GMO soy oil, made with conventional wheat (which is tainted with glyphosate) and so on. These were not at all greasy like your conventional donut and made with organic flour. We only tried three of the 6 today and saving the others for tomorrow. Will be back no doubt. Good stuff."
5 star rating,"I was so incredibly excited to visit Dilla's after reading the article written about it on Rolling Stone and it was everything I wanted and more! The donuts and coffee were delicious, the decor was freaking awesome and the man who helped me was great! I would definitely recommend anyone in Detroit visiting Dilla's Delights!!"
5 star rating,"I bought the Fantastic Apple Fritters, Lightworks Lemon Glaze, and I forgot the name of the last one but it had a raspberry filling. I'm not a big donut person, but everything was absolutely delicious and fresh! I'm definitely going to go back to try some of the other flavors they offer!"
4.5 star rating,"Great donuts! Loved the raspberry filled as well as the chocolate covered. Other reviewers have noted the price, but honestly $2 or 3 for $5 is not bad for quality donuts. Also, the staff here is SO friendly. This is a great local business."
5 star rating,"Amazing. Got the chance to meet Uncle Herm and Glen this afternoon - incredible people keeping alive an incredible legacy. What a pleasure it was to meet them and learn a little bit about the history of J. Dilla and of Detroit. And of course, the donuts are absolutely delicious!!"
