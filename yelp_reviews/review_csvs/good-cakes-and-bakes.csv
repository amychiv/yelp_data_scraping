5/10/2022,5 star rating,"I was looking for a place that would deliver some sweets to my Mom for her 94th birthday, and I found Good Cakes and Bakes. I live out of town so I ordered based on the website and reviews, and am I glad I did! They really came through for me. The cupcake order arrived exactly as I had specified, it was delivered on time, and they even included a birthday card for my Mom. Oh, and did I say that she loved the cupcakes (as did everyone she shared them with)? Yes!!"
6/6/2022,5 star rating,"This is one of the most consistent, tastiest bakeries around. Everything I've gotten here has been delicious. I recommend them for just a simple treat to a birthday or any other celebration!!  Love them. The world is a tastier place with them in it!!!"
5/29/2022,5 star rating,"I love this bakery, they offer the best Banana Pudding with and without bananas, I personally prefer the bananas. Healthy vegan choices, amazing cakes, brownies, and much much more, friendly atmosphere, with a soulful vibe for all to enjoy!"
7/31/2021,5 star rating,What a sweet bakery. I was on Instagram and won a free cake Friday. I came down to pick it up and I'm so glad I did. This place is adorable and filled with amazing vegan sweet treats from cupcakes to cakes and more. Sharing some pics of the bakery and also the cake I won.  I also bought a few items to bring to a friends house for dinner so I didn't get to photograph those. I'll be back!
5/29/2022,1 star rating,"My parents ordered a cake for my birthday. They were supposed to pick it up on Saturday but my parents were busy and the store ended up closing. No problem, they should be able to pick it up the next day, right? Nope, the store doesn't open back up until Wednesday. Come Wednesday, the store already threw away the cake and said they don't do refunds nor would they remake the cake for us! This is unacceptable. I've also had stale cake slices from them so if you want to order from them make sure you order a fresh made cake and be on time to pick it up or they won't accommodate"
11/22/2020,5 star rating,I love Good Cakes and Bakes so much! We've had it for a couple of work events pre-pandemic and I've made the drive for their cupcakes every so often since then. I got a few cupcakes this weekend as well as a chocolate chip cookie! So delicious! My favorite cupcakes are the red velvet and the banana pudding! Online ordering for pick up is super easy and their customer service is also great!!
8/22/2020,5 star rating,"This nice bakery has cute outdoor seating where you can eat your goodies. The front door is locked but you can either place an order online or over the phone. When your order is ready, they place it on the table that is near the front door. We got a Strawberry crunch cupcake and a Fruity Pebbles cupcake. They were both good and I liked the fact that they were a normal size with a normal amount of frosting. They were the size that cupcakes used to be when you took them to school to celebrate your birthday. I would love to return when they allow people inside, because it looked nice through the windows."
12/25/2020,1 star rating,"This was my first time trying GCAB and I wanted to support a small, Black owned business to order cinnamon rolls for my family Christmas brunch. In short, I am disappointed. In long -- At least 2 weeks before my desired pickup date (12/24), I called the shop to inquire the best way to place my order. The young lady on the phone told me ordering online was best, so I did just that. I chose my pickup time for 5pm on 12/24 and it was confirmed. The day of pickup, I get a call a little after 3pm stating that my order was still at the shop. I said yes, my pickup time is 5pm. The woman on the phone said no, we closed at 2:30pm today. Well that was news to me! They expected me to drop everything I was doing to come pick up my order ASAP! I let them know I live 30 minutes away and they said someone will be at the shop until 3:45pm giving me exactly 30 minutes from the end of our conversation to get to the shop. Not only is this unfair to me, but it's terrible customer service! I had my whole day planned out around the 5pm pickup time. I can not express my disdain about this situation, especially because it is the first impression. Now let's get to the actual product. When I got home, I was so excited for the cinnamon rolls! They look unappetizing and sunken in. When I had one the next day (12/25), the flavor was underwhelming. Maybe if they were fresh, it would've been better but it could be a lot more cinnamony and indulgent. Nothing to write home about. Overall, I doubt I'll be back. I really wanted to support a small business but it didn't even come close to my expectations or the hype surrounding it. I am a home baker and have made much better baked goods, including cinnamon rolls. I would not recommend ordering from GCAB and I am just so very disappointed about this terrible experience."
2/25/2020,3 star rating,"I have had muffins or cakes from this brand at the farmer's market or somewhere before coming here. They have been featured on the today show. Lots of coffee house style seating. Yes there's a church pew inside. It's a fun looking spot, great marketing, it's everywhere. We got the Apple spice tea, the only herbal tea here, a lemon blueberry loaf and a vegan GF brownie, it looked more moist than the regular gluten brownie. The tea takes a bit to steep. The vegan gf brownie tastes good, just rather dry for me, almost scone like dry. My husband liked it, was too dry for me. I am more of a fudgie brownie fan. The blueberry lemon loaf tastes really nice, would be so much better than the 3 blueberries in the entire loaf though. It was at least nice and moist."
9/1/2019,5 star rating,Ohhhh!!!!!! The LEMON CAKE!!!!I found these two ladies selling amazing looking cakes at the Jazz Festival downtown last Friday and now I am on a mission to get to this store!There were so many other choices on that table and now I wish I'd bought them all.
12/1/2020,3 star rating,"I am an unapologetic caramel cake aficionado, and have been mourning the loss of Reen's Cakes since she decided to retire a few years back. So, to be up front, this is the standard to which I hold caramel cake. And, after trying the caramel cake at Good Cakes and Bakes, I'm still on the hunt for a Reen's replacement. The yellow cake was a bit dry. The frosting as more caramel glaze than caramel frosting, and was pretty thinly applied.  The bakery itself was cute, and the employees friendly and helpful. I'd still give the 7-up cake a try, but I won't be back for the caramel cake. So 2.5 overall, rounded up."
7/18/2021,5 star rating,"My husband ordered me a vegan carrot cake from this bakery for my birthday and it was delicious!! He ordered it through Goldbelly. It arrived on time in a chilled box. We kept it in the refrigerator, ate it the next day and everyone asked which bakery it was from. It wasn't dry or lackluster like other vegan treats. The taste was rich and moist and actually reminded me of a wedding cake. I'd love to try their other vegan baked goods in the future!"
7/10/2019,5 star rating,"Do you need a place that can make cupcakes for your niece's birthday, on short notice, because your oven doesn't work?Do you need a secure place to have packages delivered AND get a yummy treat?Do you want a cozy place to sit and read, or catch up with a friend?Good Cakes n Bakes is for you. (And me, since I've done all of these things there.)And with the upcoming changes to the traffic patterns on the Avenue of Fashion, things are looking even better starting this fall!"
4/5/2021,5 star rating,"I have yet to stop in their brick and mortar, however I find their cake slices at Western Market and boy are they good!  You must try these delicious cakes!  Get a few!  Don't just try one!  Share a few with friends to see which is your favorite, or to have a reason to taste them all!  Support this business not only because their products are amazing, but the owners are job creators, a part of our community, Main Street America, and are the backbone of America!"
11/18/2020,5 star rating,"Minority owned and operated, queer friendly. Coffee is french roast style and there's been a sweet vegan option every time I've gone. I love the setting, lots of natural light and one of a kind details inside. They also have a community bookshelf! Easy access on the lovely chunk of the Livernois corridor."
3/21/2020,5 star rating,"We had April help us out for our cupcake order for our wedding and it was an incredible experience all the way around. First, she had us meet her at her shop and she brought us out little samples of cupcakes, toppings, and fillings. We were able to custom design as many cupcakes as we wanted and it was such a fun experience! If I remember correctly, we chose 8 different varieties and they were a HIT! I received numerous compliments about these cupcakes, but the biggest testaments that they were GONE by the end of the night! We ordered 250 cupcakes and had 175 guests- not one was left! My husband and I didn't even get to eat one but that's okay because our guests were so thrilled. :)Another part of this I must mention is April's willingness to work with us. We found some cupcake holders with beautiful gems on them on Amazon. We had asked if she would be willing to purchase them and we could rent them from her because they matched our wedding decor she much, and she did! It was stunning- all of it. We appreciate you so much, April and all workers at Cakes and Bakes!!!"
8/29/2020,5 star rating,"I want to start by saying that as a business they have done a good job of pivoting during COVID. However, and I really hope that the owners read this review, it feels like the quality of the products and business are slipping. I have been a loyal supporter of GCB. Ordered catering for work events. Cupcakes for my wedding. Made sure to come in and spend during the Livernois street upgrade fiasco and during COVID. I almost always purchase for multiple households just to support the business. But, the last 5 times I've ordered the quality has been...so so. From minor issues with pickup - once a item I ordered was out and I was supposed to be issued a refund, didn't seem to happen. Another time I ordered multiple of the same item but only one was sent with the order. To the bigger and more concerning issue of the products m that used to be delicious seem to just be, ok. I'm not sure if recipes have changed, or access to materials due to COVID - maybe they started using a different brand of flour or butter or eggs...but it's just not the same with their cakes. The taste and order issues have only come up during Covid, except for one catering issue long ago. I love this business and I want to continue to support it, because it's Black owned, because it's LGBTQ owned, because it woman owned, and as a former business owner I know that running a small business in the best of times is hard. I hope that they are able to return to the same amazing quality that brought me to them in the first place. (This is really a 3 star review, but I don't want to yank your yelp rating)"
7/6/2020,5 star rating,I miss my daily commute to working in Southwest Detroit not only because of the loving community but also because I used to be able visit Good Cakes and Bakes on a regular for lunch and sweets!! Love the staff here and the food! I still make my way there just for these sweets and my MIL leaves nearby so that's a bonus too! We love this black owned business!!
3/6/2021,1 star rating,"Very disappointed.  Ordered well in advance for cinnamon rolls.  We were expecting fresh baked but received day old, if not 2 day old cinnamon rolls.  They were extremely dry and hard.  There is hardly any cinnamon throughout the rolls as well."
6/4/2019,4 star rating,"I'm vegan and one of the things that I miss are baked goods like cakes, cookies, pastries, etc that are vegan. When I heard about Good Cakes and Bakes from my wife, I knew I needed to try what this place had to offer. First of all, this place is not a strictly vegan bakery, they have some select items that are vegan. What they did have that was vegan was a few of the cupcakes: the chocolate cupcake and red velvet; the brownies; the chocolate chip cookies, and that was it, I believe. The girl behind the counter was pleasant and nice. We ordered the cupcakes and one cookie which was big, a good size, but thin. The chocolate cupcake was pretty good, it reminded me of a Ding Dong Hostess cake which was pretty impressive to know it was vegan. The red velvet cupcake was good too, but I didn't care for the icing which was a little too sweet for us. But the chocolate chip cookie was so good, it was the perfect balance of sweetness, not overpowering or overwhelming sweet, but just right and the thin texture made it taste great. We came back here a second time for those cookies, but they didn't have it so we had to settle for the red velvet cupcake again. It's a little of the pricey side for each cookie and cupcake. Wish the cupcakes were bigger. Worth coming again for the cookies."
8/14/2020,5 star rating,Great neighborhood spot. Dedicated to the food ecosystem of detroit and offering vegan options. April and Michelle are amazing people and business owners. I've ordered cakes and sweets from them multiple times and they never disappoint.
8/8/2020,5 star rating,"Gold stars for excellent Covid 19 precautions! Order/pay ahead online, or walk up & check the daily posted menu. Call and place/pay for order or tell them you've arrived for your online order. They'll quickly bring your order out when you're there so you can grab it. (These instructions posted clearly at the storefront.)I got a pound cake slice & an ice cream sandwich. Both were amazing! I will definitely be back for more. TIP: if you have nut allergies, be sure to ask about the item you're ordering."
8/3/2020,5 star rating,"These cupcakes are so good! Such fun flavors and they are open and very safe during COVID. I got to the door, called in my order and it was out in less than 5 min. The woman who helped me was friendly and answered all my questions. Got a dozen, loved them all!!"

6/12/2020,1 star rating,"If I could give a zero rating, I would. The cake I received from this place was something that I could've done myself. I am very unhappy with their services from the moment I stepped to the door!My graduation cake was ordered 6/4 and it was told that the cake wouldn't be ready until 6/11 at 1. I arrived at 4:07 on 6/11 to get my cake but for some odd reason the young lady couldn't find my order. So the owner comes to the door and says, ""is it for Dr. such and such, I say yes. Okay, I forgot to put the name on the cake, are you okay with waiting TEN minutes for me to finish this"". Okay, so I waited, the young girl comes back and says ""we didn't have a color for the print, what color do you want""? Okay so by this time I'm really irritated! Twenty minutes goes by, thirty goes by and when it got to 45 minutes, my patience was very thin. So I called to the store to get a refund and as I was calling the young lady brings me the cake. As you can see, there are several issues with this establishment! Well we left with the cake and after traveling back to East Lansing, I realized this cake wasn't what we envisioned it to be. Nevertheless, after cutting the cake there was a beetle like bug in the frosting. This is unacceptable! I will never recommend this place to a dog! The cake is in the trash where this business belongs."
6/6/2020,5 star rating,OH MY GOODNESS!! what is this magic?!? Truly the BEST brownie I have EVER HAD (which is saying a lot) and the cupcakes were divine. I have genuine concern over how many things I need to try here... please take all my money.

3/10/2020,5 star rating,"I saw on IG they were offering a free cupcake today if you showed proof that you voted. That was enough to get me in the door! I've been meaning to get here. SO MANY beautiful cake and cupcake options! Was really hard to pick but I purchased a 3 layer white slice, two cupcakes (one was free) and an outstanding cup of coffee. The 3 layer slice is very light and flavorful. The frosting has a hint of cream cheese but not heavy...I'm addicted.The waitstaff is friendly and the interior is very warm and cozy; feels like a great neighborhood place to hang. The signage is not great but given all the construction along Livernois, I was happy it was somewhat easy to locate.Great spot! My 'free' cupcake cost me $11 of wonderful ness!"

2/5/2021,5 star rating,"I've been wanting to visit Good Cakes and Bakes for a while and finally had a great opportunity. It was about 20 minutes before they closed but they still had a lot of incredible options to choose from - I overindulged! I bought slices of Lemon Velvet Cake, Italian Creme Cake, plus Banana Pudding (with Bananas), two Chocolate Chip Cookies, and Cinnamon Rolls. I was hungry and indecisive - ha! Three of us enjoyed the cake slices for a small birthday dinner that night. The Lemon Velvet was like nothing I've ever had. It was truly so incredibly soft, but with a fresh, lemony flavor. I would have gotten Red Velvet if they'd had it, but am so thrilled they didn't. We could have fought over the Lemon Velvet. The Italian cake was also great - the frosting was so good. I'd been craving banana pudding - haven't had it for decades. This hit the spot. Classic. Made with Chessman cookies (I'm guessing because they fit the container?) instead of Nillas. They were great and helped me with portioning - ha! They offer it with or without bananas. Get this. It makes me want to go back and check out the banana pudding cupcakes!We had the cinnamon rolls in the morning. I thought it was funny that they label banana pudding as with or without bananas - but they snuck raisins into the cinnamon rolls, no warning! So that was a little shocking. My partner loved them so he got mine. Everything else about them was solid. The chocolate chip cookies. Are you kidding me? Back on track. Amazing. Just a super solid, not messing around, ""this is a chocolate chip cookie"" kind of chocolate chip cookie. Dependable, reliable, comfort, chocolate chip cookie. Thank you!!!"

11/29/2019,3 star rating,I feel like if they are not open after the holiday a common courtesy message should have been left on there voicemail instead of what they have..... I came all the way over here to pick up a VERY IMPORTANT PACKAGE only for them to be closed I'm livid .... so obviously if they didn't answer there NOT on another call and it's NOT still normal hours
1/24/2020,2 star rating,"Ok so I had the sweet potato cake and the lemon cake with icing. Both cakes were on the  dry side but not too much.  The sweet potato cake had a nice flavor, but the  lemon cake left a lot to be desired. When tasting a lemon cake one should immediately get that lemon flavor rush that lets you know it's a lemon cake. Wasn't there in this cake. The icing was so so and the cake could  have used a lot more lemon flavor. Well the icing could have too. I want to be able to experience the full flavor not just half of it, which was my experience with this cake. To me they held back which is too bad cause first impressions are everything"

11/29/2018,5 star rating,This will be my go 2 bakery when I need my sweets fix. They have vegan treats here that are so delish. I had the velvet cupcake and chocolate cupcake very moist and flavorful.  I also had the vegan walnut brownie it was ok not as moist as the cupcakes. I will be back to try the vegan carrot cake and more vegan cupcakes
1/8/2020,2 star rating,Cupcakes were just ok...I expected fancier. The vegan one wasn't that tasty. The sweet potatoe soup was good but very bland.

There's lots of vegan options too! Plus some savory foods. Come for any need!"
7/12/2018,5 star rating,"I was here recently for a quick meeting but also to eat some yummy sweets! I'm glad I got a chance to finally go, I've been hearing such great things about this bakery. It's a women owned business. It's a black owned business. And it's in a great part of Detroit that used to be known as, ""The Avenue of Fashion,"" that's definitely making it's own come back. The inside is so bright and colorful, it actually looks sweet inside, like all of their tasty treats :) There's a cool ice cream city painted on the main wall, the chairs are bright green and all the pipes are painted pink, it looks like something out of the game Candyland. The sweets here are never ending! Along the counter they have pound cakes, jars of cookies, candy/cereal bars and homemade oatmeal cream pies. They even had a vegan oatmeal raisin cookie! Behind the counter they have ice cream, coffee, cupcakes and even more take home sweets! I chose a piece of strawberry pound cake that had just a small strip of strawberry on the side, but once I really got in there, it was lots and lots of strawberry swirls all around. It was super soft and sweet but I made sure to stop myself and saved the rest for a late night snack with some almond milk. I loved everything about this bakery, even their lending library, that's a small bookcase that held about 20 books, that you can checkout at their counter. Such a cool idea if you get sucked into a book, while chilling and snacking."
11/8/2016,3 star rating,"My first impression was very positive. I was impressed by the size of the store and it's decor.  It's very welcoming.  There was also a larger variety of choices than I expected.  After asking a few questions, I made my selections. The coconut cupcake was not moist, but the frosting was good.  I won't get a cupcake from here again, but at least I had checked in on Yelp and received $.50 off.  The oatmeal cream pie looked so good, but the cookie part wasn't as fresh as I thought it would be.  The cookie was on the soft side.  The strawberry ooey gooey bar stole the show.  Initially, I wanted the lemon bar but they were still cooling and not ready to be cut.  The strawberry bar was very tasty and just great.  I'll return for it, but hope I can get the lemon flavor. I know it will be even better."
11/14/2019,1 star rating,"I read an article about this establishment, James beard nominee among other things. They support the community and other local businesses.However by far this was the worst service experience I received in my life. I was so frustrated that I decided I would wait a while to make a post but I still feel the same way about the experience.At the time they had 2 phone numbers on their website. 1 didn't work so I let them know, I inquired about a cake and cost. I called them back using the number on the website and they listed the wrong phone number and I had to use my phone history to place my order. Orders need to be placed 72 hours in advance. I placed my order but decided to make a modification and I called and they didn't pick up the phone. I had to go in person to modify my order. Also when I placed my order I was put on hold for several minutes and literally spoke to 4 different people and I still didn't place the order and I had to call back. After having to show up in person to make a change wasn't great but all can be forgiven with a good cake. The establishment is warm and friendly and people are all smiles, which was completely different than the nightmare communication issues. The cake looked good but the cake was dry. I had a triple layer cheesecake and the vanilla cake was dry. I have no intention of ever going back after this terrible communication and average cake. I wish them the best."
11/30/2016,5 star rating,"I had a taste for something sweet and Good Cakes and Bakes is close to home so I stopped by. The interior is inviting-lots of places to sit and be comfortable. The young lady who took care of me was very nice and personable. I got a red velvet cupcake, a cookies & cream cupcake, and (the last piece of) 7up pound cake. Since I felt lucky to get the last part of cake that's what I have eaten so far. I knew I was taking a chance on getting a dry piece. It was close to 6 when I got there and since it was the last piece I knew it had been sitting. I was very pleased. The cake was moist, the flavor was good, and the icing was everything!!  I can't wait to eat my cupcakes!"

We had a delicious cinnamon roll with cream cheese icing, a great way to start the day. But the star of breakfast was the maple bacon biscuit. Wow! It was flaky and buttery without being too heavy or overwhelming. Just perfect. The pastries were so good we grabbed a slice of pound cake for the road, which was the ideal car snack too. On top of the baked goods, the coffee and tea were excellent too - we had the dark roast, along with a cup of black tea.Definitely worth a visit...or many"

6/19/2018,5 star rating,"This place is a must see if you're in Detroit and you have a sweet tooth. They make fresh soups, coffees and baked goods. I wandered in from another restaurant that had a stupendous wait for breakfast. It was bright and so colorful; much like you'd expect a bakery to be.I ordered the soup of the day (collard greens and black eyed peas), a cupcake, rasin roll and a gooey butter strawberry bar. Then I decided to order another cupcake after I tasted the first one (banana pudding). The soup was perfect! It was vegetarian which is a nod to the chef, as most people like to throw meat in peas and greens. There was also pieces of sweet potato in it, too. The balance was amazing. On to the sweets... The frosted raisin roll was warmed for me and melted in my mouth. I couldn't finish it all. The cupcake was a little smaller than the ones I've had at other cupcakeries. Even still, the wafer on top was soft and the inside was moist. There was so much banana flavor that it really did taste like banana pudding. The strawberry goey buttery bar was so sweet, I had to eat it with hot tea. It was delicious,though! Super moist on the inside but had a flaky baked crust on the top and around the edges. Those were my favorite parts. After buying two cupcakes and the bar and soup, the total was 13 dollars. Its refreshing when you indulge in sweets and don't feel bad about spending a ton while doing it. Two snaps up and a cupcake!"

You absolutely are not truthful with what you state.  Firstly, I have no issue with your products, my issue is with your business practice. I have all my emails from you and there is not  anything of what you speak of in your response.I was NEVER told that you had an over abundance of orders, I could be understanding of that. I was never told there would be a delay, you told me since I didn't get my original order for Mothers Day  you would mailin 3 days, still never received. That is why I called and you would not even return my call or answer my email. So, I'm sorry about this incident but I felt compelled to voice my feelings."

My hometown is Detroit so I thought it would be fun to gift my daughter the cupcakes for Mothers Day.  After my order was confirmed, I called because it did not arrive on the specified date. I spoke with April, the owner who said I had to pay separate for shipping which was not stated in my email, so I paid it. I was promised my order would arrive on a certain date again. It did not arrive.  I was promised a 3rd time that she could ship my order on a specific date. After hanging up and thinking about for awhile, I decided not to do business with her at all so I called the bakery, left a message for the owner, April Anderson, she never returned my call, I did state in the voicemail that I wanted a refund because she would not resolve my situation.  Since she would not return my call, I assumed she wasn't going to return my money either so I had to resort to calling PayPal to file a claim to get my money back. She still never called or emailed.I was so disappointed that a business owner would treat their customers with such disregard especially after good reviews which really makes me wonder if they are authentic reviews.Definitely not good business sense or good character."

9/13/2018,5 star rating,Upon entry the aroma of this place is so heavenly. The confectionary selection here leaves you unable to decide. Whatever you choose will not disappoint.
10/8/2019,5 star rating,Love the sweet treats from this fabulous bakery. I live in Chicago where cupcake bakeries are super popular and I wanted to do something special for my Detroit office. The cupcakes were a huge hit. Hoping I can sneak in a last-minute delivery tomorrow.
3/7/2018,5 star rating,"GCB is not only adorable, and a great gathering place, but the offerings are delicious to boot. The vegan cupcakes are insane (red velvet is my fave but they're all good!) We had a sweet potato bundt cake from here at our wedding party and it was a hit. They have Superman ice cream, and many other ice creams. And their banana bread rivals the carefully honed recipe that I make and guard with my life, which is saying something.So it's well worth a stop if you're in the neighborhood, and even worth the drive if you're not!"

6/15/2019,5 star rating,Love this place! Everything I've eaten has been delightful.
3/10/2018,5 star rating,"GCB provides our cakes and cupcakes for our 2015 wedding. We went in for tastings and were able to pick options including vegan options for our guests. We chose GCB for their use of organic ingredients, vegan options, and quality baked goods. GCB fit our idea for simple no fuss cakes that tasted great. So often wedding cakes are beautiful but taste terrible. Our dessert table was a hit - not a crumb left behind!"
6/6/2020,5 star rating,OH MY GOODNESS!! what is this magic?!? Truly the BEST brownie I have EVER HAD (which is saying a lot) and the cupcakes were divine. I have genuine concern over how many things I need to try here... please take all my money.
1/27/2018,5 star rating,Loved that she had several different options! I'd been back multiple times and thoroughly enjoyed each option! LolI would go again but I'm no longer living in freezing cold MI! Mad about missing the delicious treats...not the weather though!I will! Thanks for the invite!
6/3/2016,5 star rating,"So yesterday after hearing Tracey ask about going to this place for the 100th time, we finally made it to Good Cakes and Bakes after work. As a fellow baker I must admit, I was in no rush to go because normally you realize they are using boxed cake recipes doctored up. After reading some reviews and Tracey asking again, let's just get it out the way.   Well the first thing i realized is how much has changed in the Livernois and 7 mile area. Kuzzo's Chicken & Waffles restaurant was jam packed at 9am. Flagship Clothing Store had some nice things on display in the window and the area really seemed alive. It was a very nice thing to see as the location is nowhere near the always hustling and bustling downtown Detroit area.    Good Cakes and Bakes is located at 19363 Livernois, again, right next to Kuzzo's Chicken. They open daily at 9 am and we were there at 9:05 with a fully stocked store. First things first, the store smells AMAZING. Imagine the smell of Pineapple Upside Down Cake mixed with Caramel Cake mixed with Strawberry Cake mixed with Banana Pudding cupcakes all in one room! Man oh man! Heavenly! Also, they specialize in organic and vegan  (Karol and Marci) as well.   There is a large seating area that is very comfortable and inviting. They hold community meetings every Sunday addressing issues in and around the community. For this reason they are normally closed on Sunday to allow time for these meetings. I could go on and on about the things going on here, but lets get to the real reason we are here, the food.   I am a baker myself, so I will be the FIRST to admit I judge a little harder on cakes and pastry places, so if i say it's good, it's GOOD! Good Cakes and Bakes gets a standing ovation from me. I ordered the Pineapple Upside Down Cake and a Oatmeal Cookie sandwich. Let's start with the sandwich.   Oatmeal cookies is a surprisingly difficult thing to make. Sure you can make them, but can you get the flavors to pop as a cohesive unit? That's the magic with oatmeal cookies and Good Cakes and Bakes was dead on with it. You get a taste of cinnamon, raisin, oatmeal, touch of nuts and everything in between times 2 since it's a sandwich. Then add to that a not overly sweet creamy filing in the middle. OH MY! I ordered this as my snack in the car home. After first bite it became a instant classic. This my friends is a MUST BUY!   After falling asleep and waking up with the beautiful taste of oatmeal cookie sandwich in my mouth, I knew i had to try my Pineapple Upside Down cake. I opened the canister and immediately noticed how moist the cake was. Very moist with an awesome aroma.    Here is what i truly liked about the cake. While it is a bundt cake, every layer is a different texture. The bottom was soft and moist with a minimum amount of pineapple flavor. The middle had a slight crunch to it and the pineapple flavor picked up in intensity. The top layer simply slapped you with pineapple flavor and had a beautiful golden brown color. Wanna know what the best part of this cake was? The aftertaste! Man the aftertaste is phenomenal! You ever had cake that was good, but you wanted to drink milk or something soon after? Not this cake, you want that flavor to sit there as long as possible. This cake was perfectly created in every way.   Good Cakes and Bakes has a lot of good things going for it. Great location? Check. Extremely knowledgeable and friendly staff? Check, but the biggest check they have simply speaks for itself, the cakes and bakes. I encourage ALL my Chompers to check them out.  Grades are in the comments section. P.S. Shout out to the cashier in training. You have that job because you are good at what you do. Don't worry! :-)#Foodie #FoodPorn Follow #CharlieChompsAmerica on Facebook for more reviews"
4/3/2017,4 star rating,Ooey Gooey Butter Cake.Just.I have no idea if anything else is good. I'm sure it is. But this cake! Think chess pie but in a cake. Don't think. Just get it.
12/7/2017,4 star rating,"Enjoyable spot for an ooey gooey bar or vegan cupcake. The caramel cake has been my favorite so far. I love the community aspect of Good Cakes and Bakes. They host small business activities, have previously been a warming location when it was freezing last winter and other unique ways to be about the community that they are in on Livernois.  It's an open, accepting space for patrons. I have been to a small book signing and a coloring book premiere for a local entrepreneur. Each event was nice and inviting. Good Cakes and Bakes is more than a bakery based on the experiences that I have had."
9/22/2018,5 star rating,A spectacular family owned bakery that stole my heart. The cookies and cream vegan ice cream is to die for. It's a special gift to be served delicious treats by people who love what they do.
11/4/2019,5 star rating,"Every cupcake I've eaten here is stupid good. Lemon cupcake? Delicious!! Strawberry cupcake? Phenomenal!! Salted caramel vanilla? Superb!! Regular vanilla? Lovely!! Point is make a stop into this place, the only thing you will regret is not being able stop yourself from shoving these cupcakes in your face."
8/20/2016,4 star rating,"I stopped in to check out this new bakery and I loved it! The staff was pleasant, the decor and music were fun and inviting and my french-pressed coffee was pretty good. I would definitely come back to try some of the sweets!"
4/2/2016,5 star rating,"Best carrot cake EVER, and it's vegan AND soy free !!!  And all items are soy free, bonus. Looking to try the vegan brownies soon."
11/10/2018,2 star rating,"I live nearby, and I was hoping that this venture would be good since so few people are taking the plunge to provide the west side with something other than car washes, liquor stores and churches, but unfortunately what I had, which was a coconut cake obviously came from a box and was dry as sawdust.  For some reason, the locals here believe that real baking is baking from a box.  It's silly provincial foolishness, and.... it tastes bad.  This kind of thing should be obvious, but I guess it's not.  Too bad.  Buy some real flour, eggs and butter.  Not too complicated."
5/6/2018,5 star rating,This is my favorite bakery in the city. The baked goods taste like a big bite of grandma's cooking. Everything is pure buttery sugary delight. I'll sing your praises every day. I love this place.
4/23/2017,5 star rating,"Shockingly good. We sampled multiple treats, including the gooey cake and different ice creams, and it was all fantastic. Took ice cream and the apple cheesecake to go. The cheesecake was like an apple crumble/apple pie/cheesecake combo. Yum! Also great service. Highly recommend. We will be back."
3/14/2017,5 star rating,This is a gem - coming from NYC where bake shops are a dime a dozen the caliber of the cake stands out everything done to perfection THIS PLACE DESERVES 10 STARS
4/13/2018,2 star rating,"This bakery came highly recommended after asking around for a bakery to do a personalized cake. I came to April with a very specific design for my friend's birthday.  I only wanted a small cake To feed about 4 people. I was told, since my design was so intricate and specific, I had to go up one size in cakes. That was fine because I wanted the design. We drafted and agreed upon a design and color. I was charged a design fee and of course had to spend More money since I had to have a larger cake. The day I went to pick up the cake, the cake was nothing that we agreed upon. I believe firmly that it's all about the recovery. April was very defensive and argumentative, as if I personally offended her about her work. I was not offered a remake, a refund for my design fee or the difference in the amount of the cake siZes. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I will avoid this place at all costs and encourage those I know to do the same."
7/14/2016,5 star rating,I had what a thought was a slice of coconut cream cake but it turned out to have pineapple too!  It was the best cake I have had in a long time.  I would say to skip the cupcakes and grab a slice of cake.  $4.00 for a giant slice that lasted for two desserts is a great deal.  TRY THIS PLACE....my next special occasion will definitely have a cake from here!!
4/29/2017,5 star rating,"Only place where I order the vegan cupcakes, not because they're vegan, but because I like them even more than the normal ones! And that's not easy, because the normal ones are excellent."
7/27/2018,5 star rating,This place should be called Great Cakes and Bakes because it is just that. Friendly staff too.
12/30/2015,5 star rating,"Any good cake or bake requires the right mix and ingredients coupled with the right temperature and time. Sure everybody knows that right?! Perhaps, but what Good Cakes & Bakes incorporates in every single cake, pie and cupcake is a secret ingredient, that I refuse to divulge except to say it rhymes with ""Dove"" and starts with a ""L"" and that's all I am saying! Mix that with being a place where the community can come together in the most whimsical environment and service that makes you feel as if you're sitting at your grandmothers table then you have receipt for Good Cakes & Bakes! While I certain don't ""need"" a thing out of here, I make it a point to drive from the east side of Detroit for the reasons I mentioned above. Do yourself a favor. Toss caution and diet to the wind, and have a dozen of cupcakes! Your tummy and fitness instructor will thank you!Go!"
8/11/2014,5 star rating,I stopped in Good Cakes and Bakes on a whim. The eatery is cozy & a perfect meeting spot. Everything looked delicious & it was a hard choice but once I saw the sweet potato cake I was sold. It was moist and the icing a perfect combination of sweet & creamy. I bought goodies for my family and they loved every bite.The owner was personable & patiently answered every question I had about ingredients & preparation. I look forward to many more visits to Good Cakes & Bakes
11/20/2016,5 star rating,"Went here for the first time recently. Didn't even know they were there. The cupcakes were pretty good. Carrot cake not so great, but not horrible. The service was exceptional. The environment was serene and peaceful. I'll definitely be going back."
9/29/2016,5 star rating,This place is a gem. The owner's mom was running things this Sunday when I walked in with a friend. It instantly puts you in a good mood! At least that's what it made me feel. Beautiful and colorful and don't even start me on the cupcakes! The coffee was great too but that banana pudding cupcake!!! I'm day dreaming about it right now.
2/4/2016,5 star rating,"I am a big fan of this bakery, the service is great, atmosphere is funky, fresh, and warm all at the same time, and lastly the sweets are on point.  I have had the pleasure of meeting and talking with the owner April on several occasions and she couldn't more pleasant and a joy to talk too.  If you are looking for a bakery in Detroit, or have a sweet tooth and looking for something great, go to Good Cakes & Bakes!"
1/8/2016,5 star rating,"I love the cupcakes, coffee, and ice cream at GCAB. In addition to the sweet treats I also love the atmosphere and the young students during the summer that work behind the counter. I've been here many times. My favorite cupcakes are the blueberry, banana pudding and of course the red velvet. The ice cream is organic and it always taste super fresh, is never to firm or too soft. My favorite ice creams are the superman and the bubblegum flavored. GCAB is a great place to read a book, surf the web, or to have a meeting. A true gem to the Ave."
12/30/2015,5 star rating,"From the first time I tried the baked goods in this bakery, I was hooked. That was over a year ago. You can just tell the baker, April, loves what she does. On top of that, she uses organic products. So amazing and this was so needed in Detroit. The atmosphere in the establishment makes you just want to come back, over and over again. Bravo!!!"
12/9/2016,1 star rating,"The worse experience I have had with a Bakery at home. This bakery did not show up for my wedding in Detroit, MI 11/25/16. My wonderful planners had to go to another vendor 30 minutes before the reception began to order cake and cupcakes. This company also used my credit card to pay their ATT bill and purchase Hunter Boots a week later. (After disputing the charges with Amex, I received the copy oft the statement that AT&T provided American Express this morning. The AT&T account is in the name of Good Cakes and Bakes.) This is fraud. So much for supporting local black businesses.  I will report this accordingly."
11/15/2014,1 star rating,"If you want a quick dessert bite, sure go to them.If you want a respectable bakery that cares about their clients and patrons, you may want to walk the other way. I trusted this bakery for one of the most important days of my life, my wedding. And sadly, this place is what led to my tears on the wedding day. I wanted cupcakes (with a top tier cake). Cute. Dainty. But with limited frills. Got the idea off pinterest, and the lead baker April committed to doing it. Only until the week before my wedding did I start to realize she wasn't truly capable of delivering the vision I shared with her. Still I had hope. 3 hours before my wedding, my wedding planner and hostesses had to run around to local grocery stores and a Michaels to try to fix what she delivered (I will send pictures to anyone who is interested). The reality is.. it was too late. and my wedding cupcakes were awful. What's even more frustrating is immediately after the wedding she spoke to my assistant and agreed to reimburse half, I was fine with that because I do recognize her cost of goods (trying to be understanding). But then, she backpedaled and has since avoided my phone calls and emails. I'm disappointed. and writing this review to hopefully help anyone who may be interested in this place for something special in your life. Just don't do it."
2/11/2015,5 star rating,"I love this place!  April's red velvet cakes have won rave reviews at my son's birthday parties where the parents have marveled that their kids ate the cake itself - not just the frosting. She uses organic ingredients and no dyes - so those delicious red velvet cupcakes have no food coloring, just the old-fashioned and natural ingredients.  Cupcakes are delicious, gooey butter cakes are delicious, brownies are delicious but my most favorite item is so simple: lemon blueberry pound cake.  I sincerely appreciate that this business is in my neighborhood and helping to revitalize the Avenue of Fashion.  April and Michelle are just the nicest people that you ever want to meet and our visits are part social/ part sweet tooth fulfilling.  They have a lending library and a play area for kids.  The murals make the place bright and fun so taking a small child there for a cupcake is more than just a sugar rush but also can be a special treat kind of activity.Go!  You won't be disappointed."

11/23/2016,1 star rating,First and last time here. Ordered a special birthday cake for my son showed up at 11:30am was told it would be ready at 3:30.  Hours on the door say open until 8pm showed up at 5:15pm doors locked. No where on door did they have a sign saying closing at 4pm. They opened up only to tell me that they didn't have the cake didn't know where it went!!!! Unreal never going back not well run.
11/26/2015,5 star rating,Awesome bakery with delicious desserts (try the rum cake or gooey butter cake) and great tea!!
2/10/2017,5 star rating,"The best vegan treats I have ever had in my life!! The vegan carrot cake looked amazing, but tasted even better. I can't even describe how delicious it was. I also had two vegan cupcakes....the frosting was so yummy and the cake was so moist. The presentation is beautiful. I can't wait to order from them in the future for events. Delicious and adorable inside. Only draw back is the lack of parking (went during lunch rush and chicken place next door is busy), but not a big deal and totally worth it. Prices are good too."
1/28/2018,5 star rating,"If you are looking for something vegan they have the absolutely best vegan carrot cake.  My daughter is allergic to dairy: anything with caisen or whey. I have tried cakes from every where I can find. According to her this is the best. Plus the rest of there baked goods are amazing.  Sit down and have their french press coffee, awesome as well and try anything, everything I have tried is great."
4/14/2018,5 star rating,"This is a casual bakery with some limited seating BUT-- the casual vibe fools you because this is a high-end bakery!! The red velvet cake is to die for! Wonderful daily selections- don't miss the rolls, if you get a chance. Worth a drive if you're not even in the area."
5/16/2015,1 star rating,"As I sat here eating our sweetheart cake from one year ago, I started to reminisce about how fun that day was, including all the mishaps. And then, I sourly remembered the whole cake fiasco. If it wasn't for all the events that proceeded and the unprofessionalism of the owner, trust me, I wouldn't take the time to write this review.Back in the planning days, my husband approached April, whose bakery we found through the blog, Love in the D. He provided photos of cakes with an ombre/color-gradient style, documented via email. We asked for ruffles and for a coral/pink ombre, acknowledging that she does cakes with organic ingredients. She said that she could do it but suggested buttercream instead of fondant as a cost and time-saving measure. She assured us that she would be able to provide the colors we asked for. Come wedding day, we noted that the cake and cupcakes all white with a bright-blue fondant ribbon. ""Oh, she couldn't do it. Oh well, she didn't do it,"" were my initial thoughts, but I quickly brushed them aside as I needed to do some serious dancing with my husband. A short time later, we received an email with her asking for return of the cupcake stand. My husband asked the mother-in-law to comply with the request. Unfortunately, my husband's grandmother suffered a severe stroke a week before our wedding. With the amount of care and decisions needing her attention, the stand was forgotten. We were unaware, but I know we were remiss. Then, the second email came:"".... I hope you are a man of your word and you will reply to this email. Didn't I keep my part of the agreement and deliver your cupcakes and sweetheart cake? Didn't I give you the design you wanted?? I would appreciate a response to this email within the next few days.""It was the way she addressed my husband that made me so angry- the audacity of questioning our integrity with her lack professionalism instigated my quick reply. Simply put, the answer to her rhetorical questions was a tangible ""no."" I pointed out her rudeness and her incompetence to complete our request that I wasn't even upset about until her immature behavior. Her response was that the white cake was the design she was given, which we shot down immediately with evidence of pictures sent via email on the night of purchase. She began to backtrack and apologized for the words exchanged. We promptly returned the stand.We had many wonderful vendors working with us- not all were perfect but they were professional. April, I've waited a full year to write this, but I hope you have developed your listening skills in the interim. Your cake was delightful but the aftertaste was not."
10/19/2014,5 star rating,"saw a few ppl on my facebook who go to GCB brunch on sundays then saw that they have a poetry/spoken word night every 3rd Saturday of the month so I figured I would check them out along with my friend. SOO glad I did. it's very easy to find on livernois next to a cleaners. parking was limited so I drove around a few times before deciding to park across the street in a parking lot. it's very brightly lit from the street with open windows which seem to invite you in. walking in is a whimsical artsy feel to it with bright colors and swirls and a huge chalkboard cupcake. I like the benches and easy tables. very organic looking. a little library and art shop. walked right up to the counter and was spoken to by a friendly face. her name was april. I asked about the vegan options and immediately got the red velvet. um. hello. so freaking moist. and the thing about vegan that some can't get correct is moist cake as well as moist frosting. sometimes, the frosting is hard and stiff on the outside but as you eat, the layers underneath is soft. OH not so at GBC, the frosting was moist and soft from the start and I was soo happy about it. the cake wasn't dense AT ALL and it didn't stick to the paper which means I wasn't wasting food. I also got the vegan vanilla bean and have no complaints. my friend got the coconut, carrot, and oh german chocolate and she had no complaints either. took home a german chocolate and a banana pudding for my sister and god-niece. ooh, I like that they had their niece at the register. she was cute. very family friendly and inclusive. I wish I drank coffee/tea because the packaging looks fun and may very well be tasty as the baked goods... but that has nothing to do with them, I just don't drink it.I didn't feel out of place or like I shouldn't be there. very welcoming and open. I wish I got the name of the other woman who was behind the counter, she was cool too. the whole sweet speak poetry night was awesome and people were buying steadily. they even offered a by one get one free at the end of the night. they provide customer service the right way. they are on our radar to cater a bridal shower with both vegan AND non vegan options. I mean, that says a lot!if you haven't checked them out, I highly recommend and suggest that you go to GCB. there is a reason why they get top stars. quality food. quality people. and we will be back. monthly...and brunch fo sho...."

6/12/2016,1 star rating,"Horrified and Displeased with custom cake and service!!!This two tier, two tone, custom cake fail was supposed to be the showpiece of the dessert table at our daughter's ""Rites of Passage"" ceremony.  We called the store two hours before closing time and the cake was still not complete.  My husband arrived after closing time to pick-up the cake, and when he saw the finished product stuffed into a donut type cake box with saran wrap taped across the box....his heart was shattered.  The cake was a solid color not two tones, with light spot drippings around it, the short cake stick was visible, the cake was slightly slanted, the icing was thin and a somewhat burnt looking cake was peeping through it,  and the icing designs were sliding down the tier.  Sadly, we were very humiliated and way too mortified to display this thing at our daughter's gala....we tried calling the store and the baker April(co-owner) would not respond to our calls or text messages.  However, the baker did send an email reply stating that she would refund us for the epic cake fail.... which we still have yet to receive.  Never ask this baker to use their creativity, and next time....use a more experienced baker for your sentimental occasions....Regretful for ever doing business with this establishment!"
9/26/2015,5 star rating,This place was a great find. I had a salted Carmel cupcake and a gooey bar. Both tasted clean and didn't being me down like those grocery store cupcakes. It is a bit pricey but I guess organic ingredients carry that overhead everywhere.
