3/22/2022,5 star rating,"I love Kuzzos Chicken & Waffles. Everything about this place is amazing. I get the half & half iced tea & lemonade to start, he gets the 3 flavor Kool-Aid. The drinks are served in a quart Ball jar, they're extra large and last forever. :) It's always difficult for me to choose which dinner to get, but it is always along the lines of chicken & waffles. There are many different variations, and the chicken is so good. It's nice and juicy with a crispy, salty flavored crunchy outside- the perfect combination. The waffles are made to perfection. They're the thinner type, served with a huge dollop of whipped butter. I opt for the hand cut fries- the perfect accompaniment- along with a side of mac-n-cheese & cornbread muffin to finish it off. I always need to box up some food, the portions are large. I look forward to dining at Kuzzos. It's always a pleasure!"
1/14/2022,3 star rating,"I had just arrived in the city and was craving a ""soul food"" brunch spot. I was sold when I saw chicken and waffles. I ordered the red velvet waffle with chicken tenders which was a solidly good choice. The waffle was perfectly cooked (not too hard or too soft) but was hoping for a stronger red velvet flavor. It was also missing the cream cheese glaze. The tenders were hot, a nice size, and well seasoned.To be honest, I feel my rating is based off of my item selection. I had no clue about how massive and eye catching the koolaids were! The waiter mentioned koolaid, I saw the price for $4 and said... um no thanks. We were the first party at the restaurant (weekday morning) so it wasn't until I was leaving and I saw people with them I knew I made a mistake. I also wasn't in the mood to drink yet, but would for sure try one spiked! Last wish is that I wish I would have grabbed one or 2 sides to try. I'll definitely be back, but I'll make sure to come thirsty and order sides."

3/19/2022,2 star rating,The food and customer service here has changed. I placed an order through doordash pickup. I guess they assumed that it would be a dasher coming to pick up the order. They gave me these small tenders and two were dry and it looked like it was cooked in old grease. I made sure to check my food while inside. I stood at the bar waiting on someone to come over. The lady who brought my food was the only one that came to ask what was wrong. My food was remade but the old chicken shouldn't have been given to me in the first place. If placing an order to go check your food before leaving.
3/8/2017,4 star rating,"I came here with my friend. The wait was about 20 minutes. We were seated at the bar because those were the only seats available. I ordered the red velvet i believe. This was my first time here, the mason jars made me feel at home. The food did take a while but it was delicious."
5/3/2022,1 star rating,Everything is poor. The service is the worst you'll ever experience. They don't clean the waffle makers at all. Waffles taste like old grease. Disgusting! They do everything bad. The worst place to ever visit. Don't go! Don't do it! Save yourself from the disappointment. They take your cash and refuse to  give your change. Don't subject your money to this place please run away. Look away find somewhere else to eat I beg you lol.
9/18/2021,4 star rating,"I'm visiting Michigan and my cousin wanted to try chicken and waffles for the first time. We found this place and took a chance. Parking was surprisingly available across the street, which hasn't been our experience in Detroit. We walked in and waited to be seated for about 5 minutes. A line began to form behind us and there was a line of people waiting to pick up their food inside by the bar. Several staff walked past us and I thought to myself, bad customer service. We eventually were seated and waited to order. It looked like there was only one server because he was attending to every table. Obviously they were short staffed. Our waiter, Marlon was very nice and when he eventually got to us, he apologized for the delay. We ordered the:-Shrimp n Grits: Shrimp was pretty good, grits were okay but my friend who is originally from South Carolina said they were amazing. So maybe take his word for it. -Big Mamas: The chicken was well seasoned and moist. For my sides, I choose collard greens (a bit salty), mac n cheese (yum!) and candied yams (delicious). As I type this, I'm realizing they forgot my cornbread. Insert sad face here. -Big Red: The waffle was huge and fluffy. Wings were great too. 4 stars because the service could have been better. But our food came quick and it was tasty. What else could you ask for?"
8/4/2021,4 star rating,"By all the reviews... you pretty much now know the legend of Kuzzos... the food can sometimes be great!  The service can sometimes be okay as well... probably never exceptional... but come at the wrong time and you may be waiting a year before you get food. I felt like I should review because they are a metro Detroit staple for chicken n waffles.I have gone many times because it's conveniently close, but ALSO I had to admit to myself that no matter how many times I waited my whole life to get some food here.... I really like their chicken and waffles... whether it be the big red or the regular waffle and the tenders.  I can't touch the sides or the kool-aid/sweet tea/lemonade... the sides are heart attack worthy, buttered up and sugared up.  The drinks are like 80% sugar.  And the alcoholic bevs are not what you would call top of the line, but the prices hit for around $13-$15 a drink.My advice?  The closer you go there during non peak times, better chance of your service being decent.  If it looks like there are a lot of people there, just wait to get your fix another day.  For food... keep your order simple, get chicken n waffles, drink some water with it, or get a beer, or some wine.... No house drinks.  If you do those things you should get decent food and service with a pretty good price... go outside of those parameters, you're playing with fire. Good Luck!"
7/16/2021,5 star rating,"Kuzzo's has been on my radar but every visit to The D, I somehow run out of time. Not this time tho - made it to Kuzzo's and it didn't disappoint! Love the decor both inside and outside (yes even the lil bench outside is cool and you can get a good pic with the restaurant as your background). Lots of dope artwork inside of some of your fav artists: Danny Brown, Whitney Houston, John Witherspoon (Pops Williams aka Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang LOL!), Common, and Diana Ross. The neon What Up Doe sign is such a cute accent and SO Detroit!Although I was a bit disappointed by my drink - I came for the Spiked Koolaid that is the pretty blue, yellow, green layered colors on so many TikToks, but apparently that is only the virgin version (no thanks! lol) - the food did make up for it! Hazel's Southern Platter with Catfish was the move since they don't allow substitutes and I really wanted a red velvet waffle with the New Wave (2 pieces of catfish and a regular waffle). The catfish is HUGE - you will definitely be taking a to go box. The mac & cheese and collard greens were yummy as well although the sides could stand to be a little bigger. Breakfast is served all day as well - such a great offering!Kuzzo's lives up to the family feel and your belly full just like leaving ya Nana's house. Can't wait to return and the fact that it's a black-owned business makes me want to continue to support!"
5/12/2022,5 star rating,"I come here at least once every two weeks. The food is good, the drinks are strong, the vibe is excellent, and the staff are friendly. Great black owned business."
2/24/2022,4 star rating,"I ate here on 2/24/22, the food was real good . Only recommend that the restaurant goes back to the thick waffles they had when they first open. Can't eat a waffle that's thin as a piece of bacon. Yea"
5/22/2022,5 star rating,"i had a great time at this restaurant! i haven't been in a while but was visiting detroit so i said why not? the food and drinks were so good. we had a really great waiter, she was sweet and helped us with anything we needed. i wish i would've gotten her name, anyways 10/10! i would recommend coming here."
4/26/2022,4 star rating,"Great restaurant for some good comfort food and a drink if you like. Food is great, staff is pretty good too. The only complaint I have is some of the waitresses get the automatic gratuity so they don't check in on you as often for drinks."
7/9/2021,5 star rating,"Went here again and everything was delicious. The Kool-Aid is very sweet, so you might want to water it down some, but otherwise, very good."
5/27/2018,5 star rating,"So far, soooooooo good! I've been there a couple of times and had a variety of entres just to compare. The chicken and waffles are divine. The waffles are homemade and the chicken is full of flavor. The shrimp and grits are really good too! These are just a few things you can try, but overall, Kuzzo's is now one of my favorite restaurants."
1/29/2022,1 star rating,"By far the slowest worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. When we (4 people) sat down we were going to be moved to a booth but there was a huge spill under it. After seeing the huge red spill we decided to just stay seated where we were at a table. We pointed it out to the staff and she rudely said ""well I'm not going to clean it"" the spill was cleaned nearly 45 minutes later and they tried to sit two parties there wile the spill was still there ruining their shoes. We sat for 25/30 minutes before we were greeted by our waitress where her greeting was ""you ready?"" We ordered our food and drinks at the same time and waited 25 more minutes for 4 sodas.  She avoided us the entire time while waiting for food it started to come out 45 minutes after the drinks. Half of our table was served and then it took around 10-15 more minutes for the rest of the food to come out with no explanation or apology. The Mac and cheese is oily and obviously microwaved. They ran out of fries and one of the baskets was obviously frozen fries out of a bag. The chicken was the only redeeming thing but it was on the dry side. We had to ask for ketchup 3 times and refills twice. The food was far to mediocre to be treating your customers this way. Fix your customer service!"

5/4/2022,5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing chicken and waffles! It was hot and just popping with flavor, so tasty! The service was phenomenal and everyone was such a delight! Highly recommend and we will be back many times!"
5/23/2022,5 star rating,"Sorry I did not take a picture but the pictures already posted are accurate.  We walked in and was greeted by the sweetest young lady. It was crowded so we sat at the bar. The server asked if we wanted a drink while we waited. My husband and I are not drinkers AT all but we thought what the heck and we allow her to choose a drink for use. When I tell you she made that drink I mean she did not hold back.  When a table opened up at the window we sat and watch the comedy show going on outside lol. The service was slow but well worth the wait. I had fried chicken, greens, mac and cheese and cornbread. My husband had 2 huge catfish filets fried and seasoned to perfection, sweet potatoes, and Mac and cheese. We could not eat it all so we enjoyed it for lunch the next day. I suggest getting there early or ordering take-out if you are in a rush. If you have time have a drink and enjoy some good comfort food. The staff is pretty nice too."
8/1/2021,1 star rating,"Leave your house with a full stomach if you're coming here to eat! We couldn't get past the terrible service to even try the food! This place came recommended by someone who kept hearing about it but never got to experience it themselves. It was a Sunday, it was packed and everyone dining was black so of course that's a good sign of the food being good.At first, we were seated outside, 2 adults and a baby. We asked for a high chair and were told that the high chairs are more suitable for their indoor tables which were lower. I told them it was fine, that my child would sit on my lap. We ordered our food. The drinks came and we waited. Eventually, dark clouds started to roll in. It started to rain so we moved indoors and waited. I couldn't help but notice how attentive the other waiters were to their tables. Why isn't our waitress as communicative? 45 minutes and a change of scenery later, we're questioning where our food is. ""Let me go check"" is what we kept hearing until it turned into ""they say 5 minutes"". It was when the table next to us that arrived 20 mins after us got their food before us, i walked up to the hostess because again...where is our waitress? I asked her what was going on, that the table next to us got there food before us and if me going back there would help my food come out faster. She told me that they said 5 minutes and so its 5 minutes. She can't make the food come out faster and it's not her fault (making it about her), i can leave if i want to. I immediately respond telling her i know it's not her fault. I'm just trying to figure out what I need to do in order to get my food. In this conversation, she tells me that I can leave if I want to three times. I take this as a sign that I'm not wanted here, so I walk over to my table to leave. At this point I'm disgusted. My appetite disappears and I want nothing to do with the place. As I pick up my child, guess who shows up with our food?The waitress asks are you guys leaving? I said yes, she said okay and walks away with casualness -- a sign that this happens all the time. Takeaways: - leave the house full if you're coming to eat here- don't expect basic level service- the water they serve automatically is trash- your waitress may or may not even know what sangria is- food could be delivered at very different times at same table- the hostess is quickly offended- not clear why the manager even isWill be giving them a call to speak with the manager but truly i have doubt they'd even care.Update: i called and left a message for the manager. I left my phone number twice in the message. It's been two weeks and they have not called back"
2/3/2022,3 star rating,"Kuzzos has some great food on their menu, I always get the new wave. That's the catfish & waffles. Staff is cool and place is fairly clean. If service was any faster I would give them 5 stars but it is what it is. I would recommend this place no doubt, but be prepared to wait. although I must say sometimes you get lucky with faster service depending on the day."
8/1/2021,1 star rating,"Listen. I know I'm to be patient during busy times but we waited over an hour to be seated because the waitress forgot to call us when our table was ready. Since we had so much time waiting we already knew what we wanted to eat as soon as we sat down. We ordered immediately and it took over an hour for us to get our food. Then when we did get our food we had no silverware and had to try to flag our rude waitress down to get silverware (after asking two other waitresses for silverware as well) By the time we were able to eat we had cold food. We also had no napkins, no salt/pepper, or anything at the table. This place is no good. You know what the worst part is? These people have the nerve to automatically charge 20% gratuity for piss poor service."
2/6/2022,1 star rating,"I just flew into the city and driving through my childhood neighborhood to see all the great changes on Livernois. I decided to drop in for brunch. BIG MISTAKE.Read these reviews and it sounds like a pattern. Poor, non-attentive service and awful food. It took 10 minutes for anyone to take my order, and another 20 min for my food to arrive. I ordered toast,  chicken omelet, homestyle potatoes and cranberry juice. The toast was the best part and it was barely heated. The omelet was terrible; the chicken was overcooked and poorly seasoned. I guess that is because the grease they cooked it in tasted old as well. The homestyle potatoes were lukewarm and drenched in pepper; just awful.My server never came by to see how my meal was, never gave me a detailed bill. I never received the cranberry juice and realized after I left I was charged for it as I did not receive a detailed bill.  I ended up spending the next 90 minutes walking as much as I could to digest this meal as I felt I was going to be sick if I didn't. It was nice to see a new business in my neighborhood, but unfortunately they won't see me again. I was better off going to the McDonalds up the street. Eat elsewhere."
1/15/2022,2 star rating,"I stopped by Kuzzos for a bite to eat during COVID (Aug 2020). I know it was risky business, right?! It's Kuzzos so it's worth it (or at least I thought). As I first met by the server, she didn't have a mask. Then she spewed hot fire breathe like Dylan when she spoke to us. We just thought it was a slip but then we seen her hop behind the bar and started mixing the drinks with no mask on. We waited over 45 mins for our food before we decided to cancel the order and leave. The food is excellent but the service is trash. I only recommend dine-in if you have 1.5/2 hours to kill."
4/16/2022,1 star rating,"I am new to the state of Michigan. My now husband introduced me to Kuzzos.  Initially I loved it and we took my family there when they came to town. I always ordered the catfish and waffles with grits (when they aren't runny).  I was initially excited to eat at Kuzzos!!! The food quality and service has seemed to take a deep nose dive during the course of a year.  Once when we dined there, one of the kitchen staff (young guy) came out of the kitchen, on his phone,  with his pants mid butt cheek, exposing underwear.  I was really disgusted with that.  The last time we reluctantly attempted to dine in on 4/14/22. We waited to be acknowledged while standing in front of the hostess stand... several severs came by but no one acknowledged us or at the very least spoke to us. Finally talk to someone. Ok... we're waiting for them to clean a table and I go to the restroom. The women's restroom was deplorable!!!!  I almost left then but I proceeded to use the men's restroom which was not too good either but it was a better option in my state of urgency. Ok... back to waiting. The hostess finished assisting cleaning a table and walked away to enter the kitchen... I see her before she goes into the door and I catch a glimpse of her seemingly sheer stretch pants/ leggins. That was the final straw!  We walked out. I do not wish to dine in a place where the staff shows their butts when walking though the restaurant, downright nasty bathrooms and food the is inconsistent in taste. Sorry Kuzzos, unless I read reviews that there has been a change in management, consistent food quality  and/or better business practices, Cornbread will continue to be my go to for catfish and waffles.Please do better!!!  I'd love to support you all's business again."
8/21/2021,1 star rating,"First time here and I'm not sure what happened. First we put our names down at 1:30, she said it'll be about a 40 min wait and she'll call us. So we waited outside for about 45 min. We waited and the place cleared out some and we went in to see how much longer. We saw people who arrived after us seated. Turns out the other hostess didn't know names were written on the back of the paper...Well we got seated around 2:30 and ordered. Now we've waited about another hour, it's 3:30. I've counted 30 people across 10 tables including the outside, without food. We have two tables (one a large party) that have finished their food already. So no one is eating right now. I forgot what our waitress looked like.They may be understaffed, but at least come out and talk to us and give us an update. Refill our water. At this point I have no idea if it's better to stay and wait for the food or leave and go someplace else.Update: We left. We gave it 15 more minutes."
6/6/2020,5 star rating,"Fantastic take out experience. We ordered ahead and our tasty meal was ready when we got there. We ordered three different variations of chicken and waffles. One had a fluffy red velvet Belgian waffle with chicken tenders, my personal favorite. It also came with a side of mac n cheese. My daughter said she liked it even better than Slow's BBQ mac n cheese. The other two waffles included various chicken styles, thigh and wing with one and breast with the other. Everything was delicious. We will 100% stop back in soon!"
12/26/2020,4 star rating,"Kuzzos was sooooo delicious! I ordered a tender love carry out, and let me tell you, I loved it. The portion size was perfect. Very filling and quality food. Both the chicken and the waffle were amazing.However, I am knocking one star off because it was VERY difficult to get ahold of someone. Was calling non stop for about a half hour until my call went through. Because of this, there should be an option to order online--because I know this issue can drive impatient customers away. This was the case the second time I  tried to order. I  ended up not even ordering because I did not feel like having to repeatedly call after 10 minutes of trying.If this issue is fixed, I  will definitely consider going back. Overall-- great food worth giving a try! However, keep in mind that ordering may not be a smooth process."
12/5/2020,4 star rating,"We ordered 3 dinners the other night. One meal was chic and waffles, the second was catfish and the third was a chic dinner. Everything was flavored nicely. The sides were prepared well and seasoned properly. I personally enjoyed the rice and gravy. The greens were a little spicy for my liking but definitely tasty. We also had Mac and cheese that had a nice taste. Even though we were only able to order carry out I look forward to experiencing this again inside the restaurant. The foods pricing is competitive and worth it. Can't wait to go back and try something different."
3/6/2022,1 star rating,"I wish this review would reflect how excited I was to try the food but, unfortunately it's not. I found out about this spot on Tiktok. I am not a local and there are no places in my area that offer chicken & waffles. With the concert tonight, (3/6/22). My mom and I decided to grab a bite before the concert and go down early. Make it a nice little day trip. WRONG. We arrived to the restaurant well before the concert only to leave without any food. Disappointed is an understatement. No one gave any updates on what was taking so long, nothing. My mom had enough and wanted to leave. Instead our girls day out lunch was hitting the drive-thru slider place on our way to the arena. I would post more about our experience but, I would rather not because it singles out exact people. I hoped for a better experience. I am a huge foodie. I researched the menu the night before because I was so excited to try the food. As you can tell from the length of this review I was and still am very upset about it."
6/25/2021,3 star rating,"The food was pretty good. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and fries but they were out of fries so I got mac n cheese with yams. The chicken sandwich wasn't spicy but overall it was tasty and juicy. I would have preferred that it be fried harder and actually spicy. I  had a Long Island and the red kool-aid. The drinks were okay but the Long Island wasn't my favorite,it was too sweet. The service was TERRIBLE. We had one waitress who randomly disappeared then we ended up with another young lady. The food took forever to come even though it wasn't very busy. The waitresses seemed to have attitudes and weren't tentative. We asked for pepper and ranch. We didn't receive the pepper until we were practically done eating and they apparently ran out of ranch but the waitress forgot to relay the message until the end of our meal. It also took forever to receive refills. Our waitress refilled our glasses with water but spilled most of it on the table then didn't bother to clean it up. Gratuity was included in our checks which I disagreed with because the service and their attitudes was so poor. Lastly, I took issues with how many flies were in the area where waitresses retrieved water and ice,I'm not sure if a door was open or what but I saw at-least four flies just hanging out. A good eating experience isn't solely about the food,it's also about the level of service and cleanliness of the establishment. There's a lot of room for improvement but overall the food is good."
3/6/2022,1 star rating,I haven't gotten my food yet but I'm here as they are opening and we were the first ones to be seated but the last ones to be greater with drinks and orders. To top it all off the lady just came over and put our forks down and walked off. No welcoming attitude at all. I'm a firm believer in this type of work if you don't like your job you should just quit. I tip off service and the taste of food. I'll tip the cook in a heartbeat but if my server is rude u get nothing. U don't even have to be good just don't be rude and this lady is rude.
8/24/2021,1 star rating,It's unclaimed cous no one should own a nasty black owned business like this bro all I have to say is terrible service management is cool but hit you with no refunds when you leave look if you want good urban food drive right pass I have green eggs and ham for the first time in my life lmao omg just nasty
2/19/2022,1 star rating,Arrived at 12pm and no one waited us. Also sat multiple people before us although we were there waiting for an hour 30 minutes. No one told us about the wait or if our table will be ready soon. Lack of professionalism. Wish the manager would've came out as asked.
1/19/2021,3 star rating,"Kuzzo's - I loved the decor and the theme of the restaurant. As for the food, I found it to be mediocre at best but my friends enjoyed it."
4/14/2019,2 star rating,Really want to give Kuzzo's more stars. I just cannot at this time.  Checking in was no problem at all and was greeted kindly.  We were given our wait time of around 30-45 minutes estimated. Did not think this was horrendous for a late Saturday morning on one of the nicest days of spring after a dreary winter. We browsed the local shops while we waited. We received our text that our table was ready within the estimated time given to us. Once seated the service was not stellar. It took us a about ten minutes to order a mimosa and coffee. The drinks came in about another ten minutes and we placed our food order.  We never received coffee refill or asked if I would want another mimosa. We soon started noticing many groups and some families getting up and leaving. This was after they had discussions with staff. We witnessed more people leave without getting their food than parties who actually received their orders. Our server Jordan was engaging and nice. She did seem stressed. We inquired about or food and she explained that they have been having staffing issues in the kitchen for a while and that the servers bear the brunt of the customer's displeasure. We decided to wait and received our two orders at right about the hour and a half point since ordering.  In all we were just shy of three hours for the whole visit counting our time eating. Waffles were great. The chicken was really amazing. The chicken tenders were among the best I have ever eaten. Until the owners and management get the service and staffing figured out you may want to wait before you visit.
2/5/2022,3 star rating,"The coffee was not ready and when ready not hot. Waitress(Mercedes)was slow to bring silverware and napkins, Asked Hostess for napkins and was told only two waitresses working. All I wanted was a napkin to place coffee spoon on. Hostess did not appear to be busy as she was kicking with the bartender. The person buying the tables was more than helpful in returning cold waffles and hash browns. Overall food was excellent especially chicken and waffles."
7/4/2021,3 star rating,"The chicken was excellent, on that my wife and I agreed. The sides were mostly disappointing, not that, but we wouldn't order the smothered potatoes or rice and gravy again. The cornbread was very good and the red beans and rice were decent to me, not liked much by my wife. I'm tempted to give it two stars because of the horrendous service. Literally from the moment we sat down our server was nasty, basically throwing things down on the table and taking forever to come to the table. We especially liked her asking us if we were ready to order without ever providing a menu, then acting pissy when asked for a menu. We also loved never getting drink refills and hearing a table close to ask also ask her for menus when she asked for their orders, again without providing menus first. Everyone else was fine, not sure what M'a problem was, just a bad day, I hope, but she was rude to other tables, too. We won't hesitate to try it here again, but it will probably be takeout next time and different sides."
7/7/2021,2 star rating,"Phones doesn't seem to work as we tried calling multiple times but just kept ringing even though restaurant wasn't busy at all when we went in. Ordered chicken thigh and a drumstick, drumstick was raw and thigh was over cooked and dry. Although skin was crispy just how I like it, the batter used was very salty as was their collards. Lemonade tasted like powdered lemonade with extra extra sugar. Takeout service was good, friendly woman who took my order. I'd like to think this was just an off night for them but overall my first experience was a bad one."
7/5/2021,2 star rating,"Went yesterday for first time in few years. Got there an hour before close. Was happy that they had outdoor seating and no wait. After being seated for 15 minutes I went back inside to hostess and asked for server. The server came out and instead of greeting us, he went to collect receipts off of a table. I asked him if he was our server then he came over to take our order. When the food came out, it was only a half order of shrimp and grits when I ordered a full. They took that order back and I sat and watched my husband eat (I tasted his cheese eggs and waffle which were good).  When my food came out, the sauce was very salty and it did not taste like cheese were in the grits. The biggest issue that I had is that little gnats started swarming my dish and when I asked to move inside I was told by hostess that I couldn't because they were closing. Then the server came and asked me did I want a box while acknowledging the swarm of flying bugs around me as I was fanning with a napkin to keep them  off of my food. Ultimately, we were allowed inside because I pushed back (turns out that there were still people inside eating). With this, I won't be requesting to dine here again.***note, unlike it says on Yelp, staff were not wearing masks***"
3/15/2020,1 star rating,"Drove from downriver all the way to mid Detroit! It was not too crowded so we ordered our food...Arrived about 1245pm for a carry out that was supposed to take 10 to 15 min...it took literally over an hour to receive our food! We watched ppl that arrived after us...they came and went...No one cared at first. Manager finally noticed and took great care of us after an hour of waiting. The owner was aware and did not say one word to us or acknowledge us. I ordered $50 worth of food...this won't happen again because I will not patronize this business again. I was so disappointed. For an owner to just look over us like that, was very unprofessional and bad for business. I didn't take a pic of what I ate but I included a pic of my daughters shrimp and grits which she said was good but have had better.Thank you to the manager that helped in the matter."

6/5/2020,5 star rating,"We called to order in and had a hard time getting through, so when we did get through we were told it was walk ins only. So we drove out to the restaurant and due to Covid, they only allow 5 people inside at a time. By the time we ordered and got our food it had been about an hour. But let me tell you something-- THIS. WAS. WORTH. EVERYYYYY. SECOND. OF THE WAIT!!!!  We had Trey Deuce and a waffle with a chicken breast, cheesy grits and Mac and cheese.  Guys. I'm not kidding. Don't walk, RUN YOUR BUTT to Kuzzos. That was legitimately one of the best culinary experiences I've ever had. Even with the waiting and having to reheat it at home. It was worth every bit of the wait.  I can't wait until we can dine in!"
11/21/2021,3 star rating,"So I'm here at Kuzzos and I been here about 30 minutes was seat promptly but the table was dirty we asked the waitress could she wipe off she said sure had the bus boy wipe it down. And have yet to return to take my order, haven't been given water. And when the other young lady point out she had two tables that have place order she stated if I come to the table and they ain't ready to order then they have to wait until I make the time to go back and order."
11/28/2018,5 star rating,"Damn good food. Damn long wait on the weekend.90 minutes from door to food in front of me- glad I didn't arrive hangry, just a bit hungry.  Was it worth the wait? Yes. Yes it was.I went for all the sides and some chicken.  I should've added a waffle in there, but the sides and cornbread were so much I had lunch for the next day.  Bonus- I didn't have to wait 90min for the leftovers, and they were just as good. ;)"
11/15/2018,3 star rating,I was so excited to try this place but it was not that good. The chicken is not that crispy and was so salty. I got the red velvet waffle which tasted okay. The consistency was too soft and dough. The corn muffin was pretty good. The side of mac and cheese was so bad.. like it tasted like the kind you make from a box. It barely had any cheese or flavor. The koolaid drink looks awesome! But be warned it's super sweet. I think I had a total of two sips before I had enough. Also its huge so if you're thinking about ordering a second one I'd think again.
6/24/2021,5 star rating,"Great place with great food! I will definitely be coming back. I got the waffles, scrambled eggs, and Turkey bacon. The lemonade was super sweet and I loved the vibe."
10/4/2021,3 star rating,"On a trip to Detroit for a concert riding down ""Black Excellence Row"", I see a name that sticks out but is all too familiar in African American families. KUZZO..... Debating if I was Cuz-o or Koo-zo, I had to look at the menu. The company has done so well with explaining the meaning it made me want to try it even more. Placed a phone order, 30 minute wait....went into pay and noticed how the ambiance of the establishment felt like auntie/uncles house where all the family gatherings are held. I did notice how unpleasant or unwelcome I felt by the younger women were, from the hostess to the carry out order person.....being the first person you see in an establishment matters. After about another 20 minute wait my order arrives which was a southern platter. Get back to the car to notice that the southern platter I was given didn't have the sides requested, just the protein. Went back in and the looks given as if I made up the story was a bit comical.....got the order corrected to only notice no utensils were given and no sauce provided. Didn't bother going back in because of how I felt like asking another question would receive an eye roll. Overall food was good, macaroni could be less crunchy but everything else was to perfection. I also enjoyed the waffles as they seem to have cinnamon in the batter. On the next trip I'll be sure to eat in and hope the service will be better!"
5/14/2021,5 star rating,Excellent food and very well portioned! Waffles were delicious and kool-aid was !! I shall return
9/21/2021,1 star rating,Just asking for a friend ... but does the staff even wanna work??????????? Like you wait at the door for 15 minutes and then wait for someone to come to your table for another 15 minute then your drink takes another 15 minutes and then the food salty. Get it together ... oh and there is like 5 waitstaff here lol ........
10/3/2018,3 star rating,"The kool aid, amazing! The atmosphere, pretty dope. The food I ordered,  ehhhh. I was too excited to try this joint while visiting Detroit, but the wait for food and my chicken (Thigh, specifically) was not to my standard.  We were immediately seated,  but it seemed like forever before the food came.  When it finally did, my chicken thigh looked like a chicken nugget-- small and extra crispy. I asked for another one, and the 2 new ones our server provided were the same.  I eventually ordered a leg which came out looking a lot better,  but the taste wasn't all that.  The catfish was great and my greens were pretty good too--I'd pass on the rice and gravy though.  I'd return for kool-aid (all 3 flavors), catfish and to try a waffle.  It's worth another shot."
9/20/2020,1 star rating,"Placed a DoorDash order & the restaurant confirmed then canceled, 2-HOURS LATER. Saying they ran out of the items. It seriously took 2-hours to realize you didn't have my order?? Crazy"
11/4/2018,3 star rating,"This is my second time here and both times the food was great. The 3 stars is reflective of the wait time....over an hour to be seated and then   at least another 45 min AFTER we ordered. There were people sleeping at at least 2 tables the wait for food is so long...and one of the sleepers was an adult!Now let's talk about the food...Waffles: great! I think they use a little bit of cinnamon in the batter.Chicken: crispy on the outside, juicy in the inside. My thigh was a little on the small side, but the 3 pieces my cousin had were decent sizes.Catfish: my sister had it blackened. It looked good and the little piece I grabbed when she wasn't looking was perfectly seasoned.Grits: nice and creamy. Perfectly cooked.Biscuits: these should be illegal they're so good! Dripping with butter and honey plus they're light and fluffy. Hmmm mmm mph! That's all I can say.Coffee: good, nice flavor. But the mugs are stained...a little bar keepers friend for the next was should take care of that.Kool-aid: I didn't have any because it's really, really sweet, but they do this cool thing when they pour it and each flavor stays separate...it looks like it's striped.Bottom line...will I come back? Absolutely! Do I recommend it? Yes, indeed. Just be prepared to wait for some really good food."
10/18/2018,3 star rating,"This review is based on two separate occasions. First time I ordered delivery via GrubHub at 11:30, it said it would be a 45 min wait which is no problem, about average for delivery anyway. I didnt get my food until around 1 PM. It was not due to the driver because the food was not marked picked up until 15 mins before it was delivered. There was also no way to get in contact with them because all the phone numbers listed for them were not connecting. Not sure if that was intentional. By the time I got the order I was starving! I got the red velvet waffle with tenders and potatoes. There was no butter/cream cheese or powdered sugar on the waffle like its supposed to and I just didnt like how their homestyle potatoes were seasoned. My second try, I walked in to order takeout. Loved the interior and art on the walls. The hostess was nice holding the door open when you walk in and out. I ordered the same thing as last time but requested butter and powdered sugar to which they replied that it already comes with. Thankfully it did. This time I also got the smothered potatoes which is basically their potatoes smothered in gravy. I liked it better because the gravy masks the actual seasoning. The tenders were kind of dry and I didnt receive the ranch even though they asked what sauce I'd like for the tenders. The meal was definitely better the second time around. Even though it was a slow Thursday morning, it was a 20+ minute wait, I can't imagine what a busy weekend morning would be like."
8/15/2018,4 star rating,"This is now part of my restaurant tour. I ordered the What Up Doe and it was phenomenal.  So much foor for only $15! The waffle came with too much butter, so i rather have it on the side but it was still awesome.My girlfriend ordered the red velvet and that one was nasty, however, the chicken is delicious!!! Eggs fluffy, vibes are on point. The food takes a while to come out, but with the unique art work, and atmosphere gives you plenty to look at."
11/17/2021,3 star rating,"This would have been a 5 star rating but... THE WAIT!!!! We went on a Wednesday afternoon at 3pm.  It took an entire hour to get our order placed and to get our food and there were only 4 other couples in the entire place at that time of day. I can only imagine how long the wait must be on the weekends. I will say this... the chicken and the waffles were some of the best I have ever had. That is the only reason why this rating isn't a one star. I almost would be willing to wait an ungodly amount of time to get those chicken and waffles. They are, by far, the best in the city.   And I didn't know they had a bar but the drinks were definitely potent we're definitely potent. Someone needs to work on the organization in the kitchen so that food gets out more quickly and that you have wait staff to come to the tables quickly and often.  It was hard even flagging someone down. We didn't know who our waitress was.  Keep the great food but please pick up better customer service. You are too great great of a gem for the city of Detroit for you to lose your momentum."
2/3/2021,2 star rating,"The only reason the stars are taken away is because of the TERRIBLE customer service. The food is fire but a few of the workers have M A J O R attitudes. I called to place an order. I was told the food was going to be ready in 20-25 minutes. I got there and waited TWO AND A HALF HOURS! It wasn't until I told the worker I've been waiting that long, she JUST put in my ticket order. And still was missing items because they ""ran"" out. The food is good but do not go when you're hungry, or if you have things to do in the day OR if you don't have the energy or patience to deal with terrible customer service."
8/31/2018,4 star rating,"Came to town and was invited here and boy am I glad I came!! The chicken was outstanding! Perfectly fried and seasoned. Wish they had a spicy version, but hey. The waffle also was good, though I agree with another reviewer who said that they put too much butter and should offer on the side. My friend had the hamburger and fries, which he enjoyed. The patty was thick and juicy. The downside was the level of attentiveness by a the wait staff. Our table required a re-wipe as did the table next to us - three times no less. The women's restroom could use more attention as there were broken pieces of the tissue dispenser and garbage can tossed underneath sink. Would eat here again."
7/24/2021,1 star rating,"After waiting for 45 minutes to be seated we got a horrible server his name was Marlon. We asked for water to take meds had to approach the manager after waiting 30 minutes. Marlon took our order for drinks they never came, once we mentioned that he told us it's only two servers. After 57 minutes we left after only having koolaid. It was another server who's table continue to get service and food continued to come out we even asked if we could tip her to take over our table. I spoke to the hostess and 2 different employees MARLON NEEDS TO BE TRAINED AGAIN SINCE CUZZOS IS A VERY BUSY PLACE.... It was a F for me and this was my first time."
7/24/2018,4 star rating,"So much more than just chicken waffles!  Another new spot in the redoing of Fashion Ave.  Kuzzos is a nice trendy spot.  Walk in nice atmosphere has a bar and tables it's not a big spot but nice size.  The menu title are made either by side of town, Detroit lingo or name of cousin and family.  The food price is good.  I didn't think it would be crowded on a weekday but I was wrong.The food was good but I could of had a little,mimosa has a nice kick to it too!  I laugh because they have look aid Detroit has a lot a new up and coming spot this place right here make sure you put it on the list.One challenge will be the parking."
4/22/2019,3 star rating,Words I thought I would never hear at a brunch spot. Me: I'll have a coffee Kuzzo: We're out of coffeeI just had grits and toast. They were good. Shared some if my mom's koolaid. Taste just like when I was a kid. They have a multi colored one that is kind of kool. It's worth a visit just to see this. Service is slow. I think they're going through growing pains. My hunch is they have multiple owners that don't agree much
9/17/2021,1 star rating,"9/17/21 4:30pm. Absolutely horrible. Terrible service and terrible food. Showed up to this place after a long shift at the hospital. Upon arriving I waited 20 minutes to get seated despite the place not being busy with many tables open. Was not greeted by server, seemed like she didn't wanna be there, tall black girl with pony tail. Waited 30 minutes for food. Ordered the ""what up doe"" meal grits were watery, chicken was cold and unflavored, ""cheese eggs"" had sprinkles of cheddar cheese. How do black folk mess up grits?????Never got a napkin with my meal despite asking the server twice. Also, they never prepared my to go order I requested while I placed my dine in order. An absolutely awful experience. I will be sure to spread the word about this place. Absolutely terrible. I Do not recommend!"
3/7/2018,5 star rating,"So I'd hate to write a review without checking in... but this place came before I decided to be a yelper. Seeing it on my cousins yelp review, I had to second his review!Back when I took a trip to Michigan with some of my cousins, we went food exploring. Every single person in Detroit kept recommending Coney hot dog places, but each one was the same or not that great. I wish I didn't spend so much time eating hot dogs and found this place first...Kuzzos was my favorite! Each menu item has a creative name and most menu items come with chicken waffles and other sides. The chicken was crispy and flavorful.. filling my taste buds with excitement! Like waking up on Christmas Day. I got the ""What up doe"" which comes with three pieces of chicken, 2 huge waffles, eggs and grits!The service is a1 as well, never had to ask for a refill. I'm glad I didn't have to wait long cuz that smell of chicken waffles is really irresistible. It will make your mouth water!!Although the places around here looks a little run down, this place is definitely the light. If Michigan is ever a trip again... you can cash me insideee here"
5/11/2018,4 star rating,"It's not Roscoe's, however they do have some great offerings when it comes to the fried chicken and waffles.I went for lunch, street parked and walked in around 12pm.  I put my name down for 2 people, was told I'll be texted messaged when my table was open (i noticed when they entered my information, they put down 35 minutes for wait time).I pulled to the side and within 10 minutes (before getting text message that my table was ready), a gentleman walked up to me and seated us.  We reviewed the menu and with with the following items:- bam bam (2 drums and waffle)- dark & lovely (1 drum, 1 thighs and waffle)- Mac-n-cheese- Greens- Fried Green TomatoesFor drink, we got water.  This place is loud and it's hard to hear the waitress when they stop by to take the order.  After waiting 15+ minutes, our food started to come out.Fried Green Tomatoes - fried to perfection, however if you eat it by itself, then it's very bland.  Tasted like they did not season the tomatoes before being battered and fried.  I would highly recommend you dip it in the dipping sauce, as it'll take the flavor to the next level.  Mac-n-Cheese - skip it.  To be honest, the Mac-n-Cheese at KFC tastes better.  Not seasoned at all.Greens - get it, cooked for long time, seasoned very well!  I could eat this all day long!!Chicken - fried very well, juicy inside and delicious.  On my order, I got two small thighs, the first one was good, the 2nd one was over fried.  The drums are huge.  I also ordered the chicken gray, dipped the chicken in there, excellent!!The waffles were good, they ask you what you want in the waffles, I went with pecans.  Overall, not bad, prepare to wait.  I heard the wait time on the weekend can be an hour or longer.  The seating/waiting list needs some work.  As we were finishing, I got a text message that our table was ready.  Don't get me wrong, I was happy that we got seated within 10 minutes from putting our name down."
5/6/2020,1 star rating,"Ordered our food over the phone, they said it would be ready in 20 min. It took 11/2 hours before I got my food. Kept going in to check on status of food, employees swearing at each other. Very unorganized, I asked fo my money back and was told to be patient!! Seriously!!The food was not good!! Waffles were soggy, chicken wasn't great, I threw most of my meal away! What a waist of money!I Will never go back!! 0 stars is what I wish I could give this place.The employees are very rude!!!"
9/30/2021,1 star rating,"They food was just the worst thing I've ever tasted in the city of Detroit. The waffles tasted sour for some reason, and the lady failed to give me hot sauce. Who in their right mind eats chicken without hot sauce? I love black owned establishments but we gotta do better. All I can say is the lady was nice to me. So the customer service got them a 2 star instead of 1."
5/8/2021,2 star rating,"Waited far too long over an hour for the food and my server who's name was Mercedes was very rude but in the end she apologized and tried to clean up her attitude. The food was subpar, the catfish was okay while the waffle was dense and soggy, the shrimp and grits were horrible and the greens were just okay. All in all I was sadly disappointed at the service and the food. To go further the grits were tasteless; I could not taste any cheese. Highly overrated and over priced! The only highlight was the drink I had! Came all the way from Texas to be disappointed! Wasted over 2 hours of my time!"
9/16/2020,3 star rating,"Cute place to grab a bite. I would ask for a little more organization from the wait staff, however it is covid and we are still adjusting. Drinks and food were good."
12/5/2017,5 star rating,"I loved my first visit and plan to come again. The service was great, friendly and fast. the food was delicious. comfort food like this is such a pleasure on a chilly detroit afternoon. I had the first lady with a chicken breast and a waffle. well I had to fancy it up cuz you knooooo MIchelle would have her waffle with Pecans and some Candy Yams on the side of that platter.Ooooooo honey chile. I think they brought back memories of my momma's fried chicken. so tender, juicy and delicious I savored each morsel. the waffle was filled with pecans and topped off with whipped honey butter. the sweet maple syrup made me lick my fork. this was the meal any southern girl would love on a chilly tuesday afternoon; after appointments on the avenue of fashions.the sweet tea was delicious not syrupy. served in a mason jar you have the perfect size to put a bit into a take away cup they will bring with your check. such a fine gesture usually only found at southern establishments.I plan to come back one evening for a cocktail and wings at the bar, because the crowd certainly seems friendly. Yes this is the type of place us oldies but goodies gladly share with the young folks and chilluns. this place will be here for a good long time as long as they stick to this formula.Thanks Kuzzos for the great food and friendly service"
9/6/2021,2 star rating,"Went for a carry out, 2 wings and a waffle. The wait time is ridiculous. I waited almost an hour and a half. It took so long, I asked the young lady about my order. She went to the back and came out, went back again and came out with my order in 5 minutes. The food did not taste as good as it used to taste. I wont be going back there soon."
3/7/2021,1 star rating,I've tried to give this place several opportunities to redeem them selves and I get let down every time. Awful customer service and the food is mediocre. Plus they do not answer the phone to place an order over the phone. Which makes you have to go order in person and wait a half hour for your food to drive all the way home to find out your order was made wrong. Then you can't even call to tell them your order was messed up bc they don't answer the phone. Not going here ever again.
8/31/2021,1 star rating,"One star because the food is decent. Everything else truly is horrible. From the staff to the customer service to the ambiance, zero stars. Wait times are absolutely ridiculous. The floor was wet. I almost fell a couple times. We asked for the floor to be dried. No one ever did it. Food was left under our table from previous guests. No one cleaned it. Condensation was dripping onto the table next to us from the ventilation pipes in the ceiling. Took over 20 minutes for first round of 4 cocktails. Next round, 2 cocktails took 20 minutes. 1 showed up after we asked for the check. Not really sure about the 4th. The food took forever and then we were told they were out of one of the sides. Gratuity is included. Don't mind. But they include gratuity because their service sucks and they wouldn't make any money otherwise. My friends went to get takeout the following day. I refused. They waited over an hour and received the wrong order. They were denied a refund but offered a gift card lol. We were traveling from elsewhere. Even if we did live in Detroit, we would never return to Kuzzos. They need some serious help. None of the staff seemed happy to be there. It's a complete sh*t show. I don't blame them. Food is decent though."
8/23/2021,1 star rating,"This Saturday was my breaking point with them and their services. I've gone multiple times like maybe 4 years ago not at all recently and I was like ""yea I think I want Kuzzos today"" so I order via Doordash. I knew they were going to be busy so I took my time assuming the chefs know how to prioritize the orders coming in. I get there maybe 45 mins after my order I go up to the carry out area and ask if my order was ready yet because sometimes the restaurant doesn't tell the app that they completed the order yet. The girl checks in the back and tells me it'll be another 25 mins. I say cool and I go sit in my car for another 30 because I thought that extra 5 mins would be a little cushion to walk back to the restaurant. I go inside and it's 2 people ahead of me waiting to be addressed by the girl working the carryout station. She finally addresses us and moves us all by the bathroom. It's now 6 of us waiting on our carryout orders and everyone is from doordash. It's now 1hour and 45 mins after my order time and then the app tells me the order is complete. I'm confused because I haven't been handed anything and the girl hasn't returned over to our area. I ask another waitress and she goes to check and says we have another order but the last name is an ""R"". I even ask ""what's that order"" because maybe they read the last name wrong. They never told me. Then the original girl comes and says that somebody else picked up my order, which means SHE HANDED MY ORDER TO SOMEONE ELSE. She didn't seem to care that I've been telling her my name and my order for an 1+ standing inside of the restaurant. They didn't try to fix the situation they didn't say ""hey let me tell the chef to make this quickly"" or ""let's give you something"" or even apologize for the 2 HOUR INCONVENIENCE!!!! Nothing at all. So all of this to say that the customer service I experienced Saturday was absolutely terrible and I won't be returning, which probably means nothing to the restaurant but I know I can't go through that again. I've never been moved this much to write a review on a restaurant but I had to share."
8/17/2021,1 star rating,Was very much excited to try them but sadly was unable so due to the long wait for food after willingly sitting outside to enjoy the experience and the forgetful server who was very much nonchalant after appearing to take on multiple orders from other tables. Decided to leave and still had a run around with checkout due to the poor communication and staff pretending to play stupid.
7/30/2017,5 star rating,"Before going to Detroit, I looked into the ""top"" places to eat and Kuzzos consistently came up. When we met up with a cousin in the city, Kuzzos was the first place she mentioned to try and the rest was history. The hype was real! We expected a long wait for a Sunday morning at about 11 AM but lucky for us, a table was leaving just as we walked in! The menu is really simple and straight forward. But I already knew what I was going to order. FRIED CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! They have different and entertaining names for different combinations between how many pieces of chicken, waffles, and sides. I ordered the ""What Up Doe"" and it was the best meal I had during my entire trip in Detroit. Just look at the picture! Big pieces of chicken perfectly fried and seasoned on the outside and very tender juicy meat inside. The waffles were soft but buttery and huge. Just a very great and delicious meal. The prices are more than reasonable and they allow you to switch items around like the sides and pieces of chicken (dark, white, legs, wings, breasts). Definitely recommend and would love to come back!"
12/30/2018,1 star rating,Came here for brunch but ended up eating chicken and waffles as an early dinner..... Waited for an hour and half to be seated (we were quoted 45 minutes). Sat at a table for 15 minutes before a server came to greet us. Waited 15 minutes for a Bloody Mary. Fourth five minutes for food. Yikes..... Would avoid this place on the weekend. Food might be good but this restaurant isn't run correctly.
5/24/2018,3 star rating,"I have dined at this restaurant twice.  Both times, the wait was over an hour, but I was ok with that, seeming I feel like this is a very popular restaurant in the city.  The first time, everything was absolutely delicious in my opinion.  I ordered the Big Red (3 wings; Red Velvet Waffle).  I loved it.  And I ordered Kool-Aid.  So I was very pleased with that visit.  My last visit however, was very disappointing.  Service was bad, the waitress seemed rude.  I tried something different, and ordered the Aunt Mary's (Salmon croquettes - served w/cheese eggs, grits & toast).  The salmon croquettes were not good in my opinion, not at all.  The food was cold, and it took 25-30 minutes for everyone at my table to received their food.  I would however try Kuzzo's again, but maybe throughout the week, and not during a weekend where it is super crowded."
5/24/2019,2 star rating,"This is a Detroit staple that I've taken every friend and family member from out of town. For me, it represents the revitalization of the neighborhood.Our wait on a late Sunday was 5 minutes. However, if you come straight after church or during that time you will probably wait 1-2 hours. When you walk in, you're immediately greeted. They have done a better job at staffing. Everyone is polite and friendly. The atmosphere is typically nice and jazzy. Old school and R&B vibe.The food so the waffles are straight up amazing. The chicken is seasoned to perfection. The scrambled eggs are a hit or miss. Sometimes it's too runny. The grits are basic. However, the shrimp and grits looks really good but that is a meal by itself. The bacon is good.The lemonade is very sweet. The koolaid is really good. Any alcoholic drink I've had here was not worth the money. It's a decent size venue. I love the Motown flavor. I can't give it 5 stars because you can not order in for take out. You have to come in. There's been multiple times my coworkers and I wanted waffles and chicken and we couldn't get them from this lovely establishment. Update: they took my order online after I asked if I can now place an order. Waited for 20 minutes and get there to be told they forgot they couldn't take orders. No apologies no customer service. Complete waste of time and I spoke with the manager and she said she will accommodate me. I'll update if that actually happens"

Had coffee that was never refilled.  Literally haven't seen the waitress in more than a half hour.  Staff apparently have a total inability to read the room because no one has food. This was once a decent place to eat but the quality of the food has gone down and unfortunately so has the attentiveness of the wait staff.  Sadly, it seems that diners are more interested in eating here than the wait staff is in serving them."
7/29/2021,3 star rating,"All I wanted to do was have breakfast with my friends for my birthday, but my waitress was having none of that. This place has some of the absolute best food, the music is great and the atmosphere is absolutely everything, HOWEVER the stank attitude at 10am was sooo unwarranted! I understand that some customers are horrible but pls don't greet customers with nastiness!! The only reason I didn't ask for a manager or even address her nasty was bc it was my bday and I will not allow idioticy to drain my positive energy. I do have to note that other waitresses were friendly and handled their customers appropriately. Guess my terrible service was a luck of the draw."
11/23/2018,1 star rating,"I'm really confused about why people like this place and wait hours to get in. First time eating here today...takeout...Completely disappointing. Asked for my eggs to be scrambled lightly. They were so over cooked they were brown. What kind of cook/chef let's browned scrambled eggs leave the kitchen?Asked for butter for the grits. No butter included at all. Not even for the waffles. Chicken wings were barely warm and not at all crispy. I'm pretty sure they were cooked hours before I ordered them. Hardly seasoned. Waffles. Just gross. Like two wet sponges. I managed two bites. Ick.  Way to much cinnamon. Tasted like those eggo cinnamon toast waffle things (except those aren't soggy). I wasn't satisfied with any part of my order. Based on other reviews is seems this place is inconsistent, unprofessional, and has terrible customer service.Again, not sure why people wait in line to eat here."

11/29/2016,3 star rating,"I met Big Red, she looked scrumptious, smelled like honey and sweet cream, and left me satisfied. Her friends...meh they weren't as desirable.  Made a trip here based on a few recommendations and the Yelp reviews of course. My hotel was 32 minutes away. My Uber driver got lost picking me up AND dropping off, so an hour later I arrived mad and so hungry I could have passed out at any moment. The outside and inside is quite trendy and inviting. It was a weeknight at 8pm, so diners were scarce. Fine by me, faster service.I ordered immediately since I had an hour to kill beforehand. Big Red, so a red velvet waffle with this cream cheese topping stuff, three wings, collard greens, and grits. I killed the waffle, smeared the cream everywhere, and drizzled it with the maple bourbon. 30 seconds in and I started tearing that thing up with my hands and dipping it into the syrup. Fried chicken hmm...it was okay. Nice crunchy skin, cooked perfectly but seriously lacked flavor. It was quite bland and didn't standout. The collard greens I found a bit too salty, the grits on the other hand lacked salt. My server was great, food came quickly, and the restaurant had a fun vibe. I enjoyed my waffle, but one trip is good enough for me."
10/28/2017,5 star rating,"I've been waiting to try Kuzzos for a very long and finally got the chance to this morning and I am very glad that I did. My fiance and I loved our meals. We expected a line when we got there and there was. We waited 35 minutes to get seated. They send you a text message when your seat is available so we went to a local coffee shop while we waited. I ordered the what up doe which was 3 pieces of chicken, 2 waffles, grits and an order of eggs. My god was this meal good. The chicken was seasoned perfectly. The waffles were bursting with flavor of cinnamon and brown sugar. You will definitely leave satisfied and full. Don't forget to order a big glass of Kool-Aid. Took me back to my childhood. Give Kuzzos a shot and you won't be disappointed."
9/13/2020,1 star rating,"A friend and I opted to come to Kuzzo's last week Sunday around 10am, because (as far as we knew) they had outside seating, and we wanted to get there early enough to take advantage of it before it got crowded.  Much to our surprise, we were told that outside dining was closed and that we'd have to eat inside...something we weren't terribly comfortable with initially, but the host insisted that we would be socially distanced and that indoor dining was at 50% normal capacity.  I don't know who makes these types of decisions, in the midst of COVID, but if you are going to do so, make sure you execute this with fidelity and using common sense.We take our seat at a table by the window which was more than 6 feet from another table in the bar area.  The bar was completely empty when we sat down.The waitress comes to take our order-- only to have to modify our order because they are either out of items or don't sell them (e.g. ""we don't have coffee on Sundays).  We gave our order around 10 after 10am.As we wait, and wait, and wait for our food, we begin to notice that the bar area is starting to fill...with no social distancing measures being taken either by the establishment or the patrons.We wait for almost an hour for our meal.  This is problematic for a number of reasons: 1) it shouldn't have taken that long for our meal, especially when you are not at capacity.  2) it became increasingly clear that they prioritized carry-out orders, instead of dine-ins, and 3) if you are going to force patrons to dine-in, then you ought to minimize their potential exposure by a) maintaining ALL social distancing measures and b) making sure you minimize their wait time for food.The food itself was terrible.  The waffle (which I had to substitute b/c they didn't have any biscuits) was flat.  My eggs were cold and hardly had any cheese I asked to be added.  The grits that were supposed to come with butter were more like butter that came with a pinch of grits.Overall, a waste of time and money and too risky to patronize."
10/4/2017,3 star rating,"Kuzzo's is yet another stop in our fried chicken odyssey. The light drizzle did not stop the line from spilling out the door from this large space, a good sign. Since we went at the height of brunch, the wait was predictably long. I should have taken a moment to call ahead as others had done or made reservations on Open Table. I liked that the restaurant implemented a text-based notification system to alert diners when their table is ready - I so wish more restaurants had that foresight.As we waited, we caught up on each other's busy lives, trying very hard to ignore the large plates filled with waffles, chicken and other tempting breakfast items making their way to others. I knew exactly what I wanted, which wasn't part of any of the combinations featured on the menu. No matter, the sides menu was large enough that I was able to create my exact meal for a combo-ish price. The fried chicken was exactly as I expected based on previous reviews: well-seasoned chicken with a crunchy coating. The waffle was large and thin with a nice scoop of room temperature butter and a small container of sweet maple syrup. I liked the fluffy biscuits that glistened with butter and honey and the mason jar of Kool-Aid. It was like a rainbow in a jar. Talk about a sugar rush.There was apparently a challenge in the kitchen which slowed everyone down considerably. The server apologized several times throughout the meal for the slow service and the longer-than-necessary wait for the chicken. Unfortunately, we were not served food at the same time so the food that was served first got colder during the wait."
10/17/2016,4 star rating,"If you haven't been to Kuzzos...then you must visit! First, the neighborhood that Kuzzos resides in will provide visitors who have not visited Detroit since the early 2000's a new insight of who Detroit is now. The economic devastation of the recession has not been wiped clean, but like a overgrown garden, this street provides an insight to the regrowth of the beauty of what is Black Detroit. Kuzzos is surrounded by beautiful art gallery's, boutiques and other businesses worth checking out. Now onto the restaurant. This place is always full for a reason. The food is awesome!! When you walk in you are greeted with two parts of a restaurant. The first side is long bar and some seating area. One of its walls has an incredible painting of the late Tupac Shakur. The main dining area also has beautiful paintings adorning the walls. I did not get to sit and eat, however those waiters and waitresses that I did come across were all very nice and helpful. In the back where it says restroom is the take out order area. There you can order your food to go and after a quick 15-20 minute wait your food is bagged and ready. I ordered the sautéed Shrimp and Cheesy grits with bacon. It was very tasty. I would've asked for more butter in my grits, but that's a personal desire. The shrimp and grits is definitely worth trying. In addition I picked up the kids version of the chicken and waffles. That order came with a drumstick and a large cinnamon waffle. The waffle was SOO Good. Because it was to-go it didn't have the crispiness of a waffle, (steam) yet it didn't take too much away from how good the waffle was. The chicken was just ordinary fried chicken...nothing too different from the norm. Overall I was very satisfied with the taste and speediness (of the carry-out) of Kuzzos and will be back to the restaurant when I visit Detroit again!"

10/2/2018,3 star rating,"Just..... okI got to experience kuzzos via uber eats. So my review is of food only not the service or drinks.I ordered a Trey Deuce, which is Three pieces of chicken and two waffles with a side of whip cream and strawberries.The strawberry cup was tiny for the extra charge associated with it (small let down) The flavor of the waffle was just ok. Original house of pancakes, roscoes in Cali even ihop have a better taste. The chicken was again.. ok. Cooked through, nice crunch just not much flavor. Nothing to write home about.Maybe sitting in the restaurant what yield better results. As it stand this was not the most horrible thing I've eaten but not anywhere near the best...Just OK, I don't really need a second visit and probably would recommend it as a ""must try"" spot..."
6/14/2020,4 star rating,"Went here after the BLM cruise down Woodward to support black business in the historic commercial district Avenue of Fashion. Picked it almost entirely because it was close by and black-owned. We were so pleasantly surprised. The best fried chicken and waffles I've had in the state! The chicken is crispy and flavorful.  Not too greasy. Meaty. Generous portions. And there's a hint of spice to their batter. Excellent. And their waffles are just as good. Smaller and on the thin side, which was kind of a relief, because who can really eat an entire Belgium waffle plus chicken and sides in on sitting? They are thin and maybe 12"" across. And target tase like delicious French toast ... absolutely some cinnamon or other like spices hi lighting the sweet waffle batter. Our daughter loved the grilled cheese and crinkle cut fries. And we saved the best for last ... shrimp and grits and Mac n cheese. I mean, there was just too much flavor in all of this. It was amazing. The shrimp and grits was bursting with seasoning, especially the bacon. Salty and robust ... I can't put my finger on what it was ... but it is GOOD. The grits are a smooth, creamy and slightly sweet background to the loud favors of the marinated shrimp, peppers and bacon atop. All of the food is seasoned properly (and not just with salt and pepper) for max flavor. We did get some eggs and some home fries as well. They were fresh and tasty - but nothing uncommon. We ordered around 2:40pm and our order was ready as promised at 3:10pm. We were required to wear aMask to come inside, which made us feel better about getting take out from this place. They are taking precautions seriously. 2 entrees and 2 sides plus a small side of scrambled eggs and home fries came to $40 and change. We will be back again. The area is charming with a lot of new businesses around. Good parking and accessibility. And wide sidewalks for outdoor dining. It makes getting in and out, parking and walking much easier! Loved the food. Loved the renovations to the restaurant. Loved the result of all the new road and sidewalk construction.  Love supporting a black owned local business. We will be back."
7/20/2020,1 star rating,"People praise the food here. Apparently they haven't had good cooking. The food is horrible. I've never had a steak that had no flavor, no grill taste, just a bland steak. My waffle was so flat I was looking for it. The only thing worth stopping in here  is the Koolaid. I do NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone. Sorry not sorry!"
4/14/2021,2 star rating,"I support all black-owned businesses especially in Detroit. While house shopping around in University district I decided to stroll over to the Avenue of Fashion. Once there, i seen Kuzzo's and decided to give them a try again to see if the quality got better since they reopened. I ordered a ""Tender Love"" meal (3 chicken tenders & a waffle) + a cup of blue kool-aid. The waffle was soft and soggy, the chicken tenders were hard and stiff, and the blue kool aid tasted like blue Hawaiian punch. Also, the gentleman at the register was acting like he was confused when i came to pick up my order and provided poor customer service. I pray they get it together but I definitely won't come back. I can make better food than what they are serving. I wish them the best regardless."

A friend was in town from DC and I thought I'd give the restaurant a third try.  In a dining room that was two-thirds full, we waited 25 minutes for waffles, eggs, and grits.  Ditto on the paper cups for coffee dining in.  My DC friend was not happy with me for bringing her to such a subpar restaurant.  She said, ""If you knew the service was bad, why did you bring me here?""  I'll know better in the future."
6/14/2016,5 star rating,"I recently read an article about former Detroit Lion player, Ron Bartell, opening a restaurant in his old neighborhood to give back to the up and coming historic Detroit Ave of Fashion area located on Livernois and 7 Mile Rds. I added it to my list of places to try for brunch. One Sunday morning shortly after, it was my turn to pick places and I picked Kuzzo's, who's moniker is a familiar cultural term of endearment that describes a family like relationship. Upon entering you can't help noticing the beautiful decor that includes a large bar like seating area with a solid brick wall hosting a large sign defining the Kuzzo meaning. The other walls were brightly painted and covered serves as a gallery displaying hand painted art complete with a larger than life portrait of the late, great Tupac Shakur. We were told there would be a 15 minutes wait but were seated in 5 minutes. Service was great, food came out fast and was fresh and hot. Hubby opted for the ""Belle Isle Basket"" filled with southern fried catfish and heaping with fries. I opted for the ""What Up Doe"" combo complete with fried chicken, waffles, grits and cheese eggs. The food was exceptional and the waffles were hands down the best I've ever had. This place is a must try for any Detroit area brunchers out there."

6/9/2019,1 star rating,"I can imagine they won't be around too much longer. I've been to Kuzzos on 3 separate occasions. So my review is complete and overall they are a disappointment.There is ALWAYS a wait to be seated even if there are many open tables in the restaurant.Once you are finally seated then it will take 20 mins for a server to even come up to the table so you need to be ready to order EVERYTHING right when they come because your food will take an hour no matter what you order.Now... last time I went they were out of coffee, Mac and cheese, and collard greens. I should have left but I already committed almost an hour at that point. The food is pretty good but not worth the wait and unprofessionalism along the way. I can get soul food and waffles from anywhere."

The atmosphere is very nice but on the exterior not much has changed except a few new wall art pieces. The food is really good at a decent price but the customer service and wait times are atrocious! I asked to speak with a manager and he never came to my table. If you do come here, just get it to go and save yourself the headache."
3/25/2018,5 star rating,"Can't say enough good things about Kuzzo's. They have the best fried chicken and waffles in the area! Seriously, nothing compares. Came on a Saturday morning and they were pretty busy. We had a group of five and there was a bit of a wait but really not too long. The decor is pretty cool. Modern Warhol-esque street art depicting Abe Lincoln wearing a Burger King crown, Marilyn Monroe and Run D.M.C. hanging on their warm red brick walls. Their food is pretty phenomenal. The fried chicken has a crispy flavorful exterior and tender juicy meat. They have lots of breast, wing, tender, waffle, and egg combinations on their menu ranging from $6 to $16. I ordered the Big Red, ($14) three wings or tenders, one side, red velvet waffle and bourbon maple syrup. It was so delicious! I chose tenders. The red velvet waffle was dusted with powdered sugar and a heap of sweet delicious cream cheese frosting. Sides include traditional delicious home cooking including baked beans, collard greens, yams, cornbread, homestyle potatoes, toast, biscuit and gravy, fried green tomatoes, eggs, mac and cheese, and bacon and other breakfast meats. You can choose to add additional sides for $2-$4. I chose mac and cheese as my side and it was really good. They also have salads, sandwiches and omelettes. If you come to Kuzzo's, you have to get the mixed Kool-Aid, which is layered red, purple, and blue Kool-Aid served in a large mason jar. They serve alcoholic drinks too including Kuzzo's spin on a Tom Collins with Faygo and Kool-Aid, mimosas, bloody mary's, and a Faygo Kool-Aid Long Island. The service was awesome. Our server was very warm and friendly and checked on us several times. We brought our possum stuffed animal puppet (don't ask, lol), our group mascot, and our server asked if he could bring ""Jerry"" some water too. Kuzzo's has super delicious food, fun decor and atmosphere, and warm friendly service. I'm still craving and dreaming about their chicken and waffles and can't wait to come back soon."

Thank goodness there's not a place close by I know about that serves this delectable treat! .I stopped by Kuzzo's while visiting Detroit recently. It was a great choice for my first taste of this combination. Everyone here was so friendly and helpful, mind you they chuckled a bit when they found out it was going to be a first for me. The waffles were out of this world! The chicken was super crispy on the outside & oh so tender & juicy on the inside! Covered in syrup, it was incredible! Oh, and did I mention the sweet tea & lemonade? I've been missing out, seriously! Anyway, the food was delicious, I can't wait to come back, .Thanks Kuzzo's!"
3/25/2021,2 star rating,Really disappointed hasn't had it in a while so ordered shrimp and grits. It's was pretty bad. Grits weren't cooked all the way through and very bland. The peppers were really soggy. It was just all around not good. I actually just threw it away because it was horrible. Not sure what happened. Had positive experiences in the past. It also took over an hour to receive the order.
4/29/2020,1 star rating,Can you give negative stars!?!?? Why can't local small restaurants on Livernois Ave get it together? Why was I able to place an order online if you are not open???? Why do you have hours posted that you do not intend to keep??? This is my third time trying this restaurant and I can say EVERY time there is a MAJOR issue...buyer beware.
7/16/2016,5 star rating,"Wow wow wow.  My sister-in-law recommended this place, along with a few others in Detroit, and this was amazing.  She said to go early, which is usually hard for me but I made it.  9am on a Friday it was moderately busy but not packed.  Service was superb start to finish.  There are a ton of things on the menu that I wanted; it all sounded good.  And it's not like I was starving- I had a little breakfast at the hotel- it is just really good stuff.I went with the Uncle Junior combo, which is two pieces of chicken plus grits.  Real grits, cheesy if you want them, with butter and sugar if you want.  Creamy, smooth, hearty.  Good stuff.  The chicken was perfectly fried, flavorful through and through, and made me want more.  I had the daily special fried corn as my side.  Not really fried, of course, maybe sauteed, but fresh corn with seasoning to round out my meal a bit.It's in a rundown area, but it's welcoming inside.  Prices are great.  Parking is easy.  Decor is nice, atmosphere is friendly, and I will go back the first chance I get."

3/14/2019,1 star rating,"We wanted chicken and waffles for lunch so I called ahead to find out they don't do call ahead carry out. The woman on the phone said they were not packed so the order wouldn't take too long. When I arrived, I was told to go to the bar to order. I sat at the bar unserviced for about ten minutes, after finally flagging the woman manning the bar, she told me I could only order at the end of the bar. Placed my order at 11:25 and it was not ready until 12:12p. The food is good but not enough to deal with the hassle of poor business management. It's 2019 and there's no reason you can't call and order ahead or have food ready within a reasonable time frame. 50 minutes to simply wait for carry out is excessive and speaks to poor management. It's a shame because the place is extremely cute and could be an amazing day party brunch spot but I will never return."

I got the First Lady which was a waffle with a chicken breast. The perfect amount of sweet and savory. However, we did wait a good 40 minutes for our food and it even took a long time to get/pay for our check. The waitress was around very minimal and not very friendly which took away from the experience some.Overall, excellent food but could work on the service some."

Food well prepared but my egg was stone cold, waffle barely warm and grits piping hot. Entire staff moves in slow motion. No sense of urgency . Other guests seated around us seemed agitated and confused by such poor service . Clearly a place that needs new management and staff training. But, it's always been this bad. I won't ever go back."

The wait time was about 3 hours and staff including management didn't seem consistent with communication to customers. Attitude, rudeness, and sly comments ran rapid amongst the staff. Unfortunately for me although the food turned out to be good the lack of professionalism and people skills stood out more than the food.Also there was shadiness with one of the bills at our table and the gratuity Charge."

It took forever for my friends to receive their drinks from the bar, it took about 20 minutes. I had the chicken and waffles with a side of scrambled eggs, and the food was not worth the wait. I had pecans added to my waffle and the flavor of the pecans wasn't good. I have had better waffles from waffle house. It took forever to get a refill on water. The waitress disappeared for long periods of time. Greeting someone goes a long way. Needless to say I don't recommend this place and won't be back."
5/25/2019,2 star rating,Took 45 min just to get drinks....and I had a water. After waiting a hour for food they brought my meal out without sides and said it be a few more minutes. Ended up finishing meal and still no sides. Waitress didn't seem to care. We ended up just leaving. The food isn't worth the poor experience
5/24/2019,2 star rating,"This is a Detroit staple that I've taken every friend and family member from out of town. For me, it represents the revitalization of the neighborhood.Our wait on a late Sunday was 5 minutes. However, if you come straight after church or during that time you will probably wait 1-2 hours. When you walk in, you're immediately greeted. They have done a better job at staffing. Everyone is polite and friendly. The atmosphere is typically nice and jazzy. Old school and R&B vibe.The food so the waffles are straight up amazing. The chicken is seasoned to perfection. The scrambled eggs are a hit or miss. Sometimes it's too runny. The grits are basic. However, the shrimp and grits looks really good but that is a meal by itself. The bacon is good.The lemonade is very sweet. The koolaid is really good. Any alcoholic drink I've had here was not worth the money. It's a decent size venue. I love the Motown flavor. I can't give it 5 stars because you can not order in for take out. You have to come in. There's been multiple times my coworkers and I wanted waffles and chicken and we couldn't get them from this lovely establishment. Update: they took my order online after I asked if I can now place an order. Waited for 20 minutes and get there to be told they forgot they couldn't take orders. No apologies no customer service. Complete waste of time and I spoke with the manager and she said she will accommodate me. I'll update if that actually happens"

5/19/2019,3 star rating,"I went to Kuzzos for brunch today for the first time. It's a popular restaurant so there were a lot of people when I arrived. There was about a 20 minute wait for the table. Once seated the waitress seemed nice. I ordered a mimosa and waited. A couple sits across from me 15-20 minutes after I am seated and they get their mimosa before me. My waitress was no where to be found. I went to the host to report what I observed. Her response is ""I'm not a waitress but I can find your waitress."" I clearly knew that she wasn't a waitress. All she had to do was apologize for the delay and say she would find my waitress. AFTER AN HOUR, I finally get my food. (The waitress did warn us that it would be a wait.) The skin of my chicken was seasoned to perfection. The meat of the chicken was tough. The yams, mac and cheese, and greens were pretty good and my mimosa was decent too. I don't see myself running back to Kuzzos but I may go if invited by a friend."
5/17/2019,3 star rating,Let's begin with the fact they confuse chicken nuggets for chicken tenders. My chicken tenders were so small they must've been chick tenders. The waffles were pretty good. For two waffles I got one of those little plastic cups of syrup. They decided I just needed to sample it and the butter I guess. ‍ Dont expect to be able to call your order in cause it's not allowed! I was in a rush and had to order in restaurant which was a 15 minute wait. The bartender was tending and doing pick up orders. Then it took my food a little over 25 minutes to be prepared. So the food experience wasn't worth the wait. If you have nothing to do and just craving waffles I'd say go for it... and I mean NOTHING!
7/11/2019,5 star rating,The music playing was to my liking hearing the 90-00's music playlist was icing on the cake. Very affordable nothing priced outrageous maybe the most expensive thing on the menu was like $15 I wanna say. Small in size so may have to wait but went during the week was seated quickly but it did fill up. If you visit Detroit this is a must visit place
9/13/2015,4 star rating,"This place has been on my list to try for some time as well.  My friend lives close to Kuzzo's so she frequents it often.  She always raves abou the food saying it was her new favorite restaurant.  So on a Saturday afternoon, I decided it was time that I finally give it a try.  Parking is not the most convenient.  They have metered street parking directly in front of the establishment.  The restuarant itself is not very large.  They have tables and booths on both sides.  For my very first time, I knew I had to get chicken and waffles since that is what they're known for.  I got the waffle and the fried breast.  It was delicious!  The waffle was larger than what I expected.  It was perfectly golden brown and not too sweet with hints of vanilla and cinnamon peeking through.  It came with a large dollup of butter on top.  The fried chicken breast was moist, tender, and well-seasoned.  My friend opted for the red velvet waffle with fried chicken wings and collard greens.  The red velvet waffle was good but I preferred the original waffle.  The collard greens were also good, not the best I've ever had, but good, nonetheless.    My other eating companion had the omelette with ham, tomatoes, and mushrooms, a side of potatoes and wheat toast.  She said it was delicious as well.  The service was a little slow and maybe that's because we went on a Saturday evening.  The food was worth the wait.  There was only a one-stall bathroom so you had to wait your turn to use the restroom.  It would be nice it they had more restrooms available but that's a small thing.  I also hear the kool-aide is delcious!  There are so many things on the menu that I want to try.  I definitely plan on returnig to make my way through the menu."
5/4/2018,5 star rating,"A generous portion of Chicken and Waffles that tasted so damn good. The waffles were top notch and their chicken was crispy and delicious. The marriage of sweet and salty dances across your taste buds. We arrived around 9:30AM and were able to get a seat right away. The service was pretty good, maybe a little on the slower side, but the food made up for it in spades. I would highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back."
3/22/2019,1 star rating,DON'T arrive 30mins. Before close you won't get seated. Despite the reviews I figured well its a 50/50 chance of good service. Arrived at 8:30 un-used chairs were already stacked like they were ready to go... we were greeted and told CARRY-OUT ONLY!!! If your open until 9pm I should have still been seated & served... might try again.... might not...
7/4/2020,3 star rating,This business has three phone numbers and they don't answer any of them. Ever.Food is good but phones are never answered.
7/23/2017,3 star rating,"THE FOOD AND SERVER SAVED THIS REVIEW FROM BEING LESS THAN A 3. Let me start by saying that this was my first time here and first impressions are EVERYTHING. The server was very kind and attended to us whenever we needed. We got our drinks on time and the Koolaid (Red, Purple, Blue) was AMAAZING. It took me back to my childhood. However, at one point, my girls and I were thinking ""Wow, it's kind of taking a while for our food to come out"". We had been there for an hour and a half at this point and the other customers that came in next to us were getting very impatient which they had the right because they had been there longer than us. Our server then communicated to us that there was an altercation in the kitchen with the cooks and that only management was there to fill in. The only thing that the other tables and mine were confused about was why we're other tables (that just sat down) getting their food. A server explained to us that they have to go by ""orders put in"" but that wouldn't make sense because they got there after us and I watched them sit down 20/30 minutes after us. A woman and her crew decided to leave and explained to us that she had been waiting since 2:45pm and it was about 4:40 (Yikes).  We decided to stay because we don't live in the city anymore and we kind of came a long way. We were hungry and I heard great things so I was trying to give it a chance. Needless to say, it took almost 2 in a half to 3 hours to get our food. We also felt rushed because it was almost time for them to close by the time we got our food. We also had to ask for some form of compensation for something but management should've already provided that to those who've been waiting an extended amount of time for their food. I felt bad for the servers because they had to put up with all the backlash from angry customers/those that have been waiting. It wasn't their fault there was an altercation and that the food was coming out slower than usual. Our server was very kind and very thorough in communication to us which I appreciated.However, the food was absolutely delicious. We did have a few issues because some of our sides (Mac and cheese and etc.) were missing and my friend was stating the cheese grits had no cheese whatsoever in them even though they convinced us there was. I had the special of a blueberry waffle with tenders and a side of macaroni. So SO GOOD! We couldn't even go to our dessert spot afterwards we were so full! Tasted like a great home cooked meal.I may not be coming back any time soon because of this first time experience. But I will be willing to give it another try just as long as there isn't so long of a wait time."
6/22/2017,4 star rating,"the chicken and waffles were amazing, best i ever had. I got the dark and lovely and my sister got the tender lovin. We thought the drumstick was the best, then the tenders, and then the thighs. The chicken and waffles were prepared so well that the thinness of the waffle really worked well with the moist, crispness of the chicken. We also got the cheesy grits as a side and did not enjoy that. It basically tasted like butter. It seems like everyone is a fan of the Big Red (the red velvet waffle) so would definitely get that next time. For not being that busy it took awhile for our food to come out, other than service was good. Parking was honestly not that bad, just make sure to pay at the designated kiosk. (follow me @cookinwhanz for more food pics!)"
10/11/2017,3 star rating,"My second time here and the same issues with service persisted. We were told we could be seated pretty quickly (there were probably three couples ahead of us), and instead it took a full 45 minutes, including after 3-5 parties were seated ahead of us who came later. I'm always patient when people make minor screwups, but the staff were pretty disinterested. The service for the food itself was pretty fast-- we got a regular order of shrimp and grits and a ""mini"" one, which was annoyingly most of the price of the full order but about a third the size. The shrimp and grits were pretty awesome, though.Would definitely go back for the chicken, waffles, and sides, but I am really a bit skeptical of the service model at this spot-- they just don't seem to have it together."
8/30/2016,3 star rating,"Collard greens and mac and cheese were awesome-- two quintessential sides that, much like pizza, are hard to screw up but hard to get awesome. The chicken wasn't game-changing, but it was solid. I did not deduct any love for the frustrating use of the term ""maple syrup"" to describe high fructose corn syrup, but I also didn't use any of it because the red velvet waffle was sort of like a magical, textured donut with cream cheese icing.There is a bar, which serves principally alcoholic and not alcoholic iced drinks of varying hues of pleasing, lurid colors and tastes. I am not picky about what I drink when I eat chicken, but we enjoyed our drinks.My major complaint is that the service is always extremely slow. I'm usually not in a rush to get food, but this is the place you go and wait 40 minutes to be seated and then wait over an hour for your food. I have actually only been here once, but I've tried to come a few times and have heard stories about people taking three hours to get in and out.In conclusion, it's a great spot, but the popularity of it suggests that they probably need to open up a second location and probably also hire some additional staff to manage the kitchen."
12/28/2018,1 star rating,"I'm writing this review while I've been waiting an hour to be seated. Only to have someone tell me they've been waiting for food since 4pm and it's going on 7pm. This is beyond ridiculous. This place needs a revamp in service and speed. While the ambiance is nice, it lacks in service. I'm repeatedly walked past when trying to get helped or get questions answered. When I finally do flag someone down, they say ""okay lemme check"" and you don't hear from them for another 20 minutes. Step it up. I'm about to walk out. Wanna support my own but I don't wanna settle for less. Might be my last time coming."
10/6/2018,4 star rating,"The food here is great. Service has stepped up a little bit since I was last here, but there is still room for improvement. They have a disclaimer on the menu that says if you want hot fresh chicken allow 15-20 minutes for your food to come out. Similar disclaimer for the red velvet waffle. So you will wait a little while for your food. This place could benefit from a larger location as well. But overall, good food, good koolaid. Don't come if you're in a hurry though."
1/2/2019,3 star rating,"I've visited this restaurant many times. The food is great. I have frequently got the tender love with chicken tenders and a waffle. The waffles are quite thin but taste good. The additions to the waffles aren't quite worth it for me (pecans, strawberries.) it such a small amount that it doesn't make a true difference. The batter used on the chicken is delicious and the warm syrup makes it even better. I've gone during off peak times and received the best service. A few times I've gone in and been told there was an hour wait and I didn't stay. There is not a lot of space to wait inside and during colder months, waiting outside isn't an option for me. It is not the best for waffles, but it's a neighborhood restaurant with good chicken.The service is subpar unfortunately. Not very pleasant servers, pretty much doing the bare minimum. I visited on 1/3 and it took me getting the attention of another server to request my server come over. It was about 12 minutes before we were even addressed and then she still wasn't pleasant to interact with. ""What would you like to order"" and ""can i take this plate away for you"" was probably the only thing I heard her say. She didn't check once on how the food was, and when we requested water refills, she took her time. We saw her on FaceTime standing at another table before she returned.  Continued patronizing is questionable... their servers need training for sure."
4/21/2018,4 star rating,"Back again...this time even better AND they have butter.  Made me happy. I'll be back. Previously....We tried the chicken and waffles. The prices are fair. The food good and served hot. Our service was good as well. My only problem is I was told they don't serve butter, and only have margarine. That was a big disappointment for me because I wanted grits, but didn't get any since I don't like margarine. Other than that, we enjoyed ourselves. We are going to go again and try something else on the menu. Maybe I'll take my own butter so I can try the grits next time."

6/5/2017,4 star rating,"I had been wanting to try Kuzzos for a long time and finally had the opportunity to this past weekend. I had a great experience for the most part and will be back again!We had a rocky start trying to find parking as there is only street parking and that had already been taken up by other customers. We had to park the next block down in front of a grocery store. Once arriving, we were sat almost immediately, and then had to wait about 10 minutes for a server to greet us. After that, however, it was all amazing.We both ordered Tender Love with a side. I got the biscuits and gravy. The gravy tasted almost like alfredo, but it was good nonetheless with their fresh biscuits. The chicken and waffles...of course, were amazing. I made the regrettable decision of eating each bite with a piece of waffle and a piece of chicken until the very end...I tried the waffle by itself...love the flavor! Next time...eating them separately!Kool-Aid seemed a bit steep at $3.50 until I saw the size of the glass that it came in. It took two of us to drink it all. Very good! We'll be back to either get more chicken and waffles, or to try their lunch menu as I saw that they had a turkey burger with turkey bacon on the menu - a rarity! The manager checked in on us twice throughout our meal to make sure we were okay and were enjoying our meal...which was a great touch. Great staff all around."
1/4/2018,5 star rating,"I love this place!!! best chicken and waffles ever!!They also very good cheesy grits and regular grits, collards and sweet potatoes!  The only thing I did not prefer on the menu was the fried green tomatoes.  I'm used to the heirloom green tomatoes that come out of my garden, but I love that they have that option on the menu!"
3/20/2019,3 star rating,"Food was good but not worth the wait. Waited 1hour & 30 mins for a table Sunday March 17 on St Patricks Day about 2:30pm. We had a party of 6ppl. Or you can say 5 and a baby b'cuz my niece was in a highchair. Ask we waited i lost my appetite then sat at the bar. The bartender was over talkative, she basically ignored me when I asked for a moscow mule. My uncle had to stop her again to ask for my drink. When we were sat i food took about another hour to arrive. We ate a few fast bites and our server was amazing. Very attentive; She had braids, sorry I cannot recall her name. We boxed up most our food cuz we barely were hungry after waiting so long."
1/14/2020,5 star rating,"The service is meh. A lot of the menu items are just okay. But hey, for the area this is the best you're going to get and the chicken and waffles are fantastic. If you're not just going for some fantastic chicken and waffles, then what were you thinking you'd get?"
1/2/2020,2 star rating,"My experience at Kuzzos was not great. I was super excited to finally try this place. I was coming to meet a friend, I got there 5 minutes before her--but you know how some of our restaurants are, even when it's lots of tables your whole party must be there... even when it's 2 of you. Moving on, the waffle was great but the chicken was dry. The drinks seem way overpriced, and all our sides were greasy or salty. Maybe it was a bad day? But it was bad enough that I probably won't be back. Our server also disappeared for a while. I've also tried to order carry out a few times and can't get through on the phone. I hope this place continues to do well--and that my experience was an anomaly."
3/30/2018,3 star rating,"Visiting from ATL and this place was highly recommended after posting about Black Owned Businesses in Detroit. When I walked in I spoke to the Hostess she looked and stared without responding. We also parked outside and since it was raining we sent someone from our party in to let the Hostess know we had a 5 top. The Hostess said she had to see all members of the party before seating. As a former server, I know that this isn't an unusual thing, however, when we walked in, it was NOT packed or busy at all. Kinda wack. The playlist they had going was great! Kind of made up for the awkward energy. Our server made up for the hostesses lack of friendliness, but she instantly asked if we were ready to order and didn't ask if there were any first timers or give us the history of the restaurant, popular menu items, or anything. My sister has something in her drink, and then a blue string in her collard greens in which the manager didn't even come out immediately to address the issue. We still were patient and didn't overreact because things happen, but again, lack of customer service was a theme here. He did end up knocking off $8, so there was an effort there. The names of the Menu Items are super dope! I ordered the Big Red which was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection so that is something that I will say was great about my experience at Kuzzos. The Mac and Cheese is not a suggested side, but the yams and the grits were pretty good. I would say the greens but after the extra ingredient, we were a bit apprehensive about eating the rest. Overall, I would say definitely give Kuzzo's a try. It's worth going and seeing for yourself and one day of lackluster  service doesn't speak for the other servers or hosts that are a part of the restaurant. And definitely give that Big Red a try!"
11/9/2017,5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I checked out Kuzzos on our way out of town after a concert. Thankfully it wasn't too busy around 10:30 on a weekday morning so we found some street parking on Cambridge and were seated right away. Our server was super friendly and fun and checked on us throughout the meal. I ordered the Tender Love (3 tenders with 1 waffle) with a side of cheese grits, and my boyfriend got the Dark & Lovely (1 thigh, 1 drumstick and 1 waffle) and a side of biscuits. The food came out pretty quickly and everything was awesome! I'm not really a waffle person, but these waffles were a little thin and slightly crisp and the flavor was really good! I ordered mine with strawberries and whipped cream, they also have a ton of butter on them. The tenders were juicy and a large portion. They were slightly under seasoned but still really good! The cheese grits were amazing! Full of great cheese flavor and swimming in a small pool of butter... so good. My boyfriend's chicken had super crispy skin and was perfectly juicy as well. I can imagine this place gets packed on weekends, so if you can manage getting there for brunch during the week I would highly recommend it!"
8/27/2017,5 star rating,"I got the chicken and waffles (of course). The waffle was delicious and freshly made. They have a unique batter that was to die for.The chicken was large, tender, and juicy. They definitely give you enough food. I ordered the Kool-aide mixed, it was really pretty and really good.  However it was very sweet so take that into account when orderingThe atmosphere was nice they put a lot of thought into it. It makes you feel at home. The service was also great.It was nice to see the owner there it shows he cares about how his business is doing and if absolutely shows.They need to make a way to reserve ahead of time. You will have to wait a while to get in. it's extremely  inconvenient. Parking is also nonexistent so take that into account as well.Overall, I like this place a lot because of the wait I won't be going often but I will definitely be back."
6/18/2019,4 star rating,This was maybe my 4th time here and I can say I'll gladly come back because Alexis was GREAT! She greeted me at the door upon my arrival within moments and asked how many were in my party. There were three of us but they wouldn't seat me because everyone wasn't there (hence only 4 stars). But once seated it was a pleasant surprise that Alexis was our server. She was polite and prompt. She stayed on top of things through it our entire visit. Good came out hot and correct. No complaints here!
1/3/2018,5 star rating,"This was an amazing experience from start to finish. The ambiance and the music are great. The namesake of this place, the chicken and waffles, are spectacular. I also had some of their cornbread and my girlfriend some of their candied sweet potatoes. All of our food came quickly and it was hot and amazing. I want to come back and try their expansive breakfast menu and some of their alcoholic drinks. Service was great and prices were reasonable."
12/3/2017,4 star rating,"I'm giving 5 stars because this place was pretty asweet and one of the best restaurants we visited on our trip to Detroit. That said, we do have recommendations. First: The food was lukewarm by the time we got it about a half hour after we got there and about an hour after we waited in line. Generally this kind of service hiccup can be solved by either making food to order so that it is hot and that justifies the long wait time or you can increase kitchen staff to handle the volume. You're brunch was great but your restaurant seemed unprepared. Second: You're hostess was great but it's important for the hostess to have a good handle on what's going on. We specifically didn't like how she seemed to be somewhere else mentally while seating people. It's really nice when the hostess is attentive, has a great memory and is engaged with their job (at least while they are doing it). Third: We tried to order a fruit cup and were met with confusion. I helped our server understand what I meant and then she in turn brought me a side of strawberries. It would be nice if there were lighter options for brunch. Fourth: Your Bloody Mary's are bad. No two ways about it. I think it was the overwhelming amount of pickle juice and lack of cayenne. Basically I got a glass of pickle juice with vodka in it. That's gross. Fifth: you should serve coffee to people that are waiting. It would encourage people to actually wait around and you could make a few bucks. Everybody wins. Sixth: you should have chicken strips. Straight up. No excuse for that. Thanks for reading and we hope we have a better experience next time we come to Kuzzo's:)"
10/17/2016,4 star rating,"I'm glad the line at Kuzzos didn't intimidate me because we surprisingly didn't experience a long wait (~15 min) on a Saturday morning. Thanks to pictures on Yelp, I just had to try that layered kool-aid. The kool-aid was tasty, but it was a lot for just me. I suggest sharing one since you still have to make room for the food.Speaking of food, I keep forgetting that Detroit food portions are completely different than Seattle. So I just had to go with the Big Red: Red Velvet waffle with 3 chicken wings and a choice of side. I couldn't make up my mind between collard greens or mac n cheese so I had to get both. When the food came out, I was surprised at how big the portions are. Don't get me wrong, the food is amazing. I have to say Kuzzos makes the best red velvet waffle I have tasted, since you can make out the cocoa flavor. The cream cheese frosting on top is all you need to sweeten the waffle too. The chicken wings have a nice crisp and were juicy, while my sides were delicious. As I have mentioned earlier, I forgot about who big Detroit food portions are and I only polished off 2/3 of my food. If I could have done this differently, I would have skipped on the mac n cheese. Don't get me wrong, it was good but the collard greens were even better. I like that the greens are not overcooked and had a generous amount of pork in them.I do have to warn you, the bathroom line does get long and there's only a single stall restroom in the place. Its surprising that for a place that big that they only have one bathroom."
9/9/2020,1 star rating,I try to support black owned businesses but every time get disappointed with their service. I waited 40 minutes for them to tell me they don't have what I ordered then suggest something else for them to come back a extra 15 minutes to say they that have that. Chicken over cooked. Overall experience was terrible. Wouldn't suggest eating here at all!!!!
3/31/2017,4 star rating,"Got the chicken and waffles and for the price it was pretty good. Unfortunately the chicken and waffles here didn't compare at all to some of the other places I've been to. The waffles were too soft and felt more like pancakes. The chicken was very crispy however they lacked flavor on their own. Overall it was just ""ok"" and I probably would not come here again. With that being said, if you are craving chicken and waffles and youre in the area I recommend coming here. 4 stars because it's decent. Definitely not five stars :("

If I could change my rating to one star I would they deserve nothing more.This place is managed poorly and this is totally clear in their execution from front of the house to the back.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY"

8/3/2016,3 star rating,"First you should now, there is No FREE PARKING.  I almost got a tix because I parked on the street and there is no signage that you need to go a kiosk (which you cannot see from the front of the place) and enter in your License plate # and pay with a credit card or coins, no bills.  Apparently there is an app you can download too, but I haven't gotten that far yet.  So the Meter Maid was walking up the street giving everyone $45 parking tix.  I ran out there and explained that I had no clue, and she said if I could make it to kiosk before she got to my car, there would be no tix.  I made it!The place if vibrantly decorated with local artists.  My fav is of Ab Lincoln in a Burger King crown.  We started off sharing fried green tomatoes which were good with the very spicy mayo.  Both my guest and myself had the Kobb Salads, which hit the spot.  The only negative I could say is that it was evident that the chicken was prepared beforehand and refrigerated.  It was a bit cold, dry & chewy.  Other than that I think I may be frequenting this place more often since it is close to my work.  A nice change from the Ferndale fare.Update:Went for lunch there again and got the Salmon brunch plate. It was canned Salmon patties that totally tasted like tuna, with cheesy grits that were not cheesy what so ever.  The biscuits rocked though."
7/3/2019,1 star rating,"To start this review I had to give at least one star when I really wanted to give it NO STARS! We tried going there on Tuesday and it was an absolute FAIL. As much time as we spent there, we could have probably been to another place 3x's. We literally waited from 1:25-1:58 for a table of 4. We probably would have waited longer if I didn't question the wait seeing that 2 other parties were seated ahead of us even though they came in after us. But yeah, we still waited. We placed our drink order in at 2. Followed up with our appetizer and meal order at 2:15. Our waitress did come back and say they didn't have certain foods and that there was a back up, but we were patient. Honestly, we were so busy talking enjoying our company it wasn't until 4:00 that I realized that we didn't get any food yet and people who arrived with us ate and left and people who arrived after us even had their food. At 4:20, I was floored and furious. I got another waitress' attention but honestly it was already too late. We just said forget it and left. Never again will we be back. WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!"

9/13/2018,3 star rating,I LOVE chicken and waffles and frequented this spot a lot when it first opened. The food is great. The service not so much. The last three times I've gone is was consistently bad. The food continues to be the draw for me to return.

9/4/2020,1 star rating,"We had the worst experience today with the kitchen manager at Kuzzo's Chicken & Waffles. First, we ordered at 10 am through DoorDash. They estimated our delivery time for after 11:30 am. We waited and waited. We learned via a doordash chat that the food would be here by 11:55 am. It was not. When it finally arrived after 12 noon the waffles were soggy, the eggs were cold, and there was an order completely missing. We paid $64 and waited for 2 hours. We then went to the restaurant and told them what happened. First thing out of their mouths ""that's on doordash, not us. Take it up with them."" We asked to speak to a manager. The kitchen manager Allen was there, the general manager was not. The bartender contacted the general manager who stated that she was gone to the store and wouldn't be back for 40 mins. While I contacted doordash, Allen comes out and gives my friend the absolute worst attitude. He actually told her that it was not his problem and that he would not remake our food. I asked to speak to him. One of the waitstaff went to get him. He didn't move. When the door opened again I said ""hey"" and he looked up. I had to go open the door to the kitchen to get him to even acknowledge me. When he came to the door, he said ""what's the problem?"" I said ""are you remaking our food?"" He turned around and walked away like I hadn't said a word.  Luckily, one of the waitresses was kind and sympathetic. The bartender, who I assume was the head bartender, did remake our eggs and waffles herself. By the time we got back to work, it was after 1 pm. We ordered at 10 am. I cannot understand how business owners want our support but don't want to provide the appropriate service. As a business, if you choose to utilize doordash, grubhub, etc. then you also need to take responsibility for their service. Doordash didn't forget to pack the missing order. Kuzzo's did. You cannot blame everything on someone else. I'm not writing the review on doordash or vowing not to utilize doordash in the future. My review is based on the experience I had with Kuzzo's. And it was my first time there. I will not return. Black owned or otherwise, I don't spend my money where it is not appreciated or respected."
7/6/2017,5 star rating,"First time at Kuzzo's and the food was Ah-mazing!! I had the Big Red- red velvet Belgian waffle, 3 fried chicken strips and side of smothered potatoes. I couldn't finish it all but wanted to!Red velvet waffle was soft and delicious, the chicken was fresh and seasoned well!! The smothered potatoes were ok, I wasn't a huge fan of the gravy but I'd get the potatoes again just not smothered. Our waitress was on her last day of training and she did a great job! Everything was great!"
11/11/2018,3 star rating,"For waiting 45 minutes to sit, then an extra 40 minutes to get my food, this wasn't worth it. The Big Red was good but the waffle was a little too thick.  The waitress said there's only 6 people in the kitchen but they clearly needed more. Also, I constantly had to ask for water and/or coffee and didn't get my refills. The service unfortunately ruined the overall experience"
5/29/2018,5 star rating,"This is a fantastic soul food place! Easily one of the best I've been too since coming north from Atlanta. The place definitely strikes me as a brunch place but it's really got a nice airy interior.I believe I got a spicy bloody Mary to drink which was good especially the bacon they added in. The wait time can be kindve long so you'll need what you can get to hold you over. The food  was fantastic. I got the three piece fried chicken and the sausage gravy, mac and cheese, and rice/gravy. The fried chicken was so crunchy, not to greasy, and absolutely delicious. The sides were all fantastic especially when mixed with the gravy. The cornbread was good but I wouldnt say it was great a little bit too dry in my opinion.Dont come here for healthy food. Do come here for delicious food."
6/15/2019,1 star rating,"EATERS BEWARE! If I could give this place -10 stars, that would be sufficient. I went there yesterday evening with family from out of town. I was excited to take them to a popular Black owned establishment. I had been there a few times before with subpar customer service, but last night solidified my decision...I AM NEVER SPENDING ANOTHER DIME IN THAT ESTABLISHMENT!From the start, my family informed me there was poop on the bathroom floor...I looked...indeed there was. YUCK!Secondly, there was only ONE waitress there, servicing all of the patrons! Everyone else called off...I later realized why. While Valentina (waitress) may have been all alone, she was phenomenal! The wait was long and not everyone received what they ordered. When the food came out myself and another family member did not get what we ordered and were told that they were all out of drumsticks. Others had cold and over cooked food.I politely asked to speak to the manager. Upon my wait, I was informed that the manager was swamped but would take 15% off my bill. Umm...no, we are paying customers and would appreciate if the manager would speak with me. Finally manager Kay Kay walked out, with an unpleasant disposition. I spoke with her privately, not making a scene or fuss, but genuinely expressing my frustrations with the food (or lack there of) and wait time. Kay Kay then had the audacity to part her lips and BLAME my group for coming in at the last hour to order food. Please rewind the video footage. My party arrive around 8:15p. Your establishment closed at 10p. She furthered her conversation by saying, there were other people ahead of my party as well as carry out orders and she had to be fair. Then she gave a stale ""I'm sorry for your inconvenience."" While I understand things happen, it would have been nice to know BEFORE receiving my order. I explained that to her and was yet again greeted by another lack luster apology. As she walked away at the end of our conversation, she rolled her eyes. This was also observed by my guests. Needless to say disgusted can't even capture my true emotions. This place has the potential to be so much more than what it is. However, with management like that, I SEE why just about everyone called off."

6/24/2018,4 star rating,"First visit in a while.  Thankfully, this visit fell on a slower day during the week, which really allowed time for TGR and I to enjoy the view. The food was excellent as usual.  I had the combination dinner with fried chicken and catfish, accompanied by collard greens and macaroni and cheese.  Everything was delish, except for the mac and cheese.  It definitely looked the part, but something was off with the flavor this time.  Even still, 4 stars remain.The drinks were tasty and delightfully strong.  I had the Collins, which is sugared up by some of Kuzzos famous Kool-Aid.Hop over to Livernois and give them a try if you haven't already."
9/9/2016,5 star rating,"Absolutely incredible, this place is probably the best, most unique resturant I have been to all year. The theme is chicken and waffels with a soul food flair but defiently urban cosmopolitan. Let me start at the bar the Kuzzo's Long Island, it's strong but you don't really notice. It has frozen Kool aid Ice cubes!!! thank goodness for a long Island without sour mix. The Kool-aid they have is very sweet so I spilt one. but definetly like that you can get a layered Kool-aid. Now to the food, it's comfort food and you can really tell they take pride in the way they cook it. The waffles have just the right amount of sweet, not as sweet. The chicken is excellent. The grits are pretty good too. The also have general soul food items like collards, candied yams. I will of course be back."
3/20/2016,3 star rating,"The lemonade/kool-aid was the best part of my meal. I was really hoping for a well-seasoned, tasty brunch but everything was bland :( Our service, contrary to come some of the other reviews, was excellent. Maybe we came here on an off day but soft, lifeless waffles, tasteless chicken and bland grits and shrimp won't bring me back."
9/2/2018,1 star rating,I'm sitting here for 1hour and 28mins and haven't received my food as yet. If your hungry after church or hungry in general on a Sunday don't waist your gas and starvation and come here save your belly and go somewhere else's.
6/9/2019,1 star rating,"The service is horrid. No one cares about anything at this place. It used to be nice when it first opened, but it is TRASH NOW. We had to literally beg for someone to take our order. The management team is a disaster...One of them personally told me that her servers DO NOT CARE. We waited an hour for our food to come. I wanted so badly to get up and walk out...there will be NO NEXT TIME. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME COMING TO THIS PLACE."
7/28/2016,5 star rating,"WOW! Amazing! The ""Tender Love"" combo was amazing- 3 tenders and a waffle. The tenders were quite possibly the best I've ever had. They were a perfect amount of breading, chicken, and crispiness. Waffle was great, especially with butter and syrup. My group also started with biscuits and cornbread as appetizers. Biscuits were the bomb (for you southerners, it tastes like a honey butter biscuit from Whataburger). Cornbread was good but a bit flaky; biscuits were definitely better. My brother ordered the ""Tres Duece"" plate and truly enjoyed it as well.There was a bit of a wait around 11:30am on a Thursday, but we were seated with 10 minutes. We felt a bit out of place since the clientele is mainly local Detroiters (we drove from 30 minutes away), but the staff treated us with respect and we felt very safe and comfortable (parking is secure too). The best part? At the end of our meal we were told an anonymous table had picked up our bill!! SO awesome, kind, and a representation of southern hospitality. Thank you kind strangers!You MUST try this place out! Thank you Kuzzo's for a great time- we'll be back for sure!"
11/6/2016,5 star rating,"Kuzzo's is a Detroit must visit!!!  Its in an eclectic neighborhood and is always busy.  We ordered food to go it took about 10-15 minutes.  The food lived up to its reputation.  I had salmon patties, fried potatoes and cheese grits...I had to eat it in two parts...very filling.  Next visit I will surely try the shrimp and grits or chicken and waffles, so many tasty choices."

Service and the whole vibe of the place was great.I got the ""What up doe"" which had a chicken breast, wing, and thigh, two waffles, grits and eggs. All of it was excellent. I also tried there koolaid which was good of course and cool looking. Will be back!"
3/5/2016,3 star rating,"In town this wknd from Tampa for a DSO event w my lady. Decided to try this place based on what she'd heard from others locally. We arrived about 640p and were seated pretty fast for a Fri night. But after we were seated, and ordered almost immediately, it took 45 minutes to get our food. FORTY FIVE MINUTES...to get 2 fried chicken dinners! And by the time our waitress told us our chicken was ready, they had run out of the side of yams that I ordered. In those 45 minutes while we waited, we watched 2 other tables get seated, order, FINISH eating and pay their checks.Asked to speak to a manager a few times before one actually showed up. He was the day manager...he was slightly apologetic in my opinion and offered us half off on our meal (which REALLY should have been free at that point) and made sure to mention *at least 3 times in 2 minutes* that Hillary Clinton and her entourage had lunch there earlier in the day and things were chaotic and so they were running out of things-not his fault, but definitely not our problem either. What does Hillary's day visit have to do with my fried chicken at 8pm? I suppose the name dropping would have been alright if I were impressed with Hillary eating there...but I'm not, so it came across as repeated excuses. Would have loved to have spoken to the night manager, but he was too busy in the kitchen to come speak to us. He wasn't, however, too busy to come out of the kitchen to take cell phone video of a customers marriage proposal that happened as we were leaving (side-eye) along with the entire staff who stopped working. So much for customer service, I guess.Cornbread muffin and mac & cheese was good but greens were not seasoned & wasn't cooked with any meat (hmmm) and if all of that wasn't enough, my chicken was burnt....really, who burns chicken thighs!"
7/2/2019,2 star rating,"The food was pretty good, but our waitress (named Dallas) was horrible. She took our drink and food orders, and didn't come back for 40 minutes. Then she asked us for our drink orders again, but didn't come back with our drinks for another 15 minutes. We asked for syrup and she never brought it. I had to ask the bartender for syrup."
10/14/2018,1 star rating,Never again will I give these people money. Too many other black businesses to support. 1. The service is TERRIBLE 2. Carry out orders take forever3. The food went from consistently good to mehToday I ordered my food via Postmates. The delivery person waited an hour and 15 minuets after arriving for the food to be ready. And then EVERY SINGLE PART of my order was wrong and my waffle showed up tasting like styrofoam and the chicken was soggy.
8/19/2018,2 star rating,"I like the vibe, but the food is just ok. Fried green (not even a whole but 3 slices) tomato for $8 was not well seasoned at all. Had to drown it in sauce and hot sauce. Fried chicken was ok. Waffle was lukewarm and a little soggy before syrup. Also, they need to pay more attention to maintaining the restroom. The women's room was filthy."
5/21/2016,4 star rating,"The ambiance in Kuzzo's matches the meaning behind the name and the restaurant's location. With the feeling of being in your Kuzzo's basement or backyard, they're serving up Chicken & Waffles and your favorite soul food sides.My food was slappin! I ordered Big Mama's entree. 2 pc chicken, 3 sides, muffin and I got their signature Kool-Aid, which was amazing! Macaroni and Cheese was a 5 out of 5 stars, greens and rice & gravy as well. The service was decent. The hostess was a little out of sorts as she'd forgotten we were waiting for a booth and initially gave our booth away to other guests. She corrected the matter, though and we were seated. The chairs in the dining room are extremely uncomfortable--especially if you were blessed with a little more to love on your backside."
8/22/2020,5 star rating,"This was our second time at Kuzzo's. We were going to try a new place done the street but the 2 hour wait steered us away.  They were not busy when we walked in and the servers were super nice.  I mean all the ladies working the night of 8/23 we super nice.  I don't remember our servers name but I loved her personality.  Our food came quick and the ""Red Wings,  catfish, Mac and cheese, yam, and chicken we really good.  The spike Koolaid is was a little weak but good. I forgot to take pictures but it was really good and seasoned well. Thank you for making our date night enjoyable."
3/3/2016,4 star rating,"Guys. This place is great! It's a smaller little place and the food speaks for itself. Chicken is DELICIOUS and juicy! The waffles weren't the best in my opinion, as they were a little thin and not that crisp. But very flavorful. My husband said the biscuits & gravy were the best he's ever had and we had a great time. The music is on point and the service was prompt and friendly."
10/6/2018,3 star rating,"Food was good but I haven't decided if it was worth the wait. We were there on a Friday for lunch. The wait to be seated was only 15 minutes but it was an hour to get our food. The staff was nice enough and there were plenty of them running around, but it was difficult to even get a refill on our coffee or water. There are plenty places out there that serve good chicken, so it was hard to be impressed."
3/31/2019,1 star rating,"Wait staff was extremely inferior and it took 45 mins to bring me a hot coffee. From the time I sat to the time I got my food was exactly 95mins. After speaking with the manager it was confirmed there was nothing he could do to ensure my food would be remade and warm upon arrival to my table.Extremely unprofessional, unskilled, and inadequate staff from the management to the waitstaff and table bussers!"
1/5/2018,3 star rating,"To repeat all of the other reviewers, the wait is atrocious. Honestly, it is amazing that Kuzzo's hasn't adopted a different system such as call ahead seating or something. The inside of the restaurant is fairly small, and there are very few tables that accommodate parties of 4 or more, so, if you have a large party, be prepared for an extended wait. The food, with the exception of the waffles, is delicious. The chicken is well seasoned and cooked appropriately and the sides are cooked well and are decent portion sizes. The cornbread is honestly the best thing on the menu and should be served along with some type of whipped cream or sweet milk for a dessert. Now, as for the waffles...I honestly cannot understand how a place that is named ""Kuzzo's Chicken and Waffles"" can have bad waffles. The waffles are soggy, floppy, and thin. They are far too doughy and taste like a soggy piece of bread. The syrup is also cheap and watery. The service has been fair each time I have visited, and I have no complaints in that department. In all, I have been to Kuzzo's at least three times, so the wait is not enough to detract me from going, but I dread my visit here each time I relent to going here for brunch. If you're looking forward to chicken AND WAFFLES, then go elsewhere. If you want chicken and some soul for sides then come here and enjoy the food."
4/6/2019,1 star rating,"Place fucking sucks yo. So long of a wait for your order. It's crazy. Restaurant can't even hold that many guests for the wait to be as long as it is. I'm still here waiting now and I placed my order a week ago. Train the kitchen, train the wait staff, Hell train the owner! Don't go. Careless how good the chicken is. You got to put this restaurant in your planner and schedule time for this place, because you will be here indefinitely."

3/4/2018,1 star rating,"I had a $52.83 order purchased via Door Dash yesterday, my husband and I placed our order promptly at 5:22pm, we received a text saying the order was placed and it was go ETA 6:38 pm.      Okay, so now it's 6:20, we receive a text message from the driver saying that the restaurant is packed and that the order isn't yet complete, but that he will be along shortly order in hand! We let him know not to worry there is MORE than enough time with our ETA being 18 minutes away and our property that we are currently staying at is only 5 minutes away (on Outer Drive), "" no worries"" we say.      Uhmmmm, now it's 6:32 pm Door Dash driver text, yeah so they said it'll be ANOTHER 30 minutes?!! I'm like ""Oh o....wait, what? Why?!"" We are literally heading to our Toronto property at 9:30pm I thought we would be eating, then packing the car and heading out. Not leaving at 10 or 11 to drive 4 hrs on a full tummy and sleepy eye....      So I ask if he will still be paid, (since he's waited so long,) if we can cancel the order, he says ""no"", so I call the restaurant and immediately ask to speak to a manager.     Walter, the manager on staff gets on the phone I explain to him the situation, and before I can even finish saying Door Da, he starts LITERALLY SCREAMING INTO THE PHONE, ""We don't got no way to do 'own'-line orders ma'am, we don't got no way to do 'own'-line orders ma'am"", he continues to annoyingly repeat this, with his total mush mouth and lack of annunciation, no phone etiquette, elevating his tone and volume by the second.            Finally, I get frustrated enough with the him and the annoyance of his voice and speech impediment, to say ""You know what, it wasn't AN ONLINE ORDER, but that's fine I will be alerting Door Dash, and letting them know your claim of non-affiliation, and my Door Dash driver is there just tell him he can leave now!"" He replies ""We don't even do f!@$ing 'own'-line orders"". So I hang up in his face, WE NEVER RECEIVED OUR FOOD AND HONESTLY  DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING ESPECIALLY FROM THERE AT THIS, EVEN THOUGH OUR TUMMIES ARE TOUCHING OUR BACKS AND THE FOOD LOOKED GREAT.           I text the driver and just apologize for his wait and no pay, and my cancellation,( I feel absolutely terrible for him and try to offer him a tip if wants to pick it up, but he's not allowed). Door Dash update below.     So, I call back up there and speak to lady whom I ask when will the owner and/or GM be available because the whole experience was preposterous in my opinion. She was very sweet, gave me all of the information I needed, I will be calling back there today, to speak with the owner, I will update later.      UPDATE Part 1: Door Dash fully refunded me, and also gave me a credit since we'd never used them before and usually use GrubHub, they wanted to keep our business so they redeemed themselves with a credit toward a future purchase order."
12/7/2015,5 star rating,"The customer service wow'd me just on it's own!A friend and I came here on a Sunday late morning. As soon as we walked through the door a host asked if we had been helped and guided us to the host stand to put our name on the list.  The wait was only about 25 minutes, if that.  While waiting we grabbed a drink at the bar. We noticed many people were ordering the flavored kool-aid drinks (non-alcoholic) but we opted for an adult beverage. I have the Kuzzo Collins which was so refreshing. It was sweet, but not stomach ache sweet. Something I could see myself drinking on a hot summer day.When we were seated we were greeted right away even though it was packed. Our server was attentive and personable.  My friend and I both ordered the red velvet waffles with chicken tenders and a side. The side I chose was mac and cheese. Our server told us that was the most popular dish on the menu. For $12 I had a massive plate of filling food. The waffle was excellent served with a butter cream frosting like butter. No syrup even needed. Three chicken tenders were served with the waffle and the mac and cheese was cheesy deliciousness! I could have ordered an entree of just the macaroni and cheese :) I had enough food to take left overs. After we had paid we even had a staff member come by to make sure we didn't need bags for our take-outs.  It seemed like everyone worked as a team here.Positive vibe, attentive staff, delicious food and great decor. 5 stars all around!"
2/21/2016,4 star rating,"Like this place. Happy they opened in this neighborhood. Feel completely safe and welcomed. Great chicken tenders and red velvet waffles - a must try. They have full bar, but everything is either SUPER sweet cocktails, or really low-end undrinkable wine.  Wish bar menu was upgraded. Service: they try.  Some of the waitstaff really try. May not necessarily accomplish, but the intent is there. A bit of training, and they could become great servers. Others are useless. Typically don't see the useless ones again there when I go back. High turnover must be tough. Kitchen: Slow, but food really good. Tough to overlook when you see kitchen staff screwing around instead of cooking. But they try. 4 stars because of the spirit of entrepreneurship to open a nice new place in this neighborhood."
12/17/2018,5 star rating,"Okay , I hate waiting to eat , and always leave if the wait is more then 20 minutes and the wait here at Kuzzos is well worth it. Sunday at 1pm we waited 45 minutes for a table and almost 1 1/2For are food , but it was Worth the wait. There was 5 of us, we came from over an Hr away north of Detroit and I would recommend Kuzzos to everyone who loves fried chicken and waffles. There flavor is unique and food is delicious. The staff very friendly and are server took all 5 of are orders from memory and everting was correct , very impressive. We will be back even if the wait is over an hour . I cannot down grade Kuzzos because of the wait time , the Restraunt truly is one of a kind. 5 stars it is"
3/9/2018,2 star rating,"My boyfriend has been wanting to check this place out since September and we finally made it in for dinner. This place was super busy for 4:30pm on a Thursday, we were very surprised. We didn't have to wait for a table like most of the other reviewers did but the service was very slow. There was only one server for the entire ""dining room"". We waited so long in between visits, for example, it took about 15 minutes to get two glasses of water because she was getting drinks for all the other tables, I felt so bad. The food was just OK. Like I said we have been wanting to try this place out for a few months now and it was just disappointing. The cheese grits had so much butter on them that I basically had to scoop it off and the $11 Long Island ice tea had a monster Kool-Aid ice cube in it that made the dink too sweet. Also, the parking is terrible."
6/30/2018,2 star rating,"I left Kuzzo's with a bad taste in my mouth. And it wasn't the food. I don't think I will be going back there. I was on the Avenue of Fashion for an event at a neighboring business and decided to have a late lunch. Kuzzo's looked like a good neighborhood hangout. I ordered at the bar, from barstaff who looked like she'd have rather been elsewhere. Once I put in my order, she never came back round again to see if I needed anything. My order of chicken tenders and a waffle arrived over 30 minutes later. It was decent but nothing special. And the bar waitress apparently expected me to eat with my hands. But I must say that she gave excellent service to a group of her friends who came in later. So there is proof that she wasn't completely incompetent."
8/4/2019,5 star rating,"Love, love, love this place - and it's not just because it's close to my house, but because the drinks are strong, the food never disappoints as it melts in your mouth, and the wait staff is informative and fun.  Remember, I said the drinks are strong, but you can't go wrong with the Tom Collins or the Long Island - who knew I wanted kool aid in either of those???   Then there is the chicken and waffles, grits and any sides.  It's worth a couple extra minutes at the gym. The crowd flows in at 10/1030am on the weekend so I like to get there a little early (and start the buzz)"
9/8/2018,4 star rating,"Heard alot of good things about Kuzzos so checked it out today. Parking was confusing but found spot not to far of a walk. Place was packed and was told 25 min wait but we were seated instantly. Waitress came over quick and took our order. My pop I ordered was just sparkling water but was given the Kuzzos lemonade/koolaide instead whuch I enjoyed! The wait was about 30 mins (menu said 20-25 min wait for fresh chicken) but the food was fresh, hot and very tastey! We ordered the ""what up doe"" and had 3 large chicken wings, 2 yummy stacked waffles, also came with potatos and eggs. Everything was delish! My only cons are, parking, the music was alittle too loud and the place was kind of small. Overall loved it, nice staff, friendly peeps and good eats."
4/14/2019,4 star rating,"Ok.   If you're looking for great service,  this is not your place.   On a Saturday morning, our server told us they did not have clean coffee mugs, so all the coffee was being served in a to go cup.  And by the way,  we never got the hot sauce.  Now if you go here for what I would describe as the most incredible chicken waffles in the midwest, this your place.   Simply stated, the chicken and waffles are incredible!"
8/10/2018,4 star rating,"This place was good overall. Drinks were good, waffles, and the special sauce chicken. But the server was a little slow to bring us our checks, we got places to be and we out here waiting like 10 more mins. She was super friendly tho!!! Def sold the items and made us want everything. Didn't charge for the pecans on my waffles that I asked for so I appreciate  She did charge a dolla for the special sauce I added on to my Tender Love, which is foine."
5/16/2018,3 star rating,"The food was not that good. I usually go to new Center eatery downtown, and this was a first time trying this and it wasn't that tasty. The waffle was soggy, chicken wasn't really seasoned, and macaroni and cheese was cheesy and bland. It was worth trying, but I don't believe I will go back again it's too overpriced to taste like something you could of made at home. The Kool aid was gooooodd that was the best and only good thing that was purchased with my meal. I drove 20 Mins away but at least I can say I've tried it out. Save your coins.. and try new center eatery."
10/22/2017,2 star rating,"This place has been on my ""need to try"" list for quite some time and I finally visited this weekend. It was busy for a Saturday but only had a wait of 15 min to be seated. It was much smaller and tightly packed than I would have guessed online from other photos. It took almost a half hour for food to come and we were sort of disappointed when it came out. We ordered mixed koolaid and It. Was. Sweet. Inedible, in my opinion. I understand the appeal of koolaid on this type of menu and what they're trying to do but in my family, if you pour too much sugar in the koolaid, you won't be allowed to make it again LOL The chicken had a decent flavor but it was inconsistent. At our table, the wings and drumsticks were okay but all of the thighs were way too salty. One plate had a ""breast"" that looked like the cutlet was mostly removed and it was basically a fried breast bone. I ordered the Big Mama so I could sample the sides; greens, mac and cheese and ""candied yams"". The yams were the biggest disappointment which tasted like plain, boiled or canned potatoes that sat in a sweet water. Nothing ""candied"" or that roasted, spiced sweetness you expect. Whoever is making the koolaid, should switch to Yams duty LOL Mac and cheese could have been good if it had been reheated enough. The cheese in mine had clumped and congealed from obviously sitting in a large pre-made batch. The greens were good, with an extra shake of salt. My husband got a What Up Doe and his waffle was delicious and huge. They put a ridiculous pile of cold butter on top, which ended up in a napkin. His hash browns were mushy and flavorless. My son wanted a grilled cheese and fries. The sandwhich seemed to only be toasted and not buttered like a traditional grilled cheese and was made with thick texas toast and only one thin slice of cheese. As you can imagine, it had a very dry, ""white bread"" flavor. Fries were limp, soggy and unsalted. Our table spent $100+ on food that should've came out flawless for the neighborhood it's in and it tasted like it was made by people who don't understand soul food.We liked the atmosphere, it was decorated nicely and our server was great. The food however, won't bring us back."

I had the dark and lovely which was good. I suggest the Kool-aid drink. They have this one drink that has the lemonade, blue kool-aid and purple kool-aid mixed together. They have different names for it like suicide, superman and I forgot  the other most common name. It was good and sweet just like when you made it when you was a kid."

6/11/2019,1 star rating,"Not worth the visit unfortunately. First off, battling the construction is a nightmare. Horrible service and racist! Upon entering we had to wait for someone to come out of the kitchen to sit us. We ordered our drinks and food and waited and waited and waited. Other tables were sat after us and received their drinks (all were African American). We ended up leaving because of how bad it was. We came to this area to try good bakes and cake and thought we'd give this place a try since it was in the same center. Please take my advice and go elsewhere."
4/19/2018,5 star rating,"I had been looking for a place that served REAL fried chicken and waffles as opposed to chicken tenders, and found one that hit the spot.Went for a weekend brunch, and waited around 30-45 minutes to be seated. The waiting area in the back near the bathrooms is less than ideal, but is still a place to sit. The service was a little slow, but they were pretty busy so will give the benefit of the doubt. My boyfriend got the kuzzo's long island to drink, which was a great decision. A very tasty, yet strong drink, and comes with a large blue kool-aid ice cube.Onto the food: the chicken is truly the star of the show. The crunch on the chicken is incredibly satisfying, and the meat is juicy and tender. I'm particularly partial to the wings, which, I should add, are very decently sized.The waffles are not the crispy belgian waffles you may be envisioning, and are a little on the soft/soggy side, but are still fluffy and go well with the chickenWould definitely come back the next time I'm craving chicken and waffles. I would set aside around 1.5-2 hours for the whole dining experience, which includes wait time. It's more of a place for a leisurely brunch rather than somewhere to eat if you have an event to go to afterward!"
11/27/2017,4 star rating,"Kuzzos has really come around. I've waited over a year to post a review to truly see progress as a new restaurant in the area.Although, in past visits the customer service has struggled, I'm happy to share the service has improved greatly. We arrived to Kuzzos early Wednesday morning just about 9 when they opened. We were immediately greeted and seated. The server approached us immediately to introduce herself. She took our drink orders and quickly brought them back. My daughter and I ordered traditional breakfasts', while my husband opted for fried chicken and pancakes. Last time we came my husband had to wait at least 30 minutes for his chicken order ( I can imagine this may still be the case during peak hours), however, this time, we only waited 10 minutes.A great experience and I'm happy to share! I would highly recommend going to Kuzzos during the week when they first open to get optimal experience."
6/29/2019,1 star rating,Kuzzos was bad.  Everything was sticky from the table to floor even the chairs.  When I sat down I just thought it was the table but the back of my skirt was wet from kool aid. I told my waitress and she said she would have the manager come over she never came they said she was out doing errands. The food has changed it came to the table lukewarm and just tasted bad the waffles were soggy and the chicken had a vinegary taste.  The kool aid is still good though if you're just going for a drink. I know I really should have left but I was trying to wait for the manager but in the end it was just bad.
8/9/2020,1 star rating,Service was absolutely the young lady at who was taking orders on the inside Chantel I think her name is was horrible. She was extremely rude and nasty I could not get my full order in before she kept cutting me off. She had my order out into the system wrong because I was missing food. If you have we employees that does not want to work and service the public maybe they need to find somewhere else to work. Even when picking up my order about 30 minutes layer her attitude was still bad she never apologized for this mix up she just walked away and said nothing. Because of her actions I will not return to this business.
7/26/2017,4 star rating,"Finally a low southern type cooking in Yankee territory! Fried chicken was well seasoned and very flavourful and the waffles altho very tastey could have been a lil crispier but the Shrimp & Grits were on point! Well seasoned  (they definitely salt the water before adding the grits Amen!) to the tender shrimp with pieces of bacon, onions and peppers a can't miss dish! To wash it all down with.....Red Kool-Aid! A childhood favorite!"
8/23/2018,2 star rating,"This was my first visit to Kuzzos and I'm not sure if I want to ever go back.  We arrived at 12:35P on a Tuesday when it was half empty.  We had a party of 7.  Five of us were already waiting and 2 were parking but we had to wait another 8 min for them to walk in before all of us could be seated.   We were seated for over 30 minutes before we got water.  We watched our waitress Tandra (who was horrible) tend to other tables that got there after us before she finally took our orders almost an hour after we were seated.  I finally got up to complain and then our food came out.  She forgot one person's order.  She never came back to check on our table.  Our grits were served cold, although the chicken, fish and waffles were hot and tasted good. It took forever to get our bill.  Another waitress came out to ask for our orders AGAIN so she could bill us.  When asked where our original waitress was, we were told she was ""handling business.""In a nutshell, food was decent.  Atmosphere was cozy, but service was TERRIBLE.  Work on the service and serve the food hot and this place could be a winner!"
8/29/2017,1 star rating,After reading some of the review's and the fact the owner or a representative has never addressed anything anyone has said or complained about tells me this is not a place for me! I was going to go tomorrow but i dont feel like getting pissed off!

I called and spoke to Kenya (manager). She was very pleasant, understanding and promised to make things right. Kenya called me back on Monday and gave me a store credit for my family's meal. Talk about above and beyond. My family and I are very appreciative and any bad feeling was forgotten and forgiven. The food was very good as it always is but Kenya's customer service was second to none. Thank you and we will see you again soon."
7/6/2017,4 star rating,"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time and am glad I did!!! My wife and I went for lunch. Greeted and promptly seated by a friendly hostess. Waitress was also nice and I ordered the chicken tenders with a waffle called "" tender love"" on the menu. I was really hungry so also ordered a side of mac cheese. All were excellent and I was especially surprised at how wonderful the chicken tenders were, these were crispy and really yummy. My wife had a turkey burger and fries which she really liked as well. All in all, an awesome place that I look forward to returning to soon!!!"
11/18/2017,4 star rating,"We got seated relatively quickly, and must have lucked out with no line. I got set up with some coffee and ordered the Ellie May Breast with a side of the waffle so that I could try everything. I liked the fried chicken, egg, waffle, hot sauce, and syrup combination. Our orders were mixed up a bit, and we had to move around items on our plates to make sure we got what we ordered. It worked out. They did seem to have an issue cooking bacon to make it crispy. It was more on the chewy side after sending it back 2 times, and then it didn't really get eaten because of that. Our waitress didn't get to make it back to our table to refill coffee as often so she made up for it by giving us to-go cups which was nice. The prices are reasonable and the chicken is nice and crispy and had good seasoning."
8/4/2015,4 star rating,"I love chicken and waffles and Kuzzos doesn't fail. I hate to wait on line, but other than that, I love this eatery. The variety of food is incomparable to other places in the area. I recently tried the red velvet waffle, which was very tasty as it was sweet, but not overly sweet. Same impression with the kool-aid, it was refreshing, not ""diabetes in a cup"" like some places make. (Not making light of the medical condition...just making a point.) The wait staff is always friendly and the food comes to table swiftly. The prices, in my opinion are spot-on. I really enjoy this place."
8/4/2015,5 star rating,"Customer Service: I was thoroughly impressed with this place. We came in and were greeted with enthusiasm and great customer service. They asked if it was our first time. I said yes and they exclaimed, ""We hope you enjoy the experience!"" When we sat down, before we could notice, the bus boy came and wiped down the table. The waitress had great energy, she knew the menu and made a ton of great suggestions! Food: We ordered the dark and lovely, kool-laid, mac n cheese, collard greens, and waffles. Everything was good! Drinks: The drinks are highly priced but tasty."

Awful service, mediocre food-really expensive for the quality. I got the biscuit and gravy...could not eat them. Tasteless/bland. The eggs were okay (scrambled with cheese) and the breakfast potatoes were blah. Friends got the Big Poppa which was ""boring"" they say.My wife got the chicken tenders which were good-juicy but defiantly not worth the wait and the money. We won't be back here and when others ask, we are honest-don't waste your time."
6/25/2020,1 star rating,Called in food took over an hour after arriving. Piss poor service still! Ask to speak to a manager and was told they don't compensate for wait times. Then on top of that I get home and missing items from my order!
4/9/2015,2 star rating,"Most important to a chicken and waffles joint are the CHICKEN and WAFFLES. The chicken was pretty good, the waffles were horrible. We agreed they were more like pancakes or injera than waffles. They might even be from frozen. Shrimp and grits was fantastic. Cocktails were drinkable and big but very sugary and much too expensive at $12 for a basic margarita. The service was slower than slow, and not just because we came with a group of 8. Everyone seemed to be waiting a loooong time The staff was very nice and earnest thought they never recognized or mentioned the extreme wait or that we were bussing our own table. The sides were great! And the red velvet waffle was very good, and clearly made from a real live waffle iron. Please, Kuzzos! Get a real waffle game and step up your ticket time! We want to want to come back."

The fruit sides must have been prepped days ago..."
10/9/2017,5 star rating,"At the risk of ruining my own secret, the time to come to Kuzzo's is dinner.Why? Because brunch is a madhouse. If you must have Kuzzo's in the morning, then be prepared to wait, especially if you're coming later in the morning with the rest of the church crowd. Don't say I didn't warn you!But once you get your food the long wait will be forgotten. Check their specials for creative options--my favorite is the Motor City Blues, a blueberry waffle with blueberry butter and tenders, which is divine all together with a bit of the syrup. The plate with three sides is a good option, because the greens are perfect. And any waffle and chicken combo is gonna be good. If you're into eggs and other options, there's stuff for you, too.But do me a favor and get the biscuits. I don't care if you already have a waffle, not only are more starches always better, but the biscuits are some of the best I've had, lacquered with honey and perfectly soft.And with all the above and a glass of lemonade? Perfection."

Got my usual order today, the Bam Bam, and the drumsticks were even smaller than last time. Second time this has happened. The drumstick is literally the size of a drumette off a wing. Sadly, won't be ordering from this place until a change has been made."

11/4/2018,1 star rating,"Honestly it's that good! Maybe it was a mix of the super fun waitress Benta, music, decor and food  I loved and would definitely go back again. Update: 11-04-18 What has happened to this place? The service has become terrible! The host: she was actually rude to most people who complained about the long wait. We waited for over an hour to be seated and then 15 minutes for the waitress to show up and then she has this attitude as if we are an inconvenience she has to deal with. No smile or welcoming tone. I get it this place is really busy which should mean more servers! People have waited around so long first to be seated and then for food and then to just pay their bill. Come here if you have nothing else planned for your day because you're not getting out less than 4 hours and no one cares. I loved this place the first few times I came here... but I think more investment needs to be made into maybe hiring additional servers/busboys. Employees don't seem too happy with their jobs so maybe something needs to be done there as it's effecting how they treat people coming in. I just wasted a 3.5 hours of my day and at this point the food wasn't even worth it! Chicken was dry and so hard to cut through! Oh and cherry on top of this insane experience, the waitress doesn't bring back my full change. Idc if it was only 52 cents but why assume it's ok not to? If you actually read through this novel or complains, you can probably tell I'm pissed for my wasted time and money."

2/18/2015,4 star rating,"I was super excited about trying Kuzzos! I first heard about it on the news and I immediately loved the back story. If you don't know the story, Ron Bartell, the owner, is a Detroit native and former NFL player. Anyhow, back to the review...When we walked in the place was packed! This was two weeks before their official grand opening. The tables and bar area were packed. There were about six people waiting ahead of us. We waited for about 45 minutes before we were able to get a spot at the bar. We probably would have had to wait an hour for a table. We placed our orders and were quickly given large mason jars of Kool-Aid and lemonade. You can also order mimosas, wine, Arnold Palmer, or just water. After waiting for about 10 minutes, the waitress told us that they were all out of Sweet Potato and Red Velvet Waffles (Nooooooooo! That's the only reason I'm giving this place 4/5 stars).  So I decided to get the Buttermilk Waffles, and she offered to add in pecans. I also ordered chicken tenders and grits. The food came about 10 minutes from then for a total of a 20 minute wait. Not bad for a new restaurant! When the food came there was ample syrup and butter and the food was hot. When I tell you my mouth was watering that does not do it justice. I couldn't wait to dive in and Kuzzos did not disappoint!! The waffles had hints of vanilla, cinnamon, and sugar! The chicken was crispy on the outside but soft and tender on the inside. The grits were seasoned well and had a good consistency. I'm getting hungry just writing about this! My companions ordered the salmon croquettes and a to-go order of shrimp and grits. They said it was delicious and I believe them. We also had a side order of mac and cheese that was really good. March 3, 2015 is their grand opening which will mean extended hours. Currently, they are only open from 8:00-2:00pm. The new hours will have them open until 9:00pm during the week and 10:00pm on the weekend. I will be back - and I'll be prepared to wait because this place is awesome!"

Then another waitress came to take my order it was just kept flip-flopping with waitresses is helping me i didnt know,  it's like they didn't know what they were doing the only reason I gave it 3 stars cuz it was my first time having chicken and waffles that  was so good!!!  I would like to go again but there no way in the would im waiting like i did.

1/29/2015,4 star rating,"My first Chix and waffles experience hails from Roscoe's in California and their notoriety is so well documented you almost don't even have to have tried it to believe the hype is real. Moving to MI I've been yearning for chicken and waffles and having had Addison Eatery's (terrible), this is by far much better by leaps and bounds! I was told to try New Center Eatery and Honest John's but never got the chance until Addison Eatery opened. Addison's has more of a cornmeal breading and it was over fried and therefore dry. The Belgian Waffle was too sour as though the buttermilk itself went sour. Few bites and we tossed it and went to Asian Corned Beef instead.But this is a review for Kuzzo's! Kuzzo's: (noun) term of endearment for one who is a friend or family member. A person of kindred, Culture, race or nation. Let's just say I was the only Asian chick and wasn't gonna be sayin' ""Wassup Kuzzo!"" to anyone. But in hindsight, the ambiance was so laid back and the patrons all kind and chill for 11am Thursday. Service was polite and quick with a lil' drink and order snafu but they quickly rectified it. I got the Trey Deuce ($11) which came with 2 waffles and 3 pieces of fried chicken (wing, drum and thigh). I requested all wings b/c I like more skin and breading than I do meat. I'm pretty sure they're a buttermilk fried chicken kinda place b/c the chicken was tender and fried perfectly as it was still juicy. The seasoning was equally perfect and not too salty. If you've been to Roscoe's then you know it's the thin waffle variety and not Belgian. Kuzzo's waffle while thin had better seasoning and it's rumored that that is the only batter that Ron Bartell himself makes. The family recipe has 11 secret spices in it and cinnamon is a dominating one. Not in a  snickerdoodle sweet waffle kind of way but very pronounced. And I'm not sure if it's just generic maple syrup but their maple syrup tasted Grade A to me and not overly sweet. My partner in crime got a chicken breast and waffle with a side order of hand cut fries and smothered shredded cheese (cures all hangovers) and that's where the order went wrong. They gave her chicken breast and cheesy fries but no waffle. Within 5 mins, a waffle came out like nothing wrong happened. Later, my girl wanted a refill on her Diet Coke (gross, I know!) but the server refilled it and gave it to the guy next to me (we sat at the bar) which he quickly took a sip not thinking about it. We both quickly laughed at him and he said, ""Hmmm, this isn't my grape Kool aid Huh?"" The server was embarrassed but it was all good. We later caught big burly guy Instagramming his food saying, ""My Gramma wanted to see what I was eating."" Uh huh. Sure, Kuzzo. ;)  I plan on coming back for the sweet potato waffle as I'm more of a thick Belgian waffle fan (now that I have a waffle maker too that the kind I like!). Red velvet pancake fans and rejoice knowing there's also a red velvet waffle but I just can't get on that red poop bandwagon. I also would love to try their shrimp and grits and side dishes which will be more visits to come.Kuzzo's is located in The Avenue of Fashion flanked by bead and hair salons. There's street parking but if you can't find any, park at Mike's Market and walk over. The area itself was probably once a lively strip and it appears to be very cute and has potential. Now onto New Center Eatery and Honest Johns!"
2/3/2015,2 star rating,"So, I was uber excited to try this hot new place. Probably wasn't a good idea to go the day after snowmageddon...the parking is HORRIBLE! Street parking that was hardly plowed at all. I did see a small parking lot but had no idea how to get to it. It was lunchtime, and the place was packed so we decided to grab a carry out. I kid you not, it took 50+ minutes for my carry out! Ordered the ""Sweet Daddy"" which is sweet potato Belgian waffle, chicken tenders and grits. Well, the chicken was great! The waffle was a weird mushy consistency and the grits weren't anything to write home about. On top of that they forgot my cheese. I was sadly disappointed. Probably won't be a frequent diner."
3/5/2017,5 star rating,"So we did come at what is the busiest time, Sunday morning about 1030.  The crowd was a bit larger than usual, so says Google.  They don't have enough space set aside to wait. Waiting in the hall leading to the restrooms with the high chairs and floor cleaning supplies isn't fun. They have a bar counter, and it was full of people, but it doesn't appear they serve food there.Took about an hour to get seated.  Our server arrived quickly, took or drink orders and provided us with the specials.  We asked about her favorite and she was more than happy to provide.  My red kool-aid was super sweet and tasty as was the lemonade colorful concoction so to was the sweet teaThe first lady (breast and waffle) was perfect.  Waffle house waffle style, which you just gotta love.  Chicken was done, not over done, not leaking everywhere  and definitely not dry.  Tasty sums it up.Food arrived quickly, I consumed it quickly and Then I paid the bill quickly.  I'll come back again next time we are in town!]"
4/27/2018,4 star rating,"WOW!! The chicken was just so perfectly fried. Golden & crunchy on the outside & tender & perfect on the inside! Went so well with the waffles!

Because the chicken & waffle was amazing and it's the star of their restaurant! So we got what we came for!"
12/17/2018,1 star rating,"Would give 0 stars if possible. The food was great the other time I was there about a year ago but when we went yesterday we had an hour wait to get in for 5 people. Had to wait 20min for drinks (water/coffee). Then another 1.5 hr for food that never came. After 1.5 hr the waitress finally came back to our table- she did not update us during this time on the status of our food nor offer us refills- to say the food was ""being plated."" Meanwhile another party across of us who came before us were also waiting on their food and eventually only received their food 1 plate at a time. Since the waitress said this we waited another 15-20min for the food to emerge and still nothing. Eventually we found the waitress and asked her what was happening. She immediately got defensive and said it wasn't her fault, the kitchen had a shift change problem and the food was still being ""plated."" At that time we decided to leave since it was evident we were getting served anytime soon. By the time we left the table across from us only had about 50% of their orders out. Very disappointed that the waitress didn't provide more updates or at least offer us some water during that long wait. Also very disappointed the manager didn't come by anyone's table to apologize for the service. Likely won't be backSide note: the carry out orders and bar orders were being filled in a timely manner... maybe better luck there?"
1/1/2016,2 star rating,"I was here on Christmas Eve, and the place was packed out. I'd brought my grandma for brunch, and my sister and her husband came along also. We had to wait a little for seating, which is fine, because we had a few minutes to window shop along the Avenue of Fashion. Once we were seated, we had prompt service. My brother-in-law loved the sweet tea, and my sister said their coffee was good. My grandma got the chicken and waffles, which she said were delicious. I had a biscuit (OMGoodness. So. Delicious.). The greens were okay but not amazing. I'm not a grits girl but the grits had a good flavor balance and were creamy, if you're into that. The only major issue (but it's a major issue for me) was how loud it was. There didn't seem to be any consideration of acoustics. I couldn't find a single thing placed in the room that would absorb sound. That's fine with a few people, but when a room is packed with people and dishes and so forth, it can get deafening. I'd go back, though New Center Eatery is my current favorite for chicken and waffles, and 1917 is my favorite place in the 7 and Livernois corridor.Update: the times I've been back, service has been worse and acoustics have still been as bad. The menu is unwieldy- there aren't that many options really, but the dizzying number of combinations gets complicated."
2/21/2017,3 star rating,"The namesake chicken and waffles here were delicious! I had a mad chicken and waffles craving, and am so glad I somehow stumbled upon this on yelp. The waffle was particularly memorable. The shrimp in the shrimp and grits were amazing as well, I thought the grits could've benefitted from a little more salt. Service was pretty good, we got seated way before our estimated wait time. The Kool Aid looked cool, but was way too sweet for my liking."

1/12/2017,2 star rating,"My boyfriend heard so much about this place so he texted me while at work asking me to bring him some. I asked him to call in his order and I would pick it up. Unfortunately he was told that they didn't except call-in orders because people don't pick up their orders. I walked into what seemed to be a nice cozy atmosphere. I attempted to order two orders of 3 wings and two waffles. The lady bar tender responded "" we have many different combos of wings and waffles do you mean the Trey Deuce""?  I'm respond OK I guess its called the ""Trey Deuce"" give me that. I sat for 25 mins waiting while the female bartender was talking to a male customer. He was telling her about his family. She then asked does your wife allow you to talk to women? Then she proceeded to pour a drink. He asked who it was for and the bartender said you I'm trying to get you ""turned up"". I felt that the conversation was totally inappropriate to be having with a married man especially when you have other customers are there.When I finally received my order I opened my box as always to check my meals and the chicken was cold. I told the lady at the bar that it was cold and she responded "" well I was waiting on your waffles!"" I couldn't understand because I thought this was a chicken and waffle place so they should have the timing down to a science. When I finally received my new order she brought it dropped it in front of me and walked away. She acted as if I was a problem even though I had said nothing besides my chicken is cold and I would like fresh chicken. I  thought that was only right since I paid $28 for two meals. I really wanted this to be a wonderful experience but I was very disappointed. Kuzzos lost me as a customer as well as my mate. They also lost many more potential customers as I have coworkers and a host of family and friends in the surrounding area. Word of mouth can make you or break you. Food:Chicken was fried hard like I enjoy it and seasoned really well.Waffles were soggy and inedible and over spiced with cinnamon.Advice: Please focus on customer service that is the only way to maintain success. Ladies keep it professional you can be sexy without trying to come on to someone else's spouse and you never know who is listening."
6/5/2015,3 star rating,"Tried this place while on my recent trip home. It seemed strange walking into the restaurant with memories of what it used to be....Anyhow, I got the chicken breast and waffle. I didn't anticipate that it would be a bone-in piece since I'm used to chicken and waffles where I live now being boneless and tender. The batter tasted pretty good, flavorful and well spiced, though the chicken was a bit dry.  The waffle was okay, though it tasted like the vanilla cinnamon pancakes I make at home. It was not hot as others have mentioned. A better quality syrup would have made it great. You're two steps from Canada, where's the maple?! My cousin had the omelette which was delicious and another cousin had the shrimp and grits which was decent as well.  Overall, it's not a bad experience, though the space is small and loud. But it was the perfect venue to welcome me back home after being away 9 years."
7/29/2017,5 star rating,"This was my first time visiting this restaurant. My sister in law said we had to try it. Well I have to say Kuzzos's has some of the best chicken & waffles in Detroit. Good atmosphere and excellent service as well. My wife ordered the "" Cuddin Pete"" with turkey bacon , I got the  ""Trey-Deuce"" and my sister in law ordered ""the First Lady"". My wife said the biscuit was really good. We'll be back soon."
3/12/2015,4 star rating,"I've been to Kuzzos on two different occasions now; both times were on a Saturday. The first Saturday, 2/21, that we went, our party of five arrived around 1:30 PM. The wait time for a table was one hour. We were finally seated  around that wait time, not sooner lol. It seemed to be some confusion with who would serve us. It was almost like we had two servers, I believe that this was due to a lack of communication. One of the servers we had was not very friendly at all. She seemed slightly annoyed and border line rude, but seemed to soften up as the time went by. I ordered the chicken breast and waffle with home fries. My food was really good. Pretty much everyone in our party ordered wings and waffles, grits and eggs. The only downside was that we got our orders at different times, also my dad's food was messed up, they gave him chicken wings instead of a chicken breast. Everyone in our party really enjoyed their food. My mom and I said that if we came back it would have to be earlier in the day or during the week because the wait time was too long. FYI  if you arrive after 9: 45 am there will most likely be a wait, so plan accordingly. Fast forward to last Saturday, 2/28. My mom and I woke up really early and arrived shortly after 9 AM. We were seated immediately and our server was very friendly. She took our order right away. I order the salmon patties along with a waffle and home fries. My mom ordered the chicken and waffles and I gave her my side of grits. The food was once again on point!  The waffles here are some of the best I have ever tasted. They remind me of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in Los Angles. The salmon patties were good as well, not the best I have ever tasted, but still pretty darn good. I think we were in and out in about an hour and a half. Kuzzos was definitely starting to get crowded before we even left. There was a nice amount of people waiting for carry-out orders too.Overall, I really enjoy Kuzzos. I will be back. On certain areas I will chuck it up to them being a fairly new establishment. I hope they can get a better system/ procedure down when it comes to the wait times and carry-out orders. I also think that all the servers should have positive attitudes, ones without need to go ASAP.  I really want this place to succeed. It is a great addition to the Avenue of Fashion and most importantly the city. It would also be nice if they could get a parking lot, because as other have mentioned finding parking is difficult. Complimentary Valet parking would be a nice addition too. Also this place does tend to get a very loud, which could deter  people from wanting to come back."
2/17/2017,4 star rating,"I could have sworn I left a review when I came here half a year ago...After reading some reviews about how busy it gets during the weekends, I decided to go on a week day morning. It was the best choice because there were plenty of tables open and we were served quite well. The triple flavor Koolaid is a must try for first timers. There is a science to layering beverages, tasty science. I went with the dark and lovely platter with a side of mac 'n cheese and was not disappointed. The drumstick and thigh were seasoned and battered well. The waffle was crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. The staff were so friendly and the food came out quickly. I cannot wait to visit again!!!"
7/14/2017,1 star rating,"I gave them a year, over a year after they opened and after my first terrible experience before I went here again. Went during a non-busy time, service was painfully slow, food came out cold and didn't taste great at all. Nope! Sorry can't do CP time guys. Won't be back again. Had hopes but I will never recommend this place to anyone. Too bad, it had such potential too."
2/28/2015,2 star rating,"So while this place is still growing and learning and has had a lot of attention from the media and TONS of pressure from the community to see it succeed, it of course is far from perfect. However having said that, it still doesn't negate my experience this morning just because they're new.I called at 9:45 to place a carry out order and was put on hold...for 5min. I decided to hang up and call back. When it eventually went through at 10am they took my order and said that I had to pay over the phone first before picking up - fine, no prob. She had to take my card info twice because the computer gave her issues and was asking for my street address and other info. Weird. Anyway I ordered The Big Red which is 1 red velvet waffle with 3 chicken tenders or pieces (I got tenders) 1 side (I got cheesy grits) and bourbon syrup, and I added a side of eggs. My total was $20.67 and I was told 20min. The total sounded rather high to me but I had already hung up the phone and decided to just wait till I picked up to see why it was high. I figured maybe they had a $5 carry out fee or something.I walk in at 10:30 and wait in the carry out line in the back by the bathrooms. I expected to just walk in and grab my order and go right? I already paid and ordered unlike the three people before me and the continuous stream of customers off the street behind me for carry out - they all were walk ins. ONE HOUR LATER, I am not over exaggerating,  did I finally walk out with my food!!As I was waiting, and waiting, I was getting upset that others were getting their orders before me. I inquired about it and was told my order wasn't up yet. Another 15, order still not up as again others are getting their orders when they came in after me. I was told the red velvet takes 12min to cook and that since I had two was the reason why. Firstly I called in my order at 10, even if you're busy you cannot justify a waffle taking an hour. Secondly, I only ordered one waffle. So my order finally comes out (with an extra waffle and no cheesy grits) and when I have to sign I dispute the check due to the extra waffle - hence the extra $5 I was wondering about. They apologize and say they'll take it off but it would be a few minutes (!!!). After trying what voodoo magic they could with the register, and me standing there with growing cold food for 15min they couldnt change the charge. Now I've been a saint this entire time, not being rude or giving attitude. They felt bad, were trying to correct their mistakes, and it could clearly see it. Kudos to them - but I was still furious on the inside and I have no poker face, lol.FINALLY they just comp the meal and gave me cash back. Several people come and apologize and the manager (I think?) comes and gets involved. So after placing an order at 10am, I finally had it at 11:35 as I walked out.  The food was of course cold by the time I got home (just near 8mi and Woodward, so 5min away) and I didn't get any butter or bourbon syrup, it was regular. BUT it was free in the end.In summation, the staff is great and they'll be fine in the future. They know how to correct their errors. Sadly their kitchen staff is clearly slow and unorganized which makes for unacceptable wait times for food. Had I dined in it would have been the same issue - me waiting for an hour for a 12min waffle. I won't recommend it right now, wait till they've been open for a few months then check it out. As for the food, the waffle was good (wish it had icing), but the chicken and grits were nothing spectacular - personally not worth my time. I will go back though, in the summer, and I'm pretty optimistic I'll be able to update this with a much better experience and review. I really do think they'll be successful in the long run."
3/28/2017,4 star rating,"This is a late review. I went to kuzos a few weeks ago. I love the atmosphere. They have 2 sides to the restaurant and a full bar.  The service was good. I ordered the chicken and waffles of course which was really good. I loved the chicken, it was really moist and crispy. I was just surprised with the size of the chicken; it's huge!!! Like HGH huge or maybe they brime them in something but they do taste great. The waffles are good but I prefer thicker and more crispy waffles. These are more like pancakes.  That look like waffles but they still tasted great."
6/4/2017,5 star rating,"I'm rating this on the Detroit scale, in which everything is given one more star than it would receive in many other locales.Kuzzo's seemed to be an interesting place.  Upon walking in, there is a bar to the left, a small room crowded with booths and tables to the right.  The waiting area is quite small, and there appears to always be a wait.  The hostess took my number and texted when the table was ready.  The restaurant is loud and crowded, but not so much as to be intolerable unless you're looking for a quiet breakfast.Service was short but friendly.  I opted for some dark meat, a waffle, collard greens and some red kool-aid.The chicken was basically room temperature but it was cooked well. The leg was great, the thigh was tiny but the taste was solid. Not overdone, just flavorful and moist.The greens were on point.The waffle was soft/slightly undercooked like you'll generally find at Waffle House, but buttered up and covered in their great syrup, it hit the spot.It's a bold move to charge $3.50 for a mason jar full of Kool-Aid, but it was bold and sweet.  Very refreshing, and well worth it, if only on occasion.All  in all, it would be a four star experience in many large cities, but Yelp in this area is skewed in such away that giving this restaurant four stars would let it get lost in the mire of other restaurants that don't bring this level of food to the table."
5/7/2017,5 star rating,"One of my favorite restaurants in the whole wide world. Prior to my visit to the Detroit area, I came across this place and studied/drooled over the photos of their drinks, food, and their menu. Everything I had heard of this place lived up to its name. The Kool-Aid: perfect. Waffles: delicious. Fried chicken: savory. Ranch dressing: creamy. Bloody Mary: spicy. I would gladly order it and have it flown to NYC. SO DELICIOUS."
11/28/2017,4 star rating,"Minus one star for the wait time. Only go if you have a lot of time, the turn over here does not seem very high. Arrived and was put on a waiting list for three people. Was told it would only be about 15 minutes, ended up being about 30 minutes. It was still worth the wait, we were greeted immediately and put in our orders quick because we were all starving. The food took a really long time to come out. I had biscuits and gravy, and the other two people in my party ordered chicken and waffles. The food was delicious! Chicken was juicy, waffles were similar to pancakes and were thin, biscuits were soft all around and the bottom had a bit of a crunch to them, which I like. Great staff and service, our server knew the menu and was able to suggest some dishes to us. Only issue was the wait times."
10/28/2015,4 star rating,"Soo good. Tia really took care of us. My first time trying chicken and waffles and I wasn't disappointed. Mac and Cheese = delicious. My BF says he likes it better than Slows. Potatoes = delicious. In a mix with onions and peppers. For desert we had the deep fried Oreos, again yum. For all of the food that we had, I was surprised that the bill wasn't crazy. Great food and good prices, can't beat that. Did I mention their delicious lemonade/Kool-aid? I will definitely be going back for more!"
10/21/2017,5 star rating,We had a Bloody Mary (Yum) and a Mimosa.Then I had the Ellie Mae and my husband had 2 chicken drumsticks and a waffle.The food was amazing. I was so stuffed I couldn't even eat the potatoes my breakfast came with.The grits are out of this world!Loved this place
12/5/2015,5 star rating,Finally! Made it here...great food. Not a bad wait time. Service is good and great music playing in the background. I can't wait to bring out of town guests! I'll definitely be back.
3/29/2017,4 star rating,"I really loved this place. My daughter took me here after a visit at Specs Howard. She was raving so much about it I just had to check it out.  Wow! I ordered the belle Isle basket and she ordered salmon croquettes, cheese eggs and cheese grits. The shrimp with hand-cut fries were phenomenal.  Also that southern style kool-aid was off the chain. (the kool-aid is not for everybody, very sugary) next time I go I'll check out the red velvet waffles and chicken. This is definitely a place to check out.  The one negative is it has a single stall for both the women and the men."
1/22/2017,4 star rating,"This place is nice. The food is amazing! I've been here 4 times and they always are consistent with it.  The service have been mediocre at best every time I come. Overall, it's a really nice atmosphere and the people are nice.I think that the service is not so good because the kitchen is always backed up."
5/17/2020,2 star rating,"Breading on tenders tastes fine, but the chicken, itself, is completely flavorless. Waffle is good but they didn't give me syrup or butter or a fork. Greens only have pepper flakes flavor. Didn't get my drink. Orders piled up in the corner so food is cold. All three voicemail boxes are full."
6/20/2020,3 star rating,"The food is great, but the entire staff lacks any sense of urgency. The  vibe of the restaurant is always unorganized and mildly hostile, not outright rude, but you're definitely made to feel as though any request is bothersome and that you should be grateful for the begrudging service you're getting. Plan to wait a minimum of twenty minutes to place your order and another forty to receive the food."
2/10/2017,4 star rating,"Love this place. Went on a Sunday at 11am with 6 friends it was very busy. Wait was about 30 minutes sat down and had a very nice server. The food was wonderful, cooked actually perfect. I love fried chicken and kuzzo can cook chicken. Wasn't bland and wasn't over seasoned. The food took about 30 minutes to come."
5/10/2019,2 star rating,"I read the reviews after my experience, I should have read them first. The food was amazing. I had the catfish and it was southern fried hmmm hmmm. That said, one reviewer said it was a 30 minute wait from the time they were seated till the time they were served. We were able to beat that time by 30 min. It was well over an hour from the time we were seated till the time we received the last meal. We asked to see the manager and it took another 15 min for the manager to show."
7/2/2018,4 star rating,"We meet some friends there gor a birthday celebration. The food was very good with decent portions, nice atmosphere and friendly staff. However we had to wait a very long time for our food. They did give us a discount after we asked. My daugher had chix and waffles and I had the Ellie Mae (chix eggs grits potatoes biscuit). Everything tasted good. We ordered chix, collards, mac and chez with cornbread to go. Greens were very good but wasn't impressed with the mac and chez. Someone in our party ordered shrimp and grits, which looked good and she enjoyed it.Will definitely go back."
3/28/2015,4 star rating,"Visited for the first time this morning.  We were told the wait would be 20 minutes but it was less than five minutes (awesome). The kids loved their kool-aid. I was disappointed that the waitress didn't mention the small size but who can really complain about too much kool-aid right?My son and I split the ""what up doe"" and my daughter order the Lala. Our eggs were missing from the order and she had to return for other pieces of our order.  The service overall was average considering the wait time for our food and the extra expense that the waitress failed to mention. By the time we left, the place was packed (11am).  We will return to try some of what other patrons were enjoying!"
11/5/2017,5 star rating,"First time going there! We had a wait time about 30 minutes. Decided to enjoy their Bloody Mary's while we waited. Absolutely delicious! I got mine less spicy, but it still had a nice kick. Dill pickle & green olives added to the great taste. We were seated & our wonderful waitress was right there once we were settled in. Our food arrived in a very timely manner considering they were very busy. My waffle & chicken tenders were very tasty. I would definitely order this again. The ranch dressing made the chicken tenders taste even better. The tenders were fried to perfection!"
4/3/2017,4 star rating,"Super busy - had to park off in a neighborhood. Love that Good Cakes and Bakes is right next door - but how can I find room for Ooey Gooey Butter Cake (like chess pie in a cake) when I am full of Red Velvet Waffles???Great vibe, crowd, cocktails, food. I wish the space was bigger - I was with one friend and we were fine but if we had a bigger party not sure I could have really socialized. The space is pretty tight and acoustics a bit challenging."
12/7/2017,3 star rating,"Super super slow. Long waits. When they say a one hour wait, assume it will be at least 2.  Food was ok. Chicken is amazing. Koop-aid is great. The rest of the food is just average. Nice neat spot, good wait staff, but not worth 3 hours of my time (2 for waiting, one for dining."
4/23/2019,1 star rating,Terrible food and cold hardly ate anything asked for my bill to be adjusted NOT FREE. Unfortunately the manager told me there was nothing he could do and he also said plenty of people think it's gross as well  wish I would've read reviews first
3/13/2019,3 star rating,"Service sucks, the food is pretty good but the customer service could be better. They also need a better ordering option for carry outs. For now, you have to physically come in and order your carry out in an already busy restaurant."
12/20/2017,1 star rating,I'm really baffled by what was supposed to be shrimp and cheese grits they didn't make my food right at all and I'm so discussed that I don't want my money back they can have it to buy more grits and cheese this is nothing more than water and a spoon full of grits I give this place 4 thumbs down if I had 4 arms terrified from this point on....!!!!!
3/24/2015,2 star rating,First of all it took an hour to get our order and 15 minutes to get syrup for our order!  Ordered the What up doe meal (comes with two waffles three pieces of chicken one bowl of grits and two eggs) The waffles were flat and soggy! I was very disappointed.  For $15 I was expecting a Belgian waffle not something I could make at home.  Next time I'll go to Coney Island instead.
12/10/2015,5 star rating,"The food is exceptional!!!! I don't know what the previous reviews of unhappiness was about but today as we drove by the long lines were shorter. It must have been our lucky day. I loved the ambiance, the decor, and the music. Shanae was our server. She was professional, she gave excellent customer service, and she gave great recommendations. My hubs & I both got wings, THE red velvet waffle, and Mac and cheese. Everything was awesome! Including the big ass kool aid :) We will return definitely, it's another one of our Detroit gems. -The Detroit Doll"
7/7/2017,5 star rating,"Enjoyed my chicken and waffles at Kuzzo's! The shop is really cute and the service was good. I enjoyed my dish, the Tender Love. The waffles weren't crispy but had a good flavor (cinnamon-y); they kind of reminded me of waffle house waffles. The chicken was fried perfectly; it was light and delicious."
8/20/2015,5 star rating,"Loved it. The food, drinks and atmosphere was great. I was worried about the wait after the reviews I read. We were lucky we got right in. This was my first visit and I'll certainly be back. Highly recommend this place."
8/25/2016,5 star rating,"Let's begin with the staff. Exceptional. They are welcoming and just so nice. Have questions about anything and they are happy to explain and give their opinions. With two visits, both times I loved the staff. Let's now continue onto the food. So far I've tried their Big Red, Buttermilk Waffle, Chicken Tenders, Cheesy Grits, Shrimp and Grits, Kool-Aid, Catfish, Cornbread, Candied Yams, and Bourbon Maple Syrup. Everything we tried, wow. I wish the waffles were cooked just a little bit more to make them crunchy. Who am I kidding, everything was great.Without getting into great detail on each item, because this review would get painfully long, how about just a quick summary since each one was so delicious. Both waffles are so flavorful and different and fantastically carby. The chicken is tender, juicy, and crunchy, I could eat those all day. Cheesy Grits, we'll they are exactly that, creamy, buttery, and only lightly cheesy. Shrimp and Grits, it's seriously buttery and creamy, shrimp were large and excellent tasting with bits of bacon, nice touch. The Kool-Aid will bring you back to your kid days, but boy is it sugary. Get ready for a sugar rush. The catfish is flaky and the breading is just outstanding. It had that Cornbread style breading that when I think about it now, makes me want to have some immediately. The Cornbread and yams are wonderful sweet sides. Lastly, the maple syrup has a nice kick to it. At first, it has a Bourbon kick, you forget about it or try their other syrup and then go back. Ooo, you get to enjoy that kick again. I truly can't wait to return and look for excuses to come back."
5/31/2017,1 star rating,20 minute wait for a waitress when the place is 70% empty. My drink was supposed to be a ginger lemonade mint vodka drink. It was $11 I wouldn't pay $4 for the drink I received. Tasted like powdered lemonade and never tasted any ginger ...when the menu said fresh ginger. They took it back and added something but it still didn't tase like ginger then they said the mix was infused with ginger. Either way I didn't like it at all.Our table was next to the window and the entire time we were swatting small green bugs. We looked up and the window was covered with them. I said something to the manager and he just looked at them and didn't say or do anything. The bugs were still there when we left.The chicken I got seemed reheated and was very dry. Not much taste. The waffle was good. ..the reason I gave one star. I ordered the green bean side. The beans were so overcooked and mushy and salty I never finished them I won't be returning.
5/15/2019,1 star rating,"Waited for our food for over 45min.  I had the red velvet waffle 3piece wing and Mac & cheese. once I received the food she informed me no Mac and cheese. So gave me potatoes, which were very salty and cold. the chicken was extremely cold ,I had to send back for some more cold food. the waffle was horrible. My waitress was very pleasant she said she was going to take something of my 47$ bill lol she took off $1.40 which is fine but she could of kept that on I drove in from Vegas visiting and every one had spoke good on Kuzzos well my brother in law who demolished his food. But it was a dissatisfying experience.  Koolaid was ok"
11/5/2016,4 star rating,"Finally made it on a Saturday early afternoon and was pleasantly surprised/satisfied that it lived up to the hype and doesn't seem to be trying to do too much. We both had variations on chicken and waffles and thought regular and red velvet waffles were tasty. Not the best chicken I've ever had but good as well. And the coffee was better than I expected. Lots of people were drinking and they were moving the mixed drinks pretty quick, so I'd try some next time I'm there."
1/5/2018,5 star rating,"Big Red gives me LIFE! I was never really a fan of chicken and waffles growing up but I had a friend in town who wanted to check the place out. So, I decided to give it a shot and ordered Big Red. Big Red is a  red velvet waffle served with 3 wings or tenders, 1 side and bourbon maple syrup. I picked the tenders and mac & cheese as my side. Everything was DIVINE! The chicken was well seasoned and juicy. The mac & cheese can't compare to my mom's but that's an extremely high bar to reach, however it was really good. That red velvet waffle though... I could swear I was drooling... it was that good. Put that waffle, chicken, and syrup together and hello taste bud heaven.I would definately recommend this place. The staff was friendly and prompt, the atmosphere was chill, and the food is amazing.I'm proof that your taste really does change with age because now I'm a chicken and waffle fan."
1/1/2018,5 star rating,"Great spot! I love their cinnamon and pecan waffles and their chicken is so juicy. I recommend the ""Tender Love"" with a side of ranch. Also the koolaid is sooo good, sometimes it is too sweet just ask for more ice. They do not take carry out orders which is annoying because they get super busy for breakfast in the morning especially on the weekends."
1/7/2017,5 star rating,"Kuzzo's hands down has the best chicken & waffles in the City of Detroit. The restaurant is cozy and the waitstaff is extremely polite. I ordered the Tender Love chicken strips and waffle with sweet tea and mac & cheese on the side and everything was done to perfection. The chicken strips were crispy and the chicken was extra tender (the name won't lie to you)! I brought a friend and she had the What up Doe - she brought home enough food for another meal tomorrow night. Highly recommended, and be sure to check out some of the other shops along Livernois when you're in the area! Can't wait to be back!"
5/12/2018,1 star rating,I would strongly advise against going to Kuzzos! The service is absolutely the worst I have ever had. We waited for  15 minutes after we were seated for the waitress to come take our drink/food order and didn't get the drinks for 30 minutes. It took almost 1.5 hours to get our food.The food was good but not good enough to ever endure the service again. The restaurant was only half full and multiple tables seated long after our ours received there food before us. In short stay away!
5/12/2018,3 star rating,"Kuzzos is a great breakfast spot in the morning. The girls are so professional and food is consistent except when they have new cooks, which is very often. We have been frequenting at least once a week  since they open. Like I said without the wait staff the place would crumble.  Managers are changed on a monthly basis. They never visit the guests and ask ""how's your food and experience""? We did have a complaint during a late evening visit and we were horrified. The pop machine hoses weren't clean. The pop was served to us tasted like dirty dish water that left a nasty taste in our mouths.  The server (she was terrible) ignored our request for a manager as if we would be bothering him. After sitting there in an uncrowded restaurant and watching the manager avoid us, we kind had to make a scene for him to acknowledge us. After we gave him got gripes he just grabbed the glass and ran off. He clearly isn't built for managing. So the morning service is supurb! The evening service was subpar. Thus 3 stars."
5/11/2018,4 star rating,"It's not Roscoe's, however they do have some great offerings when it comes to the fried chicken and waffles.I went for lunch, street parked and walked in around 12pm.  I put my name down for 2 people, was told I'll be texted messaged when my table was open (i noticed when they entered my information, they put down 35 minutes for wait time).I pulled to the side and within 10 minutes (before getting text message that my table was ready), a gentleman walked up to me and seated us.  We reviewed the menu and with with the following items:- bam bam (2 drums and waffle)- dark & lovely (1 drum, 1 thighs and waffle)- Mac-n-cheese- Greens- Fried Green TomatoesFor drink, we got water.  This place is loud and it's hard to hear the waitress when they stop by to take the order.  After waiting 15+ minutes, our food started to come out.Fried Green Tomatoes - fried to perfection, however if you eat it by itself, then it's very bland.  Tasted like they did not season the tomatoes before being battered and fried.  I would highly recommend you dip it in the dipping sauce, as it'll take the flavor to the next level.  Mac-n-Cheese - skip it.  To be honest, the Mac-n-Cheese at KFC tastes better.  Not seasoned at all.Greens - get it, cooked for long time, seasoned very well!  I could eat this all day long!!Chicken - fried very well, juicy inside and delicious.  On my order, I got two small thighs, the first one was good, the 2nd one was over fried.  The drums are huge.  I also ordered the chicken gray, dipped the chicken in there, excellent!!The waffles were good, they ask you what you want in the waffles, I went with pecans.  Overall, not bad, prepare to wait.  I heard the wait time on the weekend can be an hour or longer.  The seating/waiting list needs some work.  As we were finishing, I got a text message that our table was ready.  Don't get me wrong, I was happy that we got seated within 10 minutes from putting our name down."
5/10/2018,2 star rating,"A group of friends and myself went to Kuzzos after hearing great things. We had horrible service, waited about an hour for our food to come out, only to get soggy waffles and a cup full of oil with some macaroni and cheese in it. Also, the minute they brought our food they started stacking the chairs and shutting the place down. Not impressed"
5/4/2018,5 star rating,"A generous portion of Chicken and Waffles that tasted so damn good. The waffles were top notch and their chicken was crispy and delicious. The marriage of sweet and salty dances across your taste buds. We arrived around 9:30AM and were able to get a seat right away. The service was pretty good, maybe a little on the slower side, but the food made up for it in spades. I would highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back."
4/30/2018,3 star rating,"Came in for dinner.  I have also been for breakfast in the past. Food was delicious, service is pretty hit or miss.  I don't remember having service issues when I have came in for breakfast. For dinner, I received my dish about 20-25 minutes after the other 3 at my table did.   It seemed like she was surprised she didn't have my food, and so she had to ask me what I ordered.   I love this place so much for the food and Kool-Aid it will be hard to see I won't be back, but probably not for a while. GET THE KOOL-AID!!"

4/27/2018,4 star rating,"WOW!! The chicken was just so perfectly fried. Golden & crunchy on the outside & tender & perfect on the inside! Went so well with the waffles! Didn't really enjoy their cornbread. Has a bit of a sour taste to it. Food took a while to get out, but was worth the wait. Because the chicken & waffle was amazing and it's the star of their restaurant! So we got what we came for!"
4/22/2018,1 star rating,"Walked in around 515 on Sunday, was told a 10-15min wait and they would text when ready, receptionist called at 532 saying she couldn't seat us because people weren't leaving. Wtf?! Definitely lost a customer for that!"
4/21/2018,4 star rating,"Back again...this time even better AND they have butter.  Made me happy. I'll be back. Previously....We tried the chicken and waffles. The prices are fair. The food good and served hot. Our service was good as well. My only problem is I was told they don't serve butter, and only have margarine. That was a big disappointment for me because I wanted grits, but didn't get any since I don't like margarine. Other than that, we enjoyed ourselves. We are going to go again and try something else on the menu. Maybe I'll take my own butter so I can try the grits next time."

5/17/2019,3 star rating,Let's begin with the fact they confuse chicken nuggets for chicken tenders. My chicken tenders were so small they must've been chick tenders. The waffles were pretty good. For two waffles I got one of those little plastic cups of syrup. They decided I just needed to sample it and the butter I guess. ‍ Dont expect to be able to call your order in cause it's not allowed! I was in a rush and had to order in restaurant which was a 15 minute wait. The bartender was tending and doing pick up orders. Then it took my food a little over 25 minutes to be prepared. So the food experience wasn't worth the wait. If you have nothing to do and just craving waffles I'd say go for it... and I mean NOTHING!
10/5/2016,2 star rating,"Belgian waffles are small and flat like they best the batter to death. They move very slow. It's overpriced. If you like to overpay and leave hungry then this is the place. Ghetto servers. The traditional bad service because blacks accept poor service and okay food due to lack of culture. You can buy a whole chicken and instant pancake mix with cinnamon that they use for less than the price of a three piece and ""Belgian"" waffle"
4/3/2019,4 star rating,We went for the first time yesterday this place is awesome the food is wonderful best greens and chicken you'll get in this town the girls that work there are very busy but they are very nice had a lovely time the atmosphere is wonderful the Kool-Aid is the bomb we are definitely going back ASAP I'll be taking my friends there awesome awesome food
7/30/2017,5 star rating,"Great food and friendly folks! The delicious salmon croquettes took me back to childhood when my grandmother would make them for breakfast. Not to mention, the lemonade Kool-aid in the big mason jar captured the essence of summer break in elementary school. The waffles are magical with a nice blend of cinnamon and hint of vanilla. HELPFUL HINT for out-of-town folks, be sure to pay to park on the street. We received a $45.00 ticket from the City of Detroit for parking just outside the restaurant. There were no signs visible and the parking kiosk was quite a distance from the restaurant. Needless to say, this was one of the most expensive breakfasts we've had in a while...still worth it though :-)"
9/29/2016,5 star rating,"Seriously the best chicken I've ever had. There was a 35 min wait but it goes by fast. I ordered the waffle with two chicken tenders and mac and cheese. Holy crap the chicken is the best!!! The mac was ok. The waffle was great too. I don't care for large Belgian style waffles this was more like ""eggo"" style. Thin crispy waffle. Can't wait to come back."
9/17/2016,2 star rating,"I had been looking forward to trying Kuzzo's for awhile....but food & service is weak. They have a lot of staff, though very little gets done for the customer. The place only had a few customers, but getting our water took 10 minutes and we had to ask another server to step in. I had the #7 ""Dark & Lovely"" leg and thigh with waffle. The fried chicken didn't come out hot! Really? I got fried chicken that had been sitting around like KFC.My wife did like her grits though....If I come back it'll be when the kitchen is busier."
4/6/2018,3 star rating,"The Good: Collard greens were on point. Eggs were cooked to order. Fries were good. Decor was popping. The Meh: The grits started off great, but had few big lumps of sandy-ass unmixed corn meal. Waffle as pretty good, but more floppy than crispy. Still: pretty good. The Bad: The customer service wasn't great. Surly host, waitress was just okay. Long wait times every step of the way. Very loud for 3:00 PM on a Friday."
6/11/2016,4 star rating,The wait is the only part that is bad.  Waffles were delicious and so was the chicken wings and the prices were so reasonable.  Love the kool aid as a classic throwback drink.  Full bar was unexpected but a welcome great after the long wait!
3/23/2017,4 star rating,"My friend and I have tried to come here twice before, but the wait is too long. Today I called ahead when we were five minutes away and was told there was no wait. When we get there, the hostess tells us it's up to a 20 minute wait. Okayyyy. We decided to stay because if I leave this time, I will not come back. I'm glad we stayed because we waited only about eight minutes. Besides how busy it is, the next drawback I notice is how close the tables are. I was seriously concerned about hitting several people with my handbag or a body part as I walked to the table. When I sat at the table, I had to sit at an angle because my chair was practically in the lap of the person at the table behind me. We both ordered the Trey-Deuce which is three pieces of fried chicken (breast, drumstick, and wing) and two waffles. The food arrived within a few minutes. The waffles were flavorful and fluffy, and the chicken was cooked perfectly but needed more flavor.  I had a mixture of the lemonade and red and blue kool-aids to drink. Wow. That's great, and they give a huge mason jar of it.  I had a whole waffle, two pieces of chicken, and a half glass of my drink left to take home. Will was our server, and he was great.  My overall experience here was positive, but I may not return because the dining area is too congested and wait times are hit or miss."
9/2/2018,1 star rating,Went to Kuzzo to dine-in and was told a hour wait. Waited my hour and than was told another 1.5 hour wait. Unacceptable and should not be tolerated. This is why you can't support all black business unprofessional and hosts are terrible!
9/5/2017,4 star rating,"Long wait times but the food is savory! I think the ambience is perfect for meeting up with old friends or associates. I'd suggest it for families, but again, the wait time could be too long for families wth small kids."
1/1/2017,3 star rating,"Since I live in Detroit, MI I've heard about this restaurant a lot. People saying it's the best and I should go try it.. so I did.On a Wednesday morning I decided to go to breakfast with my mother, aunt and sister. We came at 9:30am and the restaurant was already booming. We didn't have to wait and were seated immediately. I decided to order the Big Red (1 Red Velvet Waffle, 3 Wings and it came with a side so I got Mac n Cheese). Waitress took our orders and we didn't receive our food until about 45mins to an hour later. (I cut them slack since it was early and they were already busy BUT at the same time this place has been open for over a year now.. they should know to have all food options prepared before 9am.) In that time of wait, the waitress brought our drinks but never came to refill them until our order came out.My food comes out and it looks so good until I look over at the Mac n Cheese. I wish I would have taken a picture  I understand it's the morning and ""Who eats mac n cheese in the morning?"" But it's on the menu.. correct and the food should be FRESH. The mac n cheese was in a small white ceramic and inside was just oil. It looked as if they had scraped the remaining left overs from last night and put it into a container and served it the next morning. Like you couldn't have drained the oil? I decided to just eat what was on the top and not soaked in oil. I wanted to complain but you never know what goes on in the back kitchen.Aside from the HORRIBLE mac n cheese, the waffles were amazing. That cream cheese spread is superb and the chicken wings were huge. (Which is great!) To me, they lacked seasoning, it wasn't WOW, but the chicken was okay.My advice to Kuzzos: - Use your profits to invest and expand your restaurant. I felt so cluttered because there was another party seated right next to my party basically sharing the 2 tables.- Waitress training That red velvet waffle would be the only reason I come back to this establishment."
6/26/2016,4 star rating,"Easily one of my favorite places to grab breakfast or brunch! People complain about the wait, but the building space occupied by Kuzzo's isn't that large and it's usually more people trying to dine in than the facility can accommodate. Get there early and there should not be any issues with the wait. Each time that I go to Kuzzo's, the food never disappoints. The have some of the best chicken and waffles ever...and the Kool-Aid is so bomb!!"
12/8/2018,5 star rating,"Always have a lovely experience when eating here. The food is hot and delicious! The staff is friendly and always fun to chat with. Recommend getting their early if you don't want to wait. I've only had the chicken & waffles and grits. They are so good, unfortunately I never try anything else."
3/5/2019,1 star rating,"There was plastic in my chicken, I literally bit into a piece of plastic. I called back TWICE to tell them what happened and no one answered. Completely unacceptable and disgusting."
4/30/2016,4 star rating,"Great food. And amazing prices for what you get--nice portions and quality.I personally recommend the big red (red velvet waffle) or the tender love (waffle with chicken tenders). If the server offers you kool aid: say yes, you won't regret it.One downside: They don't take carryout orders over the phone."
3/27/2016,4 star rating,"I wish this restaurant all of the success, and am so proud of the owner for setting up shop in Northwest Detroit, where development and amenities are sorely needed and deeply appreciated! I was raised in Detroit (attended high school with the owner), but have lived in NYC since 2006, so this was my first time at Kuzzo's. What a delight! The service needs support--the housestaff need a LOT of training. We had several issues with our waitress, but ultimately, she was friendly and eager, and worked with us in good faith. The service is generally distracted and slow. On the other hand, the food is prepared fresh, and the fantastic R&B music keeps you entertained while you wait for your food. The food is fresh and delicious, and well-priced. Better service would guarantee Kuzzo's success. I hope to be back once I'm back in Detroit, and hope that Kuzzo's is doing better than ever then. Thanks for a fun and tasty dinner."
3/3/2019,2 star rating,First I would like to say this my 2nd time here and I Iove how our city is coming back. This place is great to improve the process. We arrived around 930 10 Sunday March 3 not to many people but can tell it's going to get busy fast. Worked on and got seated with 3 mins along with 2 other groups one was a couple and another was a single man. My husband an I was 2nd to get seated the older man alone was 1st then another couple we all waited 10mins before someone even said anything she walked up to the other couple and took their order and just looked at my husband and I and the older guy . Another 15mins went by and a girl said omg ugh sorry have you been helped.We all said no she said ok came back 5mins later took our order . We tried to order fish but no fish today we tried to order a Mimiso no champagne so we both got chicken and waffles 30mins later our order came and my chicken is RAW I wasn't going g to say another thing but decided how else will this business know where things are fallingApart. When the girl came over explained and she took the raw chicken in the back and remove it fromMy bill (never saw mange) I understand she said he was cooking but anyway got my bill and the momiso was still on the bill she was super nice and removed it. Just want to say I love what your doing in the city but please get it together love a concerned Detroit residence that want to. See you make it ! !
9/8/2018,1 star rating,No good rating from me. Terrible experience with the food. The actual service was delightful and pleasant but the food was horrible. They served me fried chicken with long strands of hair on it. The replacement chicken was cold and smaller than the first order. We still paid for one meal but mine was a disappointment.
11/29/2018,5 star rating,"nails-surprised to see they serve more then waffles and chicken. THE gteens corn bread. mac &cheese, and candied yams were delicious"
1/3/2019,4 star rating,Kuzzos was very busy but it was so worth the wait. One mimosa is $10 which is wild. I loved hearing D'Angelo alongside Shrimp n Grits.
2/23/2019,3 star rating,The waitresses have a hard time doing their job here. There is always a long wait even for just a cup of kool aid. Food is good though
2/22/2019,2 star rating,I ordered my food at 11:22 and didn't receive it till 2. I ordered thur a delivery service. The driver kept me updated along the way. I received my order all the legs in my order taste like it was cooked in old grease and it was undercooked. The waffles was soggy. The was my second time eating here and I can honestly say I was not impressed and very disappointed.
5/10/2017,5 star rating,"This review should have been completed a while ago. ..but I've been busy traveling, so here goes. :-)  I was brought to Kuzzo's as part of my birthday because I'm not from the area and I've heard only great things about it.  I ordered the wings with candied yams and rice and gravy (they were out of mac and cheese...booo), served with a cornbread muffin.  My love ordered chicken with the red velvet waffles.  The chicken was seasoned and cooked to perfection, not too hard or undercooked.  The waffles and everything else complemented in all the right ways.  I hope to return to this place when I am in Detroit again.  This place is fairly new still, but they are a true gem...perhaps even a new favorite."
10/22/2018,5 star rating,I recommend this place to everyone. I always go early so there's not usually a wait but I would be willing to for those delicious waffles and yummy chicken.
12/15/2018,2 star rating,"Similar to what other people have said. The food is really good, but the wait time to get seated and then to get ur food is ridiculous. It's a Saturday afternoon and the wait time to get the food after ordering is over an hour!! The whole process likely takes 2-3 hours. If you wanna spend a good portion of your day waiting, come to kuzzos"
8/27/2018,3 star rating,Ok so I will start by saying I was very satisfied with the food here. If i could base my reviews off of food only I would say it would have been very close to 5 stars but we had a few mishaps that forced me to give this place 3 stars. First there is no parking lot for this place which is something I am not a fan of because I had to park on a random street and I was in a city i was not familiar with so that was a negative. Second we put our name down and they said it would be a 30 min wait and they could send a text or call when our table was ready so we decided to go back to the car to wait. Well 40min goes by and no call or text so we go back in to see what happened and they claimed they contacted us but we never got It so we had to wait even longer. Finally apparently during our visit there was some type of issue in the kitchen which backed all of the orders up but no one told us we had to ask after waiting almost an hour for our food. We had other plans but we were unable to do them because we spent so much time at this restaurant. On top of that we were not compensated in any way for the inconvenience which I felt was poor service. The table next to us actually ended up leaving because they couldn't wait anymore. Also I asked for the chicken tenders but ended up with wings as you can see in the picture but at that point I had waited too long for my food so I refused to send it back but I was unhappy about that also. So maybe this was just a bad day because The food was great but the service was not.
9/30/2018,3 star rating,"Reviews are accurate. Don't go starving. The wait to be seated and get food had us there for over 2 hours. Food was pretty good, portion size was good. If they could get more efficient with the service they would get better ratings."
5/12/2018,1 star rating,"Terrible experience! The worst service I have ever had . We waited 15 minutes after being seated before anyone came to our table to take drink and food orders, waited 20 minutes for the drinks,including water, to come and then another hour and a half for the food to come out. The food was good but not worth the time it took. The restaurant was not busy with plenty of open tables so that wasn't the problem. The entire staff was nonexistent and not at all friendly."
9/27/2017,2 star rating,I arrived at 12 noon. It took 15 minutes to be seated. It was 4 in the party 3 were present. We could only be seated after the 4th person arrived. After being seated it took another 20 minutes for a server to come to the table. Then another 40 for the food. Coffee was not hot and servers were not cordial. The place was not even crowded.If given this place a chance 3 times. Im done...
1/27/2019,5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite breakfast places, the red velvet waffles are amazing and so are the wings. I definitely suggest getting the cool-aid too, they can mix the flavors and layer it like a fancy mixed drink. Both the food and service here are amazing and I will definitely be back."
12/30/2016,4 star rating,"On this trip to Kuzzos I ordered the Big Red ( 1 red velvet waffle,  wings,  and choice of 1 side.  I selected the cheese grits). The red velvet waffle is served with a cream cheese spread and it was wonderful!  The wings were fried perfectly!  Both were served hot and fresh to order. The cheese grits on the other hand were bland. I elected to skip the kool-aid  and I had OJ. I've been here on several occasions and each time the food was good. ( tip:  there is always a wait for a table).  However, the service has gotten better with each trip."
12/2/2018,3 star rating,Only went once it was pretty good but I wouldn't go out of my way for the food it was pretty mediocre
5/29/2018,5 star rating,"Yes yes yes yes yes! Not sure how I haven't heard about this place earlier because it is so good and is very popular in the area! The chicken and waffles were delicious and the portions very generous! Bring your appetite and wear loose pants lol! The sweet tea was perfect, the batter on the chicken was so good and it was melt in your mouth crispy. Waffles on point, egg cooked exactly how we wanted and the grits were creamy and well seasoned. Friendly service and a good atmosphere too. Check it out!"
9/17/2018,3 star rating,The waffles were soft and true southern style and the chicken was well seasoned but a little dry. I ordered a side of Mac and cheese and the cheese was separating from the pasta and was cold and bland.
11/27/2018,4 star rating,"Update: food is still the best but if they tell you they are doing a shift change in the kitchen, the wait for your food could be an hour or longer depending on how many are ahead of you."
6/29/2016,4 star rating,Not bad! Went around 4pm on a Tuesday. Service was good. Had the shrimp and grits with a side of wings. Chicken flavor was great on the wings and the grits were wonderful. Two other ladies with me owned a catering business so their critique was solid. One had the fried corn and it was decent as well as the Mac and cheese. Yams were not chopped small enough to cook them completely tender but flavor was good. Overall it is worth the visit and return.
1/12/2019,1 star rating,"Long waits, poor customer service. Me and my family waited about about 20 minutes for a seat. After that, waited another 20 minutes for anyone to come to the table to take our order. Never brought us any water, took 10 minutes to get the drinks we ordered. Once we got our food it was cold, we asked for our eggs to be remade and they put them in the microwave. Server was clueless when I asked her to take my meal off the bill because it was cold and not good. NEVER GOING BACK."
1/10/2019,2 star rating,"Went to Kuzzos Chicken & Waffles for lunch with three friends.  Chicken was excellent.  Waffles were different than I expected.  They were more like heavy doughy thin pancakes.  Not like what I expected.  Coffee was very weak.Service was extremely slow.  However staff was polite, friendly and promptly responded to my requests.  Wait for service and food was too long especially in an area with a two-hour maximum parking limit.  I got a $45 expired parking violation.  A very expensive lunch!"
10/1/2016,3 star rating,"So we came in on yesterday full of expectations based on the reviews. The chicken was excellent. Fried very well. I also order three sides. Collard greens, Mac and Cheese, and potatoes. The collard greens and potatoes was great. On the other hand the Mac and Cheese they should look into doing a better version of that.  Over great spot. I would come again."
7/6/2018,5 star rating,"I've never had better fried chicken in my life. That paired with a red velvet waffle, smothered in fresh butter and bourbon maple syrup might be one of the best and most satisfying meals I've ever had. The rice and gravy with some franks red hot added was amazing. My only regret is not ordering a kool ade. Next time for sure! You've got to get to this place. Seriously. Hot, sweet, savory and downright perfect."
1/3/2019,3 star rating,"Came here for lunch for two. We were seated with no wait, only to sit at our table watching our soon to be waitress walk pass us several times.Party of two came in and was seated next to us and was immediately greeted by a waitress. After asking the young waitress, who was our waitress. She alerted Dionne the other waitress that we were waiting. 3-4 minutes later Dionne came over. Service was dry with no conversation, no follow up on our meal quality, refill on drinks etc. The service was so dry, it became rude in its delivery.Food was good and quick. Kitchen was on point."
7/1/2019,5 star rating,"Kuzzos is, hands down, my favorite place in Detroit. It's not haute cuisine but the food will make you feel good and blow your mind, if you're open to what it's bringing to the table. The Chicken and Waffles are easily the best I've ever sampled, but every item on the menu is worth while. The candied yams and collared greens are particular favorites. More words need not be said, just do yourself a favor and go!"
8/19/2016,4 star rating,"I've been here twice before, the service is good but the wait time for the food is a bit extreme. Overall it's a good place to eat."
2/26/2016,4 star rating,"Took mom for her 75th birthday breakfast, and it was pretty crowded at 10:30 on a Friday. We didn't have to wait, but we got the last available table, so the servers were pretty busy, and it showed. They seemed to have plenty of staff on duty, but a lot of them didn't seem to be doing much. Our server was super-sweet, and very friendly and helpful. The layout of the dining room was VERY tightly packed, with no room for servers or clients to maneuver, which meant that we were constantly being jostled or having to scootch in or over, or getting a coat sleeve whacking us in the head. They definitely need to rearrange the tables, big time.Food was pretty good - not as good as we had hoped; we were both really wishing it would be like true Southern food like we were used to when we lived in Georgia, and this did not measure up, but was still pretty good, by Yankee standards, I suppose. Service overall was pretty good, food was not awesome, but not bad. We left full, that's for sure. The restroom was really dirty, though, Had obviously not been cleaned or mopped in days, which for one-seat room in such a high-volume joint, is just, well, gross."
11/6/2017,3 star rating,"Kuzzo's Kuzzo's Kuzzo's... damnit why haven't you improved your service yet? The food is great. Amazing even! But not at a 2-1/2 hour expense. Really? You tell us 1 hour and its an hour and a half later? Atleast offer something off of my bill, a free coffee across the street, a piece of pinapple, something.. nothing after waiting for eons to get two seats? Smh.. I tend to be a very understanding patron, and not even during peak lunch or dinner times, but in general. ESPECIALLY for places in high eating demand like Kuzzo's. With an optimistic attitude and semi hungry cravings we entered Kuzzo's on a Friday afternoon at 1pm. There was a large charter bus parked on the street in the front and upon entering we saw 25-30 ""tourists"" wrapping up their bills (or so we thought) with styrofoam to go boxes in hand. We were told an hour wait (but really.. after the group leave only 20 or so people would be in here).. we said ok and the hostess took my cell number to text us when our table was ready. Well.. two hours later (and after I spent money at the boutique next door) we moseyed back into Kuzzo's and was told only 10 minutes. We waited inside.. looking at a semi empty bar and two tables available.. 30 minutes later we walked out after hearing an altercation spill out into the dining room from the kitchen. Hard pass-- New Center Eatery is our go to Chicken and Waffles place now.. sorry Kuzzo's but get your ""***"" together!"
7/20/2017,5 star rating,The food was delicious. The fried chicken and yams were perfect!! The restaurant is designed very nicely . It's well kept and very clean. Our waitress was very nice and polite. I will definitely bring out of town guests here so they can say nice things about Detroit.

7/15/2016,5 star rating,"The atmosphere and customer service reminds me of the south, in other words it was outstanding. Our waitress Simone was very pleasant and outgoing, she treated us as if she knew us. The seating area was spacious and we had plenty of room to eat. The best thing about Kuzzos is the fried chicken, I ordered the trey duece and it was three pieces of chicken and two waffles. The chicken was nice and crispy with lots of down home flavor. The chicken breast was not so big that you would mistake it for a turkey breast. The waffles had s hint of cinnamon and were quite delightful. If you travel to or are in Detroit make this spot one of your stops I promise you you will not be disappointed."
9/22/2018,2 star rating,"The food was ok. I got the ""what up doe"". It came with two waffles similar to waffle house, grits, 3 pcs of chicken, and eggs all for $15. Chicken was somewhat bland and larger pcs are dry. The eggs were cooked well and so were grits. I also had the spiked tea which was potent! The worst part was the wait of 50 mins for our food. Even though it came out hot it was not an out of body experience for the wait or the price we paid. It's not too bad it's just when put next to the cons it lowers the value."
10/16/2016,2 star rating,"I previously had a 5-star review but after coming back to Kuzzo's several times now as it is my neighborhood nice place to grab a bite, I've decided to edit my review.Kuzzo's is cute, clean, and a fantastic business idea. It's a simple menu... fried chicken and waffles.... but somehow the menu is two sided and has a LOT of options for what kind of chicken and waffle you want. This might be part of the problem.... I don't think you need 35 different ways to combine these items... focus on 4 or 5 and make them spectacular. It seems they have so many combinations that is comes as a detriment to their service.Over the years of coming back to this place now I've come to realize that the overall customer service is very slow and often not great. Fried chicken and a wafflehouse style flat waffle don't take long to cook... how is it possible that a 15 table restaurant cant keep up with the orders and it takes an hour or more on a regular basis to get your food? It seems that the big problem here is around management of the restaurant... they need to run a tighter ship and figure out how to optimize the kitchen for a menu. Drinks are expensive, but great! I love the koolaid cocktails, but feel like they maybe are a little pricey, however i do appreciate that they use top shelf local liquor so I don't want to complain too much. The sweet tea is absolutely too sweet with no actual tea flavor. I have attempted to ask for a 1/2 and 1/2 sweet tea, or 1/4 sweet tea and regular tea and every time i am CONVINCED that the server forgot and just gave me the sweet tea... it tastes like watered down maple syrup. I get that some people are really into this, but man, how anyone can drink straight sugar water in a giant glass like this is beyond my understanding, and I enjoy a good sweet iced tea. Overall I just expect more from this place given the price and overall great look and feel. Service and speed need to be priority and i think it may take simplifying the menu to make it happen. Also, with so much obesity in the world, it'd be great to see them back of on the vast quanities of sugar on their menu.... Red Velvet Cake Waffles with cream cheese icing, whipped cream, powdered sugar, and fruit syrup and deep fried chicken thighs? That's diabetes on a plate."
3/9/2016,4 star rating,"Go early on the weekend or try them on a weekday. We went on Saturday around 11 and waited an hour to be seated. The place is small but don't let this deter you. This place is a ""Must Try""! The food was seriously good. The Koolaid was seriously bomb. The only reason why not 5 stars is because our server was a little off. She did complain of her late night the day before and that she has a lot of kids at home and I empathize, especially having a 2 year old at home. But, when I go to work, you don't know my woo's. Anyway, they need more pleasant and professional servers which from other reviews I know they have. I guess I got the short end of the stick there. But everything was satisfying, just needed a smile with my meal. What are you waiting for, GO TO KUZZOS!!!!"
2/24/2018,3 star rating,"I absolutely loved the concept of this place. He food is quite good too, but the wait is absolutely unbearable. 3-4 years into your business you should not still have poor kitchen timing and an understaffed floor. They have put in place a new que system where they text you when your table is up. That is nice because their are other shops on the block to explore while you wait, however you have to have the patience of Job or a die hard Lions fan to even stick around long enough to be fed. We checked in for our table of 2 at 2:06pm. We were told it would be a 30-40min wait. We went to the neighboring coffee shop, Men's suit store and even stopped in the grocery store up the street. 50mins had passed when we went in to check our status and their were still 5 tables ahead of us. About 20mins later we were seated, 5mins later a waitress came and asked us for drink orders. We weren't going to let her get away so we gave her drink and meal orders. *Of note, our young waitress was very polite and professional* This order taming happened at approximately 3:20. It was 4:11pm before we saw her again. She had most of our food in hand, but we had eaten all of our silverware by then to avoid starvation (kidding...Not the times, those are completely accurate). Anyway, great concept but don't come hungry. Just don't do it. Or you will leave angry. They absolutely can and should do better."
3/19/2015,5 star rating,"I came initially during their opening week. At once I knew this place had potential. The design of the restaurant was cozy and still chic. The wall art was edgy and the colors were vibrant, while the wall description of the origin of the name ""Kuzzo"" drummed up feelings of warmth and home. Now, there were negatives on that first visit. They were not prepared for the massive response they had. We waited a long time to be seated and a disproportionately long time to get our food. Kitchen timing was a bit off because some of our items were cold on arrival. I did not write my review right away because I could see how hard the staff was trying and I understood they were new.I am happy to report that all errors have been corrected now in my second visit. All the same good points are here including the kind, hardworking staff and the food was timely and piping hot. I highly recommend Kuzzos when you visit the ave of fashion."
12/18/2018,3 star rating,Yawl can't even open on time . Their hours say they open at 8. I definitely waited until 8:30 and the door never opened . I could see employees on the inside. I'm guessing they were short staffed
12/12/2018,1 star rating,"Very disappointed with this place. I woke up early to eat at the restaurant because of the good reviews. At 9 am, we tried opening the door, but it was locked. I called them, standing right in front of the restaurant and they said they wouldn't open until 10 because there was an emergency AS PEOPLE WERE EATING INSIDE. It may have been a family event or something, but they should have at least left a note in front of the store saying why they closed for two hours. Bad customer service."
9/17/2016,3 star rating,"Amaaaaaazing waffles and while some complain that the consistency is more pancake like, I love pancakes and I love cinnamon ; particularly buttermilk cinnamon flavored anything so a buttermilk cinnamon flavored waffle could never be wrong on my eyes! The chicken is crispy on the outside and tender and juicy in the inside! The perfect pairing to a waffle!The soul food sides and customer service is why I give this place 3 stars. Ghetto , ignorant and rude waitstaff who thinks the business is some high school popularity competition and less than tasty sides are the negative. Apparently others agree that the sides (Mac and cheese, greens etc) ate off putting because every time I go I notice people order them and barely touch it. A few times I even saw them sent back. Stick to what it says on the outside of the building; Chicken and waffles !"
4/30/2018,3 star rating,"Came in for dinner.  I have also been for breakfast in the past. Food was delicious, service is pretty hit or miss.  I don't remember having service issues when I have came in for breakfast. For dinner, I received my dish about 20-25 minutes after the other 3 at my table did.   It seemed like she was surprised she didn't have my food, and so she had to ask me what I ordered.   I love this place so much for the food and Kool-Aid it will be hard to see I won't be back, but probably not for a while. GET THE KOOL-AID!!"
8/10/2016,5 star rating,So my experience at Kuzzo's Chicken and Waffels was a great one. Let's start with the drink grape Kool-aid with Lemonade was awesome. I had the Trey-Duce meal which was 2 waffles and 3 pieces of chicken. My husband had 1 waffle and bacon. Our server Brittney was absolutely amazing. If you like eclectic atmosphere try this place in our neighborhood on Livernois. The next time I'm going to try the Shrimp and Grits.
9/26/2015,1 star rating,"I'll start by saying I don't mind waiting for spectacular food...that aside, I do mind waiting for mediocre food and sub par service. I went to Kuzzo's for my first time expecting amazing food from what I've heard. My wait was only 30 mins on a Saturday so that's not bad at all, however while I was sitting down I saw many empty seats and many people waiting outside.Our waitress was nice but very slow! I never got my water refilled the whole time I was there. The wait for the food was long, but we did get the big red (red velvet waffle and chicken). The chicken was perfectly seasoned, crispy and juicy! That's where my accolades end. The waffle, the star, was very dry and didn't have much flavor. I was warned to get the cream cheese sauce on the side and I'm glad I did, it was very thick and way too sweet. The eggs weren't special, in fact I prefer the eggs I make at home to these. The music was very loud and I spent my time yelling at my friends. I usually don't let one bad experience stop me from giving a restaurant another chance, but there wasn't much here that made me feel like a second chance would make a difference. Once was enough."
6/3/2017,5 star rating,"I'm no stranger to Kuzzos. They had me at the door with their amazing service and inviting atmosphere. Their red velvet waffles are beyond amazing and the cream cheese is the icing on the cake, or shall I say the icing on the waffle. The chicken tenders pair so well with the waffle. The batter is seasoned to perfection and the chicken is so juicy and flavorful that you will want to order more. I usually get water with lemon, but on the days I feel like treating myself, their multilayered look-aid is the bomb! If you are looking for great service, awesome people, in a great atmosphere, then Kuzzos is definitely the place for you!"
7/2/2019,1 star rating,"They probably have the worst customer service in the city. The waitress never brought us anything to drink even after asking twice( not even water). On top of that, she had to the nerve to attempt to charge us for the drinks that we never got. I had to go to the store next door to get a bottled water so I wouldn't die of thirst. Also, the service was extra slow at best and then we were served extra fried dry chicken. I will spend my money elsewhere. The waffles were good however- but not worth the poor service. The waitress never even attempted to apologize for the poor service."
10/6/2018,5 star rating,So good!!! I had the Bam Bam and my husband had the Dark and Lovely. Waffles were perfect and the skin on the chicken was amazing!!! 14/10 would eat again!
10/4/2018,2 star rating,"Used to be enamored with Kuzzos. Slow/inattentive service, inconsistent chicken quality, and frequent order errors have soured my opinion. Sad to say they've converted me to New Center Eatery"
12/17/2015,3 star rating,"Pros: Great service. Everyone was friendly and we went on a Saturday morning so it was bumpin', and all of the servers and hostesses were working hard and had a smile the whole time.Location. I don't often get over to this side of town, and I've gotta say, the Avenue of Fashion is looking great! I try to patron black-owned businesses as often as possible, which is seemingly less and less a possibility in mid-town and downtown, so I think I will be making my way over here more often.Art. I really dug all of the original art hanging on the wall. The place in general had a great ambiance.Cons:Food. Waffles were pretty good. Chicken was pretty good too, but very disproportionate in size. What I mean is, both my partner and I ordered a breast and mine was huge and his was tiny. I mean, it legit did not look like a breast. When he asked our food runner if it was a breast, she assured him it was and didn't seem to notice the extreme difference in size. Obvi, we don't want weird franken-chicken, I just feel like this was obviously a weird piece? I ordered a side of greens and I was less than impressed. I'd go get the greens from DVS any day, or make my own tbh. Eggs were meh as well. Maybe we went on an off day, or perhaps just our orders were a little off. I am not opposed to give them another shot, I think the was enough ""good"" that happened to warrant a second visit. I live closer to New Center Eatery, so I guess when my chicken and waffles cravings kick in, I'll go there."

1/3/2016,2 star rating,"The food is typically good but service sucks. We waited 45 minutes to be seated.  It took 11 minutes to be greeted by our server Jazmine, and that was after having to stop other servers ""excuse me can you please get the server for this table?"" It took 18 minutes to receive our drinks.  Meanwhile, Tia  (other server) had taken the orders of 3 other tables that had come  in long after us. Now, we will see how long it takes to receive actual food.  I will follow up..."
6/17/2016,5 star rating,"Since recently graduating from grad school I've taken a few small trips to random cities.  Once I arrived in Detroit, someone recommended that I hit up Kuzzos so I did.  The food was amazing.  I ordered the 'First Lady' which consisted of a chicken breast and a waffle.  The chicken was cooked to order, moist, tender, and bursting with flavor.  I've never visited an establishment that nailed everything the way it should be.  Also, service was SUPERB.  On my next visit I'm going to tip the waiter/waitress $100. Thanks"
7/28/2015,5 star rating,"I loved my meal here.Got in on a late Friday morning to a packed place, but waited only about 5 minutes with my friend for a spot at the bar. The bartender was super friendly and helpful. Not a huge fan of their $10+ cocktails, and refusal to mix things other than their listed cocktails, but I just wanted a big mug of coffee anyway (From Great Lakes - it was excellent!)the What Up Doe that I ordered came with two gigantic waffles, three pieces of superbly crispy and flavorful chicken, cheesy grits, and two eggs. The waffles were soft and fit with the rest of the meal perfectly, highlighting the contrast of crispy chicken and creamy grits. I only ate a third of what I ordered- the rest was a great second meal later.My only mistake was not putting the eggs on top of everything else! In my long history of eating breakfasts, I have found that a runny egg on top of everything else is never a bad thing- ask my friends Biscuits and Gravy.I was very interested in the rest of their menu, including a ton of soul food, and would love to stop in for dinner some time."

8/20/2016,2 star rating,"Overall review: service was super slow; food was so-so. There was a 35 minute wait to be seated. Server was nice, but it took three requests/reminders for her to bring the fried green tomatoes that I ordered as an appetizer. As a result, they came out with my entree. I had the salmon croquettes, added a chicken breast so I could say I tried what they're known for and had two sides, mac and cheese and collard greens. Fried green tomatoes were bland, even with the remoulade sauce. Mac and cheese was far from aunties recipe. It was basically boiled noodles with a little butter and some cheese. Collard greens were pretty good. Fried chicken was a little too fried/dried out. Salmon croquettes were delicious."
7/11/2018,4 star rating,"Loved the waffle and chicken was so good, the syrup was very tasty.  I don't usually eat pancakes or waffles at restaurants because of the syrup but this was delicious.  Lumpy grits, in my mothers that would go to the trash.  Service was fine except iced tea automatically came with lemon on lip of cup and when I asked for a new cup because I hate lemon tea,  I could taste lemon in the tea.  I guess it was too much to pour a new cup.   I give 4 stars because of the syrup/"

7/29/2015,5 star rating,"Best chicken and waffles I've ever had! Ever since Beans and Cornbread, I've been trying to find some good chicken and waffles. I tried this for the first time and I will never go anywhere else for chicken and waffles. The drinks were great too. If you're not drinking alcohol, you HAVE to get the kool-aid. I recommend blue with lemonade. My girlfriend got the red velvet waffle and it was fantastic. The cheese grits were perfect too. I have no complaints. The owner and waitstaff were very nice, and checked up on a regular, but not annoying, basis. I love this place."
5/19/2019,3 star rating,"I went to Kuzzos for brunch today for the first time. It's a popular restaurant so there were a lot of people when I arrived. There was about a 20 minute wait for the table. Once seated the waitress seemed nice. I ordered a mimosa and waited. A couple sits across from me 15-20 minutes after I am seated and they get their mimosa before me. My waitress was no where to be found. I went to the host to report what I observed. Her response is ""I'm not a waitress but I can find your waitress."" I clearly knew that she wasn't a waitress. All she had to do was apologize for the delay and say she would find my waitress. AFTER AN HOUR, I finally get my food. (The waitress did warn us that it would be a wait.) The skin of my chicken was seasoned to perfection. The meat of the chicken was tough. The yams, mac and cheese, and greens were pretty good and my mimosa was decent too. I don't see myself running back to Kuzzos but I may go if invited by a friend."
6/29/2016,5 star rating,Went on a Sunday after church. The 45 min wait was worth it. The food was amazing. I had the veggie plate which allowed me to select 3 items from of my choosing from the menu. I also got a blueberry lemonade kool-aid severed in an insanely large mason jar. I'm not a kool-aid drinker but this was good. I couldn't finish it and was offered a to-go cup. I wouldn't even had thought they had a to-go cup that large. I can't wait to go back
5/20/2016,1 star rating,"TRIED IT AGAIN!!!! Won't be back. Terrible service . TERRIBLE OMG. And the food was undercooked. Catfish undercooked, chicken undercooked, all waffles undercooked. I mean are they trying to get people sick. Not trying it again. I left a comment a few months ago and I'll never come back. The waitresses are so .....I can't find the word but it's not good."

And that was to bring us our water 25 minutes after we ordered it. She never took our order, other waitresses took our order and checked on us. When they brung our food, the girl dropped the syrup all over the table. The waffle was soft as hell. Why didn't it have a crisp? The food was so Mediocre. It wasn't something to rat and rave about. Did I mention how terrible the service was? My fiancé ordered eggs with his meal and he got his eggs when he was literally DONE with his food. I'll never come back. It's just so much I don't feel like writing !!"

I'm not usually in the market for chicken and waffles but my cousin wanted to try this place so I went. I was pleasantly surprised that they offered so many different combinations!  Whatever piece of the chicken you prefer, you can get (drums, wings, breast, whatever). I ordered the tenders (Tender Love). It was great!  The seasoning on the chicken was perfect. The waffles had a great flavor as well (nutmeg?). I can't wait to go back."

5/31/2015,1 star rating,"I would never come back to this establishment. My husband and I decided to try a new restaurant after church so of course it was a Sunday. I assumed it would have great food since it's always busy. Boy, was I wrong!!!! We waited at least an hour for a table. Now I don't mind to wait for good food. Then we were seated in the front by all the other people that were waiting for a table near the bar. It was truly uncomfortable. I accepted the table because I was REALLY hungry. It wasn't large enough to fit 2 regular sized plates!! But beggars can't be choosy I guess.I ordered lemonade which I was told was freshly squeezed but when I tasted it I could clearly tell it had country time lemonade in it. I hate country Time lemonade. So why would u tell me it was freshly squeezed? I ended up with Kool aide which was the ONLY positive part of my meal. I ordered the chicken and waffles which I thought it was their specialty. I was SO wrong. My waffles were soggy and taste worst than off brand store bought frozen waffles!!!! I only got 2 chicken wings which had no seasoning and were not even warm. It all was kind of gross if you really think about it. And to make matters worst my meal was $14. The only positive aspect to my visit was my waitress. She was great and patiently listened to all of my complaints!  I wish them the best of luck but I'll NEVER be back. Here's another detroit restaurant that will be closed in a couple of years if they don't get their stuff together!!"
12/16/2017,2 star rating,Great food! I ordered the Red Velvet waffle with cream cheese icing and 3 wings. (All very good) Well that lack of stars goes to what I was told would be a 25 minute wait for 2 was more like an hour wait. My server Asha was very sweet and busy but seemed spread thin as we didn't see her a bunch. This spot is cute and seems unorganized from the seating back to the long wait time for food. I would support in the future maybe I just won't come for brunch.

12/1/2017,2 star rating,"Just recently just tried this place for the first time and I wasn't impressed. The chicken was seasoned well, but it the biggest pieces of chicken I've seen. I thought it was turkey pieces. That just meant that their chicken is full of hormones! Then the waffles was made with cinnamon. I wasn't expecting cinnamon waffles considering that wasn't advertised as cinnamon waffles. I have food allergies so that could have been disastrously. My cheese grits were good though considering they mix the cheese in. I will come back, but I will pass on the chicken and waffles."
5/12/2018,1 star rating,Absolutely a terrible experience! I would advise to stay away from this restaurant. We waited for over 20 minutes after we were seated before our waitress showed up to take our drink orders and another 20 for the drinks to show up and by drinks I mean water. After 1.5 hours our food finally came. The restaurant was not very busy and the entire staff seemed to be nonexistent. The food was ok but definitely not worth two hours.

6/5/2016,4 star rating,Chicken and waffles is one of my favorite dishes and this place dose it very well! The only issue I found was the wait time was a little long. However it was a great friendly atmosphere. Very cleanly. And the food was outstanding! Their chicken was moist and flavorful and the waffle was absolutely delicious with the waffle butter on top . The sweet tea was a little too sweet for my liking but I know some people like it that way so no complaints. We will definitely be back.
5/16/2015,4 star rating,"I heard mixed feelings about this new spot which is located on the famous Avenue of Fashion located on Livernois between 8 & 7 Mile. From ""The food is good but wait time is long"" to other various praises and complaints. Fortunately my experience was positive. Soon as I walked in I was pleasantly greeted and seated. Once seated I was asked for drinks and time to review the menu. Once I decided what I wanted I preceded to order my meal, chicken and waffles. My meal was brought out I'd say 10-15 mins later. The chicken is seasoned perfectly, not too little and not too heavy. The waffles were very good, not just the plain ol instant stuff. I have no special palette but I could tell there was vanilla and cinnamon in it. All in all my wait time was good and the food was good. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who has or haven't tried chicken and waffles. Oh yeah and this places food is way better than Roscoes out in L.A."
7/18/2015,4 star rating,"I am not a connoisseur of soul food, but who doesn't like fried chicken and sides? I like the place. The fried chicken and the grits are REALLY good.  Crispy seasoned chicken...mmm...The waffle was also delicious, with a hint of vanilla. It wasn't Belgian, but I didn't mind it one bit. The potato hash/casserole was a little too salty for  me, and I don't do sweet tea or Kool-Aid, but if you do you'll be happy. They have a creative menu and a lot of ways to mix and match white meat, dark meat, as well as catfish, shrimp and greens.The only other chicken and waffles places I have been to are Beans and Cornbread and New Center Eatery. This neighborhood is doing neat things, with hip and interesting stores along this strip of Avenue of Fashion and feels completely safe. I'd come again to see what's going on.Staff was great, asking if we were enjoying the food multiple times, and my group of 4 was seated in 15 min. Our trick? We went early on a Sunday morning, after first morning of church goers, but before late morning/Noon service got out."

2/17/2019,1 star rating,"I love this place. The art is cool. The food is phenomenal. The drinks are choice. It's just a matter of getting these things that's the problem. Being busy can be a good problem for any business, but not if that busyness is caused by carelessness and oblivious inefficiencies as is the case over at Kuzzo's. After waiting 45 minutes for a table (quoted 30), and more than 30 minutes for coffee (actually one coffee came after 15 minutes, but alas mine was forgotten somewhere in the madness of a Sunday morning rush), and 40 minute mimosas, we abandoned our order either not yet started or sitting somewhere near a heating lamp. Not sure if our waitress knew we left, but at 20 minute intervals we figured they wouldn't miss us. Kuzzo's needs to reevaluate their management and serving strategy or it seems they've grown too quickly too fast. This should be a staple on the Avenue of Fashion, it could even stand to expand at some point because the food is truly that good. But I can make good food at home, and for now I highly recommend avoiding Kuzzo's on the weekends or any time they might have more than 4 tables to attend at once. Unless you have a few hours to kill, maybe bring watch a movie on your phone, or if you get a thrill out of airport delays, Secretary of State waits, or maybe bring your own coffee? At any rate, one star until this place can figure out how to run a brunch restaurant on a Sunday morning."
10/15/2017,5 star rating,I was visiting Detroit for a friend's wedding. A friend took me here for breakfast. It was absolutely delicious!!!! They made me a coffee with Baileys....yummmm! I forget the exact name of the dish that I ordered but the fried chicken and the waffle was finger licking good lol. We sat at the breakfast bar so there was no wait. The food came pretty quick and the service was great. I'd definitely go back!
3/18/2015,1 star rating,Just left kuzzo's ! Disgusted with the wait time. An hour& 20 minutes for 2piece fried chicken & egg white omelet!!!! WHERE DO THEY DO THAT AT?!?!And it's my birthday.. Never coming bak again -Smh!
6/25/2015,5 star rating,Good Food with great service I go for Shuntia if you're at the bar and Yonni if your in the restaurant section. The waffles are great but they are thin (I love that) and the cinnamon in them make you feel like you're on a cloud.
11/2/2017,5 star rating,"Never disappointed, food is always delicious. If going on the weekend expect a line. They also have kool-aid options that are cool as well. Prepare to leave full"
5/28/2018,5 star rating,"Soooo good. I got a simple chicken breast & waffle with sweet tea, and it was AMAZING. All parts. Dope. Give it an award. Spend your money here. Go."
8/5/2016,5 star rating,"First time eating here. Treated myself to birthday brunch at the bar. When I walked in, at 1:30 on a Thursday, the place was almost completely packed. I came alone though so I sat at the bar. My boyfriend, though, has actually tried to dine here 3 times now & has yet to be able to do so b/c of the tremendous wait times. However, the food was amazing! & fast! The menu said my choice of The Big Red (red velvet waffle, 3 chicken strips or wings plus 1 side) took 10 mins to make but it didn't even feel like it took that much. Great first time for me!! I'll definitely be attempting the waiting times to get another taste of this."
10/30/2015,3 star rating,"Damn. I really wanted to like this place. The service was really really slow and the food was only okay. I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy plus two scrambled eggs - no cheese. My friend ordered the Lala with a side of chicken breast. My eggs were wrong and my friend's were too salty. I asked for them to remake mine but by the time they came out, I had finished the rest of my meal so it wouldn't be cold. Our waitress was very nice, but still slow to refill water and see how the food was. She said the manager was coming out but they never did so we left after paying the bill that was cut in half. Overall not terrible, but disappointing."
2/14/2018,5 star rating,"There are a few places in the Motor City that I bring my friends to when they visit. Kuzzo's is a must visit. It's a hip, clean environment with delicious food and drinks. It's in a fun neighborhood near 7 Mile and Livernois, so you can shop after you fill your belly with fried chicken, waffles, and other southern comfort fare. Chicken and waffles is a trend that has kind of died out over the last few years, but Kuzzo's will remind you why it works together so well. The chicken is ahhh-mazing. Don't forget to wash it all down with a big jar of Kool-Aid!"
3/11/2018,5 star rating,"Great place to stop for some homemade southern style eats! Restaurant was easy to find and we were quickly seated.  Great menu options; and I can't say enough great things about their homemade biscuits. Chicken and waffles were great, with the chicken tenders being my recommendation. They offer red velvet version of the dish, but I would recommend the traditional waffle for less of a sugar rush and more flavorful dish. They are one of the few places around to offer legitimate southern sweet tea along with some amazing kool-aide concoctions. Wonderful place! Stop in and be ready to eat!"
7/1/2018,5 star rating,"Whenever I'm in Detroit, I'm going to Kuzzo's. Yes, you're going to have to wait for your food. However, I promise you it's worth it! I'm hopeful that one day the owner will add a second location or move to a larger space so it won't be so cramped."
7/26/2015,4 star rating,I loved it the Waffles are to die for.  I got the what up doe and it was great alot of food and you will not leave hungry I will promise you that.  Don't get a Breast if you are not hungry really. Sad they are close on Mondays. The music is a little of the new and old school.  So be ready to enjoy yourself.  The wait was long but Everything else Perfecto!!
3/5/2015,4 star rating,"So, I have been to Kuzzo's  twice. I wanted to get a good feel of the restaurant before writing a review . My husband has been 4 times. Twice with me, and twice with his brother. Here is the real. The Food - The food is excellent. I have had the Sweet Potato waffle , the Red Velvet Waffle and Kuzzo's own secret family recipe waffle. All were Delicious. My favorite being the Sweet Potato waffle. The portion is good for the Sweet Potato & Red Velvet waffle , as they are made Belgian style. The chicken is excellent . Fried to perfection , not too salty , and not to bland. It serves for the perfect balance against the waffle for a perfect sweet and savory combo. I have also had their collard greens, and I loved them. They were cooked  leafy green and perfectly tender , while having just the right amount of taste where nothing was needed , such as salt or vinegar.  According to my husband, who I must add, is IMPOSSIBLE to please, their Catfish is perfection. Which is why he has been more than me. Kuzzo's HAS THE FOOD RIGHT. They have to , because , where they fall flat ..Is Service. I will say, the times we have been the staff is pleasant. Very nice all of them. They are attentive and kind. But they are not what I would call a professional wait staff. I would surmise that these are family , friends and individuals who live in the area . And that is great , that  Kuzzo's is bringing jobs  to the community. But having said that..Here are some issues that I have seen.. My first visit, my Hubby and I were seated, had ordered , and waited. During that time. 4 other tables were seated at least 30 minutes AFTER us..Three of those tables got their food BEFORE us..and the Fourth table, they waited an HOUR before they were told that the kitchen didn't have what they wanted. It was the waitresses job to address that issue with the manager . They should have recompense that couple for making them wait a whole hour before even telling them that the kitchen was unable to fulfill their order. My husband also went and the same thing happened to two women who were sitting and eating at the bar area. One woman got her food, and the woman with her left, because they didn't even bring her food. THIS IS BAD KUZZO'S ... You need a PROFESSIONAL WAIT STAFF.  Not just a Nice and pleasant one.  They need to understand how to push the kitchen , and the Kitchen obviously has an issue with organization and flow. I am hoping that someone on your staff sees this review... because  YOUR FOOD IS DELICIOUS! You have the FOOD DOWN. You must work out the kinks and problems in how you kitchen runs and your wait staff needs to understand that it is THEIR JOB to address the problems they have when food doesn't come out in the order of seating.. And when customers are not getting their food AT ALL!  Please fix these issues, cause I want you to succeed. Making money and having the business is great..But  TOP NOTCH SERVICE MATTERS!  People can only give you the ""It's a new place""  excuse for the first  3 months...After that... It is just not trying . Please Fix you kitchen and  Train your wait staff.  FOOD IS GREAT THOUGH! I will be back . Hope things get better."
4/6/2015,4 star rating,"Nice place. Unique decor. Cozy seating. Parking can be a challenge. Very popular, expect a wait. Food is great.Visited on a Saturday afternoon as a party of three. Wait time was estimated at 30mins but ended up being closer to an hour. Luckily there were nice shops nearby to pass the time.Once seated the service and food completely took the focus away from the wait! Everything was as expected & the rush had no effect on the friendly service. The food was fresh and cooked perfectly. Only complaint would be the lack of seating for waiting customers. (*during peak times) & underestimated wait time given by the hostess."
2/1/2015,1 star rating,The decor looks great!  The concept is great......but you can't make customers wait an hour & half from the time they order to get their food!The food came out cold!  Customers everywhere very upset......I hope the owner can fix the lack of management issues cause if he does he will have a successful business!!!!!!
4/11/2015,2 star rating,Kuzzo does not live up the hype. I think there's a lot buzz because it's owned by a Detroit-native NFL player Ron Bartell and in a neighborhood that is not being heavily invested in compared to midtown or downtown. Take both of those things away and its mediocre at best.Arrived at 8:15am. There was no wait and my party was immediately seated. Ordered the Big Red. Food took 30 min. Mac and cheese was hot and good. red velvet waffle was cold. Chicken tenders were good temperature but had no seasoning. the chicken tenders taste processed. I've had better chicken tenders at fast food joints. Not better than IHOP or OHOP which was disappointing. I really want this place to win. If I ever go back I wont get waffles or chicken.
2/10/2015,4 star rating,"YYYAAAAAAASSSSSSS........In the words of this little girl on Instagram who did a video review of Kuzzos: ""This food is DELICIOUS.....I'm tearing it up!!"" I was super excited to try Kuzzos after seeing all of the publicity about the new Chicken n Waffle spot that hit the D.Upon arrival, I was very impressed with the decor:  stylish, artsy, and yet downhome.  We were greeted by two hostesses who seemed somewhat happy to see new customers arrive.  Our waitress was not much better in terms of friendliness--she had a slight attitude and was very unfamiliar with the menu...the spot is still new, so I gave a her little break.The  FOOD: Amazing fried chicken, perfect flavor, crispness, and moist! yum!  The waffle was superb as well---man this combo is so good.  I actually ordered a combo that came with eggs, grits, chicken, potatoes, and a added waffle for $2.50.  I had an awesomely sweet arnold palmer too.  My bill was like $11--NO LIE.  The somewhat lack-luster service was tolerated due to the heavenly food.  I'll be back...really hope they are here for the long haul ."
2/7/2015,5 star rating,"Usually when you come to here and look up a chicken and waffles place, you'll find a few reviews comparing it to Roscoe's. I'll do that by saying this place is every bit as good. Good enough to go there two days in a row and bring my girlfriend the second time. The Sweet Daddy (sweet potato waffle) and the Big Papa (steak, eggs, and a waffle) are both phenomenal. As far as sides go, I'd say the mac and cheese and collard greens were very good.The service is a little slow and inexperienced, but they'll catch on. The cooks will figure the slow food time out soon too. This place is brand new and it's already thriving. Give them some time and they'll be the best chicken and waffles place in the Midwest."
8/10/2018,1 star rating,Horrible serve!!!!!! Wait staff unfriendly in visiting from dallas food was cold chicken was hard do not waste your time with this place I am from detroit and i know there are other venues in the city where you will get better service and food talked to manager he seemed unmoved by our conversation concerning his restaurant again don't waste your time here!!!!! if i  could have given no stars i would have
2/10/2018,3 star rating,"The positive- The fried chicken was very good, the grits were creamy and flavorful, the waffle batter was tasty, the waitress was pleasant. The negative- The wife found a 5 inch black wig hair strand in her salad, the salmon croquettes were full of oil and too salty, and the waffles could have been cooked a little longer. The cooks probably should wear hair nets or better weaves or wigs."

2/9/2019,1 star rating,"Just walked out after waiting 20 minutes to order food then another hour to try and wait for food. Couldn't wait anymore! There was no explanation, apologies anything. Saw no food coming out for anyone. Our server was the manager as well and when we said we couldn't wait any longer she didn't say anything to keep us there.  This has happened before which makes me not want to ever come back or recommend this place."
7/29/2018,5 star rating,"I  believe I ordered a red velvet waffle, wings, and fries. Delicious. I usually don't like jumbo chicken wings, but these were perfectly cooked to the bone. Nice clean, cozy setting. Great customer service."
9/2/2015,3 star rating,Wait Time - Hour and A Half  Nothing Really Wrong About It But It's Still an hour and a half wait Food- I order the red velvet waffle chicken combo the waffle was a bit on the cold side ... My original side the home style potatoes the waitress informed me  were going to be like Bob Evans which I found out we're not more like a potato stuffing kinda thing Customer Service- Great Charde was very attentive and kind Overall - the Chicken / Mac N Cheese and our waitress is what saved this meal
3/28/2018,1 star rating,Waited and waited while other people where seated. Over 5 parties where attended while I waited for over 45 minutes Horrible place and treated very different cause of my race is what I feel.
2/11/2016,4 star rating,"My food experience has been good, I like the ambiance, the staff could always be more polished, and yea the wait times, but If there's a wait time, then they must be doing well. I love how Google will show you they're peek hours, I may try to go when it's not so busy. But I like that this beautiful place exists in the city and that every time I go, it's always bursting at the seams. The people are an eclectic bunch and it's always a fresh experience whenever I go. The rest of Livernois should take a hint ( which I do feel it's in the rebuilding process) and will one day look like a Ferndale or other surrounding areas. But, I like Kuzzo's, they follow my Instagram and take not to the wonderful pics I take while I'm there. Oh yea, I pay attention to details, the menu is professional And the names of the menu selections are comical"
3/25/2018,1 star rating,"Do not come here on the weekends if you're actually hungry. We waited almost an hour and a half to be seated...hostesses had no idea what was going on. If you didnt actually ask about your table, you were forgotten about. Service was also terrible. Took us an hour to get our food. Everything I needed, I had to ask for 3 times (including a glass of water which took 20 mins). Food was not worth it. The catfish and chicken was good...waffle was nothing special. Had to put salt and pepper on everything else (eggs, grits, etc). The only upside was the busboy who was very attentive and cleared the tables very fast. I was very disappointed otherwise and will not be returning."
12/6/2015,4 star rating,My bf and I ordered the Tender Love chicken tenders and waffles with a side of Mac n cheese and an order of biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were amazing! The chicken n waffles were pretty good but my bf said he has had better. The Mac was clearly not fresh but had decent flavor. If it was fresh it would probably have been really good!
6/15/2015,3 star rating,"I went with a friend in March.  With everything I'd heard about how crowded the place usually is (and it was) I was surprised when we were seated at the bar in under 20 minutes.  Though there was a pretty long wait for our food, our sever (Tee Tee) was very attentive and did a good job of updating us on the status of our food every few minutes, so I wasn't too annoyed by the wait!  I ordered the ""Tweety Bird"" 2 wings and a waffle.  The waffle was decent with a cinnamony taste that made it interesting, but the chicken, the chicken was the STAR!!! And the Kool-Aid in the mason jar is A-1! The only reason I can't say the waffle was the best is because I prefer Belgian waffles, so I'll most likely order the Red velvet waffle the next time I go, as it is Belgian.  Would go here more often if it were closer to me."
1/31/2018,4 star rating,Wow wow wow wow Tyler favorite spot after some spliffs. He was right tho food good and priced so cheap for flavor you get . If you haven't had kool aid in awhile in your luck cause they have plenty on tap
12/2/2015,4 star rating,"Yum Yum Yum....Is the only way to describe this place!  I had heard from many about the great food here and I was not disappointed!   If you are in the mood for soul food at a sit down restaurant, this is the place.  I've been wanting to try for awhile, but the place is always jammed packed.  It's very small in there, coupled with the great food...I can see why. I went on a Tuesday evening and no wait!  Service was good and menu well priced.  The best Kool-Aid I've ever had....and it should have been at $3 per glass and no free refills.  The only thing I wish that could be improved is the parking.   Other than that...would definitely be back again!"
5/24/2017,4 star rating,"Foods is good. Service needs to be improved. Took 20 mins before someone came over, greeted us, and gave us water, truly unacceptable. This is located in an affluent area and the patrons expectations are high the food delivers please just speed up a bit"

5/5/2017,4 star rating,"You are probably going to wait for a table, but its worth it. Red Velvet waffle is to die for. The chicken is always on point and fried to perfection. The regular waffle leaves a lil to be desired but its still pretty good."
12/10/2016,2 star rating,The service was a 3....The kitchen reheated some Mac n cheese in a ceramic bowl....This leaving the bowl hot and the food still cold.  Also ordering any thing other than a jar of water...... yup you guessed it you gotta wait and wait and wait for a beverage. Took about 15mins for one drink and a beer. ...... so the wings still worth the wait for carry out...Not for sitting.
6/17/2020,1 star rating,Sooooooooo I woke up today me and my wife before work decided we wanted some good fresh urban breakfast ( mind you she's never tried their food but I have once it was great ) BUT NEVER ORDER CARRYOUT because clearly they don't care.. we went in to put a order they said 20 minutes which we said okay cool we could run a little errand and we did we came back food still wasn't ready so I waited at this time it's 3:55 and I put in my order at 3:04 on the dot! Finally at 4 we get our food we check it and they messed up my eggs for one first mistake .. second mistake when they told us it was no more catfish in the building but we could get chicken tenders and we agree THIRD MISTAKE we got in our car tasted the chicken picked up a waffle it tasted like IT HAD BEEN SITTING FOR THE WHOLE ENTIRE HOUR OR LONGER ! we go back in because at that point we don't even want it because it's been and hour gotta be at work we asked them for a refund the manager legit tried to tell us that they don't give refunds and it's stated on the sign on the inside when in all actuality ITS NOT and while I was I inside at first another customer was dissatisfied and she received a refund with NO ISSUES mind you we spending 40$ for food and waiting an hour!!!!! The damn manager tried to argue with us about how there is nothing they can do blah blah my thing is that why argue why not say okay I can give you a partial refund and hope you come back for a better experience but no myself and my wife are both cooks we would never sell anyone the food that they are selling in any other condition other than better than great! Overall it was just unacceptable and I'm not about to argue with nobody about the money I'm spending on food that I'm recommending!!! OH ALSO WE HAD THE AUDACITY TO SAY ME PERSONALLY ID NEVER ORDER A CARRYOUT WAFFLE LIKE WTF DO YOU MEANNNNNN LADY!!!! It's not supposed to be soggy and nobody it supposed to wait an hour for a sitting ass waffle the fuck!

3/31/2015,5 star rating,"I have had my fair share of chicken and waffles around the globe.  This is the FIRST time the duo was EXTRA-ORDINARY.  I ordered the Bam Bam, 2 perfectly seasoned fried chicken legs, and the magical waffle.  The waffle was fricken amazing...nothing you've tried before.  It was nothing short of perfection.  The bright blue kool aid in the giant Mason jar compliment the fun family friendly enviroment.  The service was great as well.  Detroit needed this, keep up the good work."
2/4/2015,5 star rating,"Tremendously warm and welcoming staff and even better food.  This place is off to a great start, packed already on a Wednesday afternoon.  The food was warm, comforting, and delicious.  Well worth the effort to seek this place out."
2/23/2015,5 star rating,"Awesome chicken.... Awesome waffles. The sweat potato waffle is actually spectacular. One of the best I ever had. The staff was especially warm and attentive. I will be attending again. This is a wonderful add to the new avenue of Fashion. The decor is very modern and sophisticated yet casual  not intimidating. The extended hours will be a great addition to the area, adding another sit down dinner option. This place is awesome because it provides access to a nice sit down modern restaurant (that you might typically find downtown or in midtown) to the people on the westside of the city."
7/9/2015,5 star rating,"This place is wonderful! From the menu names to the service and the food. There was no wait because we came in the morning. Shout out to Tia for being a great server. Together, we ordered the Big Red (Red Velvet waffle, chicken wings, and grits), the Shrimp and Grits, and the Aunt Mary's (Salmon patties, cheese eggs, and cheese grits). Every item down to the last grit was flavorful and good. The coffee (from Great Lakes coffee) was fresh, and the Red Kool-aid was sweet. I definitely recommend this spot in the morning or afternoon, and ask for Tia."
7/9/2016,5 star rating,"I heard about this place from a friend and continue to come back ever since then. The food is great from the chicken and waffles to the fried catfish and grits!!The only minor complaint I have is when calling in to place an order. The phone doesn't get answered at times and you to need to walk in to place the carry out order.However, the service while dining in is great, friendly, and fast. It just calling to place an carry out is only minor thing that requires a little bit of work.Overall, great place with great food and I'm long time satisfied customer! :)"
11/2/2015,5 star rating,"I've gone here multiple times and each time has been great. The fried chicken is awesome and I love their maple syrup despite not usually liking maple syrup. Their waffles are thin and you can add pecans to them for an additional dollar. I get the bam bam for $6 and it's enough to satisfy my hunger (portion sizes are pretty big here). Only cons I can think of: parking is hard to find, service can be quite slow sometimes, and the mac and cheese was just alright. Despite this, Kuzzos remains one of my favorite Detroit restaurants!"
3/20/2018,3 star rating,Pretty good.  Popular.  Good luck getting seated during peak times.  Slow turnover of tables due to casual diners and slow service/kitchen.
5/31/2015,5 star rating,I love it!!! The food is amazing and the ambience exceeds my expectations for a chicken and waffle restaurant. I have to admit I'm going on my third time dining here! I've introduced two people to this business. The wait time is expected but it's  not long before you have your meal. The wings are pretty good and not dry. I'm impressed.
7/3/2016,2 star rating,"Brought my daughter here for her birthday sad to said I will not go there again. Wait time was over an hour. One hostess tried to seat a couple ahead of people who arrived before that couple but got busted. Ordered: chicken, waffles, grits, eggs and lemonade. The chicken leg was too chewy though the wing was tender haven't eaten the breast yet, the flavor was lacking. The waffles were cold and under cooked. The grits were tasty, the eggs tasted as though they were mixed with the powered type of egg(a little pasty tasting) and the lemonade was made from concentrate which I try to stay away from from."
3/13/2016,4 star rating,"Food was delicious, but the wait time and service left a LOT to be desired. It's easy to get a table if you are a couple, but if you have more than two people in your party you will wait a long time! Waited about an hour to get seated for a table of four, then our table was squished against the window so I literally had my back against the window all night long. Took our waiter about 20 minutes to come over and then tell us he would be right with us, then another 20 minutes to take our order, and an additional 15 minutes to get drinks. I actually felt bad for him bc he seemed to have so many tables to work with, there were not navy servers there in a Saturday night. That seems to be poor preparation for a restaurant that is consistently crowded. The food was awesome! Chicken, collard greens, grits and the WAFFLE!!! So delicious and very well priced. The kool-aid is great but SUPER SWEET so make sure to order water as well. I wish our server would have come back to check on us just once so I could have gotten some water.All in all, great food but the layout/service need a lot of work. We had a great time with friends so it made the wait time not as big a deal but there were a LOT of frustrated folks around us."
7/28/2017,4 star rating,"I was very satisfied with my meal selection of Chicken and Waffles. I've traveled all over the country and this place is in my top 5 places to order Chicken and Waffles. Every bite provided another comforting flavor. I couldn't stop eating it. I also tasted the salmon croquettes. I didn't particularly care for that dish. It may have been the onions. Overall, it was a great experience and I would go back."
8/15/2015,4 star rating,"Would definitely go back. Had the chicken wings and a waffle. The chicken was cooked well and the waffle was just right, a little sweet.

3/4/2018,3 star rating,Good soul food but we waited entirely too long for our food. Not sure if they were short staffed or what. We were sat at our 4:00pm and didn't get our food until 5:05. Lots of customers were complaining about the wait time.
6/9/2018,2 star rating,"Not sure I can give Kuzzo's anymore of my business.  I really wanted this to become my neighborhood spot, but service is poor on service and food levels. For this visit (May 26): I waited approx. 25 min, before I was seated at my table (party of one).During my wait, I asked twice for waitress to address my wobbly table. Eventually a busboy comes over and places a couple of napkins (a paper napkin??!) under one of the table legs. He then stood up and told me to ""be real careful.""  When I demonstrated this really didn't fix the issue and asked if he could come back with a towel or something more substantial, he mumbled under his breath and slid away...it has now been 35 minutes since that interaction and neither he nor my food have yet to arrive.I'm at least hopeful that my food will be worth the wait...Fast forward another 15 minutes. My waitress comes back and asks if table was fixed. I told her it wasn't and she proceeded to confront the busboy and chew him out. She then offered to move me to another table, which I accepted.Food comes out a few minutes later and while the fish was excellent, the piece of fried chicken was way over salted.  To the point where I could only eat 2 bites because the salt started to irritate the inside of my gumline.The last two times I came here, I was treated to food (chicken) that was tough and overcooked.  My friends informed me that I should expect that when I arrive 30 minutes before closing. Most likely they simply gave me food that wasn't fresh, merely warmed up. I can't say that I am impressed at all. I expect my food to be prepared fresh no matter what time it is...if you seat a customer, then you prepare their food freshly cooked, right?  Right!In any event, this is the end of my experiment.  Since I moved here from Los Angeles, I really wanted this establishment to replace Roscoe's for me.  But that's a no-go.  I will prepare my own chicken and waffles from here on out.  On a positive note, my waitress was very sweet and friendly; she just didn't have much support by means of organization or team work."

Mix the red koolaid with lemonade and you're sure fall in a sugar coma. The food was pretty good, the portions are huge so I recommend ordering a platter or two and sharing it among friends and family."
1/22/2017,5 star rating,"Great, speedy service! Delicious food!! I was apprehensive at first because their waffles look like Waffle House waffles(gross), but they were so much better. The chicken tenders were also delicious. The kool-aid was also to die for! I'll be dreaming about my next visit!!"
1/22/2017,4 star rating,"This place is nice. The food is amazing! I've been here 4 times and they always are consistent with it.  The service have been mediocre at best every time I come. Overall, it's a really nice atmosphere and the people are nice.I think that the service is not so good because the kitchen is always backed up."
1/15/2017,5 star rating,"Such great food! The waffles have such a perfect flavor, and the biscuits & gravy are the best I've ever had. Yes, there was about a 30 minute wait, but it's worth it for the great food & service. I suggest coming earlier to avoid a wait."
1/12/2017,2 star rating,"My boyfriend heard so much about this place so he texted me while at work asking me to bring him some. I asked him to call in his order and I would pick it up. Unfortunately he was told that they didn't except call-in orders because people don't pick up their orders. I walked into what seemed to be a nice cozy atmosphere. I attempted to order two orders of 3 wings and two waffles. The lady bar tender responded "" we have many different combos of wings and waffles do you mean the Trey Deuce""?  I'm respond OK I guess its called the ""Trey Deuce"" give me that. I sat for 25 mins waiting while the female bartender was talking to a male customer. He was telling her about his family. She then asked does your wife allow you to talk to women? Then she proceeded to pour a drink. He asked who it was for and the bartender said you I'm trying to get you ""turned up"". I felt that the conversation was totally inappropriate to be having with a married man especially when you have other customers are there.When I finally received my order I opened my box as always to check my meals and the chicken was cold. I told the lady at the bar that it was cold and she responded "" well I was waiting on your waffles!"" I couldn't understand because I thought this was a chicken and waffle place so they should have the timing down to a science. When I finally received my new order she brought it dropped it in front of me and walked away. She acted as if I was a problem even though I had said nothing besides my chicken is cold and I would like fresh chicken. I  thought that was only right since I paid $28 for two meals. I really wanted this to be a wonderful experience but I was very disappointed. Kuzzos lost me as a customer as well as my mate. They also lost many more potential customers as I have coworkers and a host of family and friends in the surrounding area. Word of mouth can make you or break you. Food:Chicken was fried hard like I enjoy it and seasoned really well.Waffles were soggy and inedible and over spiced with cinnamon.Advice: Please focus on customer service that is the only way to maintain success. Ladies keep it professional you can be sexy without trying to come on to someone else's spouse and you never know who is listening."
1/7/2017,5 star rating,"Kuzzo's hands down has the best chicken & waffles in the City of Detroit. The restaurant is cozy and the waitstaff is extremely polite. I ordered the Tender Love chicken strips and waffle with sweet tea and mac & cheese on the side and everything was done to perfection. The chicken strips were crispy and the chicken was extra tender (the name won't lie to you)! I brought a friend and she had the What up Doe - she brought home enough food for another meal tomorrow night. Highly recommended, and be sure to check out some of the other shops along Livernois when you're in the area! Can't wait to be back!"
1/1/2017,3 star rating,"Since I live in Detroit, MI I've heard about this restaurant a lot. People saying it's the best and I should go try it.. so I did.On a Wednesday morning I decided to go to breakfast with my mother, aunt and sister. We came at 9:30am and the restaurant was already booming. We didn't have to wait and were seated immediately. I decided to order the Big Red (1 Red Velvet Waffle, 3 Wings and it came with a side so I got Mac n Cheese). Waitress took our orders and we didn't receive our food until about 45mins to an hour later. (I cut them slack since it was early and they were already busy BUT at the same time this place has been open for over a year now.. they should know to have all food options prepared before 9am.) In that time of wait, the waitress brought our drinks but never came to refill them until our order came out.My food comes out and it looks so good until I look over at the Mac n Cheese. I wish I would have taken a picture  I understand it's the morning and ""Who eats mac n cheese in the morning?"" But it's on the menu.. correct and the food should be FRESH. The mac n cheese was in a small white ceramic and inside was just oil. It looked as if they had scraped the remaining left overs from last night and put it into a container and served it the next morning. Like you couldn't have drained the oil? I decided to just eat what was on the top and not soaked in oil. I wanted to complain but you never know what goes on in the back kitchen.Aside from the HORRIBLE mac n cheese, the waffles were amazing. That cream cheese spread is superb and the chicken wings were huge. (Which is great!) To me, they lacked seasoning, it wasn't WOW, but the chicken was okay.My advice to Kuzzos: - Use your profits to invest and expand your restaurant. I felt so cluttered because there was another party seated right next to my party basically sharing the 2 tables.- Waitress training That red velvet waffle would be the only reason I come back to this establishment."
12/30/2016,4 star rating,"On this trip to Kuzzos I ordered the Big Red ( 1 red velvet waffle,  wings,  and choice of 1 side.  I selected the cheese grits). The red velvet waffle is served with a cream cheese spread and it was wonderful!  The wings were fried perfectly!  Both were served hot and fresh to order. The cheese grits on the other hand were bland. I elected to skip the kool-aid  and I had OJ. I've been here on several occasions and each time the food was good. ( tip:  there is always a wait for a table).  However, the service has gotten better with each trip."
12/26/2016,5 star rating,"My partner and I traveled an hour or so just to visit this establishment. There was a bit of a wait, but it was well worth it. The food was great, the drinks were strong (we both had the Long Island). The vibe was also right. I'd recommend this place."
12/22/2016,4 star rating,Very nice restaurant small but classy. The food was very good but long wait time I would say it's worth the wait. It's beautiful to have a place like this in Detroit not the suburbs.
12/14/2016,5 star rating,Best chicken and waffles  went there for lunch with my son. Great service and don't leave without trying the Kool aid
2/17/2019,2 star rating,"Ughhh!!! Got there at 4:45 p.m. to dine in, didn't get our food until after the restaurant closed at 6:00 p.m.! We sat alone in the restaurant while people swept and moved tables/chairs. Food was botched...never got my eggs, salmon croquettes were overcooked, wife never got her grits, over hard eggs weren't cooked all the way through, etc. Had to wait 20 mins for water and drinks that we ordered, had to ask for silverware - table beside us laughed because they said they'd been there an hour (no food) and had the same issues. Manager offered a 10% discount, which I don't even think covered the cost of one of the two missing side dishes! Food is average AT BEST, service is lacking!"
6/21/2017,5 star rating,"Get the 'What Up Doe"" and don't look back. Huge amount of delicious comfort food. The fried chicken was the best I've had in Michigan. I'll be back for more. The red velvet waffle is also delicious."
5/17/2019,5 star rating,"The food is AMAZING! I go anytime I visit the city or surrounding area. On my last visit I barely made it in because the hours were incorrect on the website. I had spoken with Janeen over the phone when trying to place an order. She said I have to come in and place it so when I walked and and was told by the bartender it would be too late, I advised her of what I was just told by phone. Not only did they make my food but Janeen and the bartender were extremely friendly and the best company while I waited for my food to be prepared. Never disappointed and shoutout to the staff for being so accommodating."
3/14/2017,2 star rating,"One of the most irritating things I find is when a small business, cannot accommodate the demand of the patrons. We went there knowing that there are no reservations to be taken, fine. But, what we didn't know was that some of the customers had been waiting so long, they were actually cursing. There was no manager to calm them down, so everyone else had to be subjected to it. I don't understand why businesses where people want food don't stay on top of this. Just hire a host or hostess to walk around to the tables, see how their service is, maybe bring them a small bread basket or something, calm them down, and thank them for their patronage. Instead all saw were waitresses running around like crazy-scrambling to get things done. The food is OK, not really for me. I like more healthier alternatives, but if you want something hearty for a good price -this is the place for you. Again, just keep in mind it's going to take a while to get your food and by that time you may be too angry to eat."
6/20/2015,3 star rating,"So this is a great spot to go when you want something familiar with a little twist. The decor is modern and minimal but the tables are tightly packed and the bar is limited. You won't be disappointed with the chicken and waffles especially the red velvet, no syrup necessary!  There is a drink menu, however limited the concoctions are delightful.  I only gave three stars because i was so disappointed in how some of my favorite sides left me wanting...while the serving size was generous the mac n cheese had the oddest taste and even worse after taste... my yams,  the next day had a thick layer of waxy residue that kinda disgusted me.  But, the greens are really, really good, no... really, really good!!!The staff has a lot of kinks to work out that more experience would solve and you definitely need to revisit your choice of bartender like one that knows more about alcohol and at least capable of opening a wine bottle. Nonetheless, I will be supporting this businesses because Livernois needs more retail variety particular good food venues and quality shopping and less braiding salons, liquor stores with cafeterias and bootleg merchandise or miscellaneous shops that sell goods that have no really customer base in this particular neighborhood."
3/15/2019,1 star rating,"SERVICE IS HORRIBLE horrible horrible!  Waited 45 mins before drink order.  2 hours in and no food order.  When I asked waitress about the delay, she cussed me outY. STAY AWAY!"
8/6/2017,5 star rating,"I love this place, reminds me of a cool spot in Brooklyn. Good atmosphere, but more importantly, good food. I spent many years in LA eating Roscoe's, and Kuzzos comes the closest to doing it right. Happy it's right round the corner. :-) Decent wait time, great service too"
12/21/2017,2 star rating,"First time here and I was ready for some good food and service during brunch. The food was great and I'm being super serious. The bartender Angie was great as well. The lack of stars are for the length of time my party waited for food. Our door took about 45 minutes and that is usually not a problem if the kitchen is just naturally running behind, but the 4 parties that came in after mine received their food before us. How Sway? The bartender went to request the presence of the General Manager and he never came. We finished our entire meal and sat around waiting and he was a no show. The bartender went back to the back to speak with him and he offered us $3 off or 2 free drinks. We were already behind schedule so we took the $3 discount.  So much for only paying $1 to park since we were there nearly 2 hours."
4/6/2018,1 star rating,"Waited two hours for a table and STILL couldn't get service. Left in disgust. While we were waiting SEVERAL (like ten) groups came in, ate, and left while we were waiting.  We felt like it was a personal issue. Will never go back."
4/1/2015,2 star rating,"Truthfully this experience was one star worthy but it was my third time coming and the other two werent nearly as bad. We arived st 8:30..ordered around 8:45 and the food wasnt out until 9:50. There were two of us and we were told 3 times ""your food is coming"". Now maybe just maybe if the food was on point id let it slide but it wasnt. I ordered a meal that came with three sides...i got 2. Asked the waitress for another side...never came. Asked the manager why i was charged extra for a breast and only got a wing (he said he would get me more chicken) never saw him again.So we wait forever then because the waitress says she will fix the bill. After wasting time we left money and walked out. Im all for supporting a business but at the end of the day ITS A BUSINESS!!!!! I pay you in full i expect the service to be handled in full. First time ive ever left a restaurant still hungry and angry enough to not just never come back but also leave a negative review. Bottom line...communicate upfront if the kitchen is slow, at least handle drinks (she didnt get us one single refill)  or better yet dont expect me to pay full price for you not doing your job."
4/21/2015,3 star rating,"Just ate a Kuzzos for the first time. Have to say they have some kinks to work out. First off if your name has chicken and waffles in it, then you should excel at making both. Chicken was good. The waffle needs help. Doesn't look very appealing but flavor is not bad. I think the waffle needs to be looked at again. The sides we had were very good. (Mac and cheese and home style potatoes with cheese). Although the potatoes seemed to be French fries that were being cross utilized. I ordered a drink that took a pretty long time to come out. I had to remind them that I ordered one. It was a very poor attempt at bourbon and sweet tea. Some simple syrup would have made all the difference. I understand the family concept behind the place, but the staff is a little to unprofessional for me. The place has a great location a good concept, but it needs to be elevated in a big way."
7/23/2017,4 star rating,"Great food great customer service only issue was the wait. When I got there a party of 5 would have to wait 1.5 hours I think that is excessive but the technology they use to ""put you on the list"" is satisfactory they will text you when a table becomes available for your party. This allowed us to shop down livernois ave as we salivated over that we would be eating at Kuzzos Chicken & Waffles"
9/25/2017,3 star rating,"Being a fan of chicken and waffles, I was excited to find Kuzzos. Located on Detroit's ""Avenue of Fashion"", it is a neighborhood favorite that always seems busy and buzzing.The waffles themselves are nice (thin and floppy, not fat and crispy, so adjust your expectations accordingly), with a cinnamon flavor that fits together with the chicken and maple syrup in a very pleasing way. The chicken is moist and well-spiced (actually the seasoning is a bit ""spicy"" for my palate, but I'm an Irish girl, so even plain black pepper is generally too spicy for me). For anyone who has turned a questioning eye to the concept of chicken and waffles, this is a great place to pop their proverbial cherry.What keeps me coming back is the biscuits and gravy. They are legit the best I have ever had. The biscuits are huge and the sausage gravy is perfect, perfect, perfect. Slap a little berry jam on top (don't knock it til you've tried it) and you have culinary perfection.Great food, great atmosphere. A must-try."
11/30/2017,4 star rating,Having eaten at Roscoe's in LA I would say this is just as good.  The waffles are nice and light and the chicken is true Southern flavor.  I truly enjoyed my brunch at Kuzzo's.
11/27/2017,5 star rating,"Waffles are amazing!!! Freshly made and delicious. The chicken was so tender and tasty! Great service.. our Server was so attentive and fast. and the wait time was long, but definitely worth the wait!!!! They also have Kool-aid drinks! How fun!"
9/16/2015,4 star rating,Had the chicken breast and waffle with mac-n-cheese. The chicken was great and the mac was home made just how i like it. Crispy but not too crispy. Got the first lady special with a lemonade. Yum
7/1/2018,1 star rating,"This place was highly talked about. We came today with some friends who regularly dine here and our experience was horrible. We were just a party of 4 we waited over an hr for our food (this was not during a peak time of the day either) We noticed others who were seated after us received their food prior. We were told by our waiter that there were only 2 cooks in the kitchen and they were ""lazy"". At this point that is not what I wanted to hear especially when others who shouldn't have, received their food before us. When we were given our food it was hot and the manager came to tell us they were out of syrup . We thought it was a joke since  we all had waffles. It wasn't a joke but he told us someone ran to get some so in like 10 mins we would have syrup waffles would be cold by then). One of my wings was not cooked throughly, it was all bad and the best the manger could do was knock 15% off ($5). After all of that that I lost my appetite and just was disappointed in the lack of customer service. We have to get to the airport! I hope someone from this establishment reads this and takes the proper steps to make sure this doesn't happen again to someone else."
11/17/2017,5 star rating,"Hadn't been in over a year and decided to bring a few coworkers who had never been. We had a decent wait ( 20 minutes) but the hostess kept us well informed.  Our food was amazing! We all got different menu items but each was equally good (we shared). Loved the mac and cheese and the chicken was perfectly seasoned. Also the waffles are so good.  Although everyone eats belgian waffles now, I'm sure that if many of think back to our childhoods, our waffles were thin like this. They have a great batter. I love that this is a sit down restaurant in my old neighborhood with such diverse patrons!"
6/2/2017,5 star rating,"Believe the hype.  Chicken tastes like my late Grandma Mary made it, straight up.  Music was so severely on point.  Windows were open to the most perfect Livernois breeze on a 70-something degree Sunday afternoon.  It could not have been a better experience.  Staff is courteous and the wait was short (perfect timing, in sure:)."
11/7/2015,4 star rating,"Going back and forth between 3 & 4 stars. Couldn't place a carryout order over the phone so I came in to place it. You're sent to wait in the bathroom hallway and eventually a server takes your order. .....if you're lucky. It's very unorganized and the service was terribly slow - 3 people who placed orders long after me got their food first and another women came in to pick up her call in order which frustrated me because I was told I couldn't call one in.However, the food was delicious.  My friend had the big red with chicken tenders and mac & cheese. She loved it all. I went with hazel's southern platter with catfish, a wing, greens, yams and cornbread, all of which were delicious.  I was also impressed by the size and quality of the piece of catfish and the chicken wing. I only wish the shrimp and grits came blackened or spicy."
3/31/2015,5 star rating,"I almost don't want to review Kuzzos because I don't want more people to come and make my wait for delicious chicken and waffles longer. However, I should be fair and so begrudgingly I highly recommend that everyone gives this place a try. The seasoning on the chicken was amazing. I think I may have blacked out while shoveling food into my face. When I came to, I had syrup in my hair and bits of chicken on my shirt.I had the red velvet waffle, 3 chicken wings and biscuits. The waffle and chicken were so good that I really didn't mind that the biscuit was less memorable. In fact, I think the only reason I wasn't as impressed with the biscuit is that I got full from the chicken and waffles very quickly and also forgot to order my favorite biscuit condiment, honey.Don't miss trying this place, it's worth any wait."
3/21/2015,3 star rating,"When I heard this place was opening, I knew I had to  check it out since I'm a certified brunch junky. The place was packed when I arrived, but we were seated after a relatively short wait. Both my friend and I ordered the chicken tenders and red velvet waffle with Mac & cheese and greens. I also ordered the sweet tea. Now, I'm a certified sweet fanatic. My sweet tooth is well-known throughout the community and I've been known to drink a whole sweet tea from Mickey Ds and still want more. I tell you this to let you know that I can handle my sweets, but the sweet tea at this joint...It tasted like it was from concentrate with only a dash of water. Can you say diabetic coma? The greens and Mac were just okay. The chicken was pretty good, but the star of the show was the waffle. It was the perfect texture, not too dense and not too light. The flavors were balanced and the edges just crispy enough. I want to go back to go back to try more of the breakfast items. I'll just stay away from the sweet tea."
4/6/2019,1 star rating,I decided to try my neighborhood spot again and I'm so disappointed..... the host just told me everything is shut down.... it's 1:50pm.... on a Saturday.... no one came to great me when I sat down for a good 10+ min..... my waitress has asked me on 3 different occasions what I ordered as far as my drink and food?!?!? I'm just praying she actually put my food in.... I never even got a water.... idk what's going on here but it's a complete mess..... I'm willing to try it again when they can fix service..... note to self don't come here on the weekends
8/11/2017,1 star rating,"Very sad that we weren't thrilled by this place as we want to support local restaurants. Our first experience was bad on all fronts. We sat at the bar and weren't greeted for over five minutes. Our meals were brought out 5 minutes between each other. When My husband's burger was brought out, the burger was over cooked and his fries were missing; then were delivered an additional 5 minutes later and were undercooked and soaked with grease. I was super excited to find shrimp and grits on the menu. Looked beautiful but was totally tasteless. Perhaps we would have had more success with chicken or waffle menu items."
10/17/2016,5 star rating,"Came here for the first time and had a really good experience. The greeter at door was pleasant and patient. We arrived before the rest of our party, so we were seated once the whole party arrived. The  kool aid, is super sweet and good! I ordered the chicken and waffle dish, called the ""Wat Up doe"", I think. The chicken was seasoned well, but it was rather large. I'm into clean and non GMO, so the chicken sizes certainly raised some red flags for me. I would pay more for non GMO, free range chicken, hopefully they open another suburban location and offer it!  Overall all the food was great! The waitress was phenomenal, she took 6 orders without writing it down and it all came out right! I think her name was Andrea, she work on 10/9/16, give her a raise!!!"
2/15/2015,2 star rating,"Took my wife and daughter before the church rush.  Not exactly sure where to begin.  I respect the fact that Kuzzo's is going through growing pains.  Their service is mediocre. The front of house management is great.I ordered the Dark and Lovely with strawberries. It was supposed to be leg and thigh. I received leg and back with a blank waffle. My server told me she found out there were no strawberries when she placed the order.  Problem with the lie is why didn't you tell me when you placed the order?  My waffle was lukewarm due to the order sitting in the pass. Kuzzo's waffles have a great nose profile...too bad I sent mine back after I was lied to.My daughter had grits, chicken tenders and fries. The moment she discovered a hair with her chicken.   She was finished. She complained about the lack of seasoning in the grits. The fries were an oily floppy disaster. When I spoke with management, the gentleman was very polite and professional. He provided my daughter with a replacement traders and waffle. The problem exists in the kitchen. There is a quality control issue when one set of waffles is clearly under-cooked. A second waffle with beautiful color temperature and a third that looked flaccid. The manager provided my family with a replacement meal for us to go. We thanked him.  I wish that my sever would have just taken the same concern when it came to our issues.Kuzzo's has the potential to be the place, unlike another location north of the location."
5/14/2017,5 star rating,"This place is hoppin! And for good reason. The chicken is perfect! The waffles are very tasty. Not crunchy, but flavorful & perfect with the fried chicken. The cornmeal crusted shrimp was by far the tastiest shrimp I've ever had the pleasure to eat. And I've had shrimp pulled right out of the water. The shrimp at Kuzzos magically embodies the very essence of shrimpiness. Simply prepared, not over cooked, done right. Kuzzos is a small, bright, friendly, loud restaurant that will make all your soul food wishes come true! THE BEST!"
3/8/2015,4 star rating,"Came for brunch on the first Sunday after the grand opening. Knowing they would be very busy, I had low expectations for the food. I assumed the kitchen would be overwhelmed and the food quality would suffer.  I was WRONG!We arrived at 10:45am and waited 25 minutes to be seated. We were served our meals about 30 minutes later. The chicken was hot, juicy and full of flavor. The waffles were also excellent, served with warm maple syrup and whipped butter. The only food we didn't like was the biscuit which was pretty tough and chewy. Kudos to the hostess and our server were both excellent and very pleasant even though I know it was stressful. I will definitely be back."
8/22/2018,5 star rating,"Love this place - it's an epic soul meets brunch food, must visit Detroit establishment. Don't worry about the immediate area, it's safe in the daytime - I felt like Luke Cage walking tall down the block, hungry af. Even with a large menu, you can just tell they do a great job with all the items. Expect wait times to sit and wait times for the food to come out, on the weekends especially. Lot of people, in a somewhat smaller space - so hope you are not claustrophobic. Bathrooms are single only. The manager did come by and explain to us how food can take a little while to come out when they are busy and everything is being made fresh, from scratch. So there's a bar area known for some specialty cocktails, either brunchy or Long Island Iced Tea type drinks. Not a huge selection of Detroit beers, but I saw a few options. My usual go to meal is sort of best of both worlds. I get a small order of 2 whole wings and a waffle, side by side with a mini sized shrimp and cheesy grits. The whole wings are jumbo, juicy and hot on the inside, crispy golden fried on outside. The waffle was a bit limp but still tasty. Could have been baked a bit more stiff and crisped edges. The grilled shrimp and bacon bits sitting on a mini bowl of cheesy grits was so hearty - tasty! For soul meats brunch on a weekend - it does not get more Detroit or better than this place! Two thumbs up!"
7/16/2017,5 star rating,Waiters were really nice. Good location. Amazing cinnamon flavored waffles. Chicken wings were cooked perfectly.
1/5/2018,3 star rating,"Not my favorite by a long shot, but there isn't much else in the area. The fish was mushy (frozen), and the chicken was rubbery.  The cocktails are weak and surely if another decent restaurant opened on the avenue of fashion, this one would be redundant. Service was decent though."
5/26/2017,5 star rating,"Waiter was really attentive and the food was great. One of the better chicken and waffles places I've been to. I had just regular waffles and a breast piece. Yum. My boyfriend had the red velvet waffle and chicken fingers. He loved it. Said the wAffle was VERY sweet though. I also ordered Mac and cheese and biscuits + gravy. Both delicious. Especially the biscuits and gravy. If you're in Detroit, definitely give this place a try."

The only con I have is personally the koolaid is a bit to strong for me, but if you like really sweet drinks or the koolaid from the church that the lady with the overlapping elbows makes this is the go to for you trust me!!

6/25/2017,4 star rating,"After striking out on my first attempt to come due to a long wait, I arrived at 8:15 and got right in on a Sunday.  There are lots of interesting things to eat, but I stuck to the chicken and waffles.  I'll be back and branch out next time.  I order the tender lovin.  The chicken tenders were some of the of tenders I've ever had. The batter was crunchy with a sweetness to them. I really like the bbq sauce on the side, bbq sauces + maple syrup is a home run.  Huge portion size for the prize. The waffle was a bit soft and forgetable. I probably wouldn't order a waffle on its own.  The suicide Koolaid is a must. My food was out in less than 5 minutes which was awesome.  The restroom was disgusting and had flies in it.  Hold when you come here and enjoy the amazing people watching and stellar food."

Well I can say this was it. I had the build your own omelette and the BEST waffle. That I have eaten in a while. Everyone else was raven about the shrimp and grits, so I had to taste it. It was so well seasoned. Great place to go whenever you're in Detroit!!"

Our male bar tender was very attentive and assisted us in our meal selection.  The wait time for our meal was extreme, 45 minutes.  Once seated there was another 40 minutes  wait for the meal. Prior to seating there was a waitress sneezing in the already packed waiting area into her hands and then with the same contaminated hands handling  menus and handing out to guest.  Once we were seated at the bar she entered the bar area were she stood near the counter area across from us while we ate our meals with a tissue up her nostrils while we ate. I am not sure due to the extreme wait and poor universal precautions if i would be back."

These ladies are very friendly and well versed in the menu. Our food was hot, fresh and juicy! Red kool aid on point. Loved this place and look forward in giving them our business again. :)"
11/19/2017,1 star rating,Wait time for food was RIDICULOUS!!!! When I received my food the after taste of the Corned Beef Omelette was horrible. The Barmaid was very slow with ordering and getting the food and additional condiments. The place is too small to accommodate the crowd they have.
11/4/2018,1 star rating,I was so excited to eat here for the first time but it turned out to be one of the worst experiences. I feel like I spent my whole day here. The wait was over an hour and half. I felt worst for the people who were already there before us who waited for 2 hours. We were told 40-50 mins. Then when we finally sat down it was another 15 minutes until our waitress actually came up to our table. And when she did come up she seemed so bothered that she had to do her job. No smiles or enthusiasm. I felt like I was on her time. Customer service is so important and if they had good customer service I really wouldn't have minded waiting. I heard the hostess cussing at people who were complaining and giving her customers attitude. And when we finally got our food 45 mins later it was not as good as I was expecting. The chicken seemed as if it was refried it was impossible to cut. And then I had poached eggs that came 15 min after my food and when the waitress brought them out they were still in water! I had high expectations but first impressions are important. I don't know if I'd eat here again
2/17/2019,1 star rating,"This Place was so trash! The service was the WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED!! Took a whole 62 minutes for my food to come out. They Let other people get their food who came to the restaurant 15 minutes after I sat down and after I had already ordered! Then when I eventually got my food, they messed up my order! I'm SHOCKED & APPALLED that my family and I were handled so carelessly! If you still go to this restaurant after you read this review, you are crazy! The thoughts of me EVER coming here again, Are welllll beyond me! You all have a blessed Day!"

12/23/2018,1 star rating,The wait is horrid! I had a party of three and was told the wait would be 45 minutes to a hour which is reasonable on a Sunday. However we end up waiting for 2 hours plus the 1 hour wait for our food once we sat down. I ordered a steak and it smelled like ass! I had them take it back. This is unacceptable for food that really isn't the best! The waffles and chicken are they only thing worth ordering. I would suggest if you want to order something the best thing to do is get a carry out or you'll be waiting for 4 hours!
7/6/2017,4 star rating,We were seated immediately and awesome service provided by our server Dyamon. The fried green tomatoes was outstanding but the shrimp grits lacked favor and needed roux. The  Spiked Ice Tea made up for shrimp grits. My first time experience was satisfying.
8/30/2016,2 star rating,"Waited forever to be seated, when we were had a direct view into the kitchen where I saw white tubs filled with pink liquid an chicken sitting on floor. So I ordered the salmon croquettes an eggs which were pretty good just overpriced.  The chicken looks steroid huge an bulky not a premium cut of poultry. Would rather go to detroit eatery on Grand before wasting time an money here."
6/27/2017,4 star rating,Don't know where to start. It's perfect for every meal of the day especially brunch. Parking is always fun but it's worth it. Sometimes there's a wait but the drinks make up for it. Make sure you get the long island. The waffles are always buttermilk smooth. And the combos are will forever fill your taste buds. Prices good and service is nice. If you looking for a brunch spot to chill any day of the week come here. You won't be disappointed.
11/17/2016,4 star rating,"so glad to finally be able to review this place.is the wait time long on the weekends? YES.is it worth the wait time? maybe, just maybe.i came here with a party of 6 on a saturday afternoon around 1:30, hoping it would not be as busy. wrong. unfortunately there were some out of towners that took up a lot of space in the small restaurant, so the wait was an hour and a half. we debated on going elsewhere but decided to just wait.the hostess was super friendly and kept us updated on the wait time. the service was pretty spotty though. our waitress ended up screwing up our checks when swiping our cards so she had to refund everyone, not a big deal but a small annoyance.the food here is delicious, the chicken was my favorite part of everything. tried to perfection and not overly salty. the mac and cheese was okay, it had flavor but not enough cheese for my liking. what surprised me on this entire visit was the waffles, i am a belgium waffle girl myself and thought i would hate the thin waffles but they're super good. you could eat them without any syrup!the koolaid was good but nothing special, you could make it at home if you know what you're doing.i will be back but definitely not on a weekend!"
6/29/2016,5 star rating,Our food was excellent and the server Marshawn had a great knowledge of the menu offering up great suggestions and friendly service.
6/26/2016,4 star rating,"Easily one of my favorite places to grab breakfast or brunch! People complain about the wait, but the building space occupied by Kuzzo's isn't that large and it's usually more people trying to dine in than the facility can accommodate. Get there early and there should not be any issues with the wait. Each time that I go to Kuzzo's, the food never disappoints. The have some of the best chicken and waffles ever...and the Kool-Aid is so bomb!!"
6/24/2016,4 star rating,I have an addiction to the chicken and waffles with shrimp and grits. The service however is slow and the restaurant is always packed.
6/24/2016,5 star rating,"Excellent greens.  My wife and I are from the south, and tried this place one day.  The chicken is well above average, but the greens are incredible.  Also, the fried green tomatoes are crispy and tasteful.  Additionally, I placed an order for pick up, and, while I waited, had some of the koolaid.  This was delicious, and took me back to growing up as a kid down south.  We will be back soon."
6/23/2016,1 star rating,"The ambience of Kuzzo's Chicken and Waffles is absolutely spectacular!!! First our waitress, a beautiful young lady by the named Najah, was attentive, fast with service, knowledgeable, and conscientious. I would say she was the best waitresses I have ever had. She was by far the best thing about our experience at Kuzzo's Chicken and Waffles. She had a super kind disposition and service oriented demeanor. After her, it goes down hill. I ordered the Big Mama ( 2 pieces of fried chicken, honey-buttered cornbread muffin, and cheesy-grits. The chicken was fried just right; perfectly crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. Unfortunately it contained enough salt to cause an instant stroke. The cornbread muffin would have been perfect had it been warm. The cheesy grits were quite ""soupy"" without evidence of any seasoning. I couldn't even taste the cheese. Oh yeah, I had a side of eggs too. They were not good at all. Now to the highlight of the meal. Before the food came I was brought a huge mason-jar of lemonade big enough to swim in. It was simply the best, and certainly the highlight of the brunch; aside from our waitress. There were so many people waiting for tables our waitress literally had to wade through a sea of people with our uncovered food. Ugh! If I ever crave good service, I would definitely go back. If I wanted really good food I would try somewhere else!"

6/22/2016,2 star rating,"This place has potential but the service needs work. I visited in the morning during the week, the host were friendly, but it took a long time for a server to come to my table to greet me. Once the server finally came and took my order she never returned to see if I needed any thing else. I waited long as I could for her to return so that I could order a drink, and she never came so I walked to the bar to order a drink. The server never came back until she was bringing out my food order, not to mention this was a not a busy time. I would love to support the neighborhood businesses but the service needs work."
6/19/2016,1 star rating,"I understand what it is like to be busy.  So, today is Fathers Day and we went to have a Fathers Day brunch.  We totally expected it to be busy and to have to wait.  Upon checking in with the Hostess and a gentleman (I assume was the manager since he gave the impression he was in charge) we were tolf it would be 1 hour.  Not unusual for here on Sunday and we love the food so we decided to wait.  2 hours later we were still outside in the heat.  However, the people who were 2-4 in size (there eere 6 of us) kept getting seats after seats instead of them having to wait like we did.  There were several instances they could have slid a 2 top and a 4 top together and seat us.  Also, there were a couple of groups who came in that appeared to be friends of the manager and were seated right away.  This is my issue.  3 cars parked in the chained lot next to the building and were seated immediately.  VIP's?  Not on Fathers Day Sunday in my mind.  At the very least they should have sent someone out with water for us people who were out there 2 hours on a 90 degree Fathers Day.  Poor service and poor management.  Get someone who knows how to manage and is fair to all."
6/17/2016,5 star rating,"Since recently graduating from grad school I've taken a few small trips to random cities.  Once I arrived in Detroit, someone recommended that I hit up Kuzzos so I did.  The food was amazing.  I ordered the 'First Lady' which consisted of a chicken breast and a waffle.  The chicken was cooked to order, moist, tender, and bursting with flavor.  I've never visited an establishment that nailed everything the way it should be.  Also, service was SUPERB.  On my next visit I'm going to tip the waiter/waitress $100. Thanks"
6/14/2016,5 star rating,"I recently read an article about former Detroit Lion player, Ron Bartell, opening a restaurant in his old neighborhood to give back to the up and coming historic Detroit Ave of Fashion area located on Livernois and 7 Mile Rds. I added it to my list of places to try for brunch. One Sunday morning shortly after, it was my turn to pick places and I picked Kuzzo's, who's moniker is a familiar cultural term of endearment that describes a family like relationship. Upon entering you can't help noticing the beautiful decor that includes a large bar like seating area with a solid brick wall hosting a large sign defining the Kuzzo meaning. The other walls were brightly painted and covered serves as a gallery displaying hand painted art complete with a larger than life portrait of the late, great Tupac Shakur. We were told there would be a 15 minutes wait but were seated in 5 minutes. Service was great, food came out fast and was fresh and hot. Hubby opted for the ""Belle Isle Basket"" filled with southern fried catfish and heaping with fries. I opted for the ""What Up Doe"" combo complete with fried chicken, waffles, grits and cheese eggs. The food was exceptional and the waffles were hands down the best I've ever had. This place is a must try for any Detroit area brunchers out there."

10/7/2016,5 star rating,"One of my top favorite places to eat in Detroit. I always have pleasant service and food here. The Kool-Aid is BOMB.com and the Mac n cheese will make you slap ya mama, grandma and kids ok?!? We are here 10/5 our waitress was Val, she was nice and timely with drinks and taking our food order. My boyfriend ordered shrimp and grits, I had the ""First Lady"" which is a fried breast and waffle with mac n cheese & yams as my side, topped off with red Kool Aid and Mixed Kool-Aid to drink. Food was served fresh and hot, cheesy Mac, crisp skin on the chicken and fluffy waffles. My boyfriends grits were cooked perfect topped with seasoned peppers, onions, bacon and shrimp. I could not stop eating bites of his food while making sure to save enough of mine to take home to eat later lol. I wish they had a location close to my job in Ann Arbor and I would be all set :)"
11/6/2018,1 star rating,I have come here several times before but this time is by far the worst experience ever.. I have been here for almost 2 hours and still don't have my food!! And to make it all bad they don't say sorry I apologize for the wait or anything!!! This is terrible I mean damn they could bring you out a piece of toast or something.. Won't be back no time soon.
1/15/2016,5 star rating,"Our waitress (I think shanaye) was super nice and welcoming. We loved her! She offered to serve us HER special combination of red/blue/yellow koolaid and I'm glad we went along with it because the drinks were so pretty and it was some of the best koolaid ever (thick and sweet - perfect). We got the Lady combo (chicken breast & waffle) and it was definitely a solid choice given that this place has chicken & waffles in its name. We also ordered the Hattie something combo with catfish, yams, Mac n cheese and a side of shrimp and grits. Everything was good (catfish nice and crispy) but there was a lot of butter involved that wasn't necessary. Overall, I was happy with my meal and we're def coming back.Side note: the MUSIC being played in this restaurant was on point. I was jamming the entire time that I was eating."
12/28/2018,4 star rating,"If you're looking for indulgent comfort food this is your spot. The food is always excellent. I will say I have had to wait every time I go as they do not accept reservations or call aheads. The red velvet waffles are amazing. The Mac and cheese is a must for me every time. I have yet to have a piece of fried chicken that wasn't delicious, and bonus the leftovers re-heat very well. If you're someone that likes real sweet beverages you'd love their koolaid, and to be honest it just looks cool. The service is hit or miss. The last time I went it was down right bad. Had to track our server down for everything we needed, including utensils, refills and our bill. I've been there other times and had decent service as well. I love their bloody Mary's. I'm pretty picky about a good bloody and theirs checks all of my boxes. The art on the wall is great, really great. I like that they added a row of seating near the take-out counter for a waiting area, before it was awkward. All in all one of my favorite spots."
12/26/2018,1 star rating,"The staff absolutely SUCKS. Rude, lazy, acted like it was an inconvenience that we were there. Even the hostess had a tud. The fastest part of the experience was getting my credit card back. Needless to say my tip reflected my feelings. Never going back. Every bad review is not an exaggeration!! Everything not to do when running a restaurant, this place does! UGH!!!"
3/4/2016,5 star rating,Best chicken and waffles I have ate since I moved back to Michigan from Memphis! Definitely will be coming back again!
6/16/2019,2 star rating,"I would rate the food five stars, however the service/overall experience I have to give them a 0. We waited 45 minutes for our table which is understandable as the venue is small. However, we waited 30 minutes before a waitress even acknowledged us and gave us water and another 30 minutes before our order was taken. Our original waitress had a bad attitude and handed us off to another waitress who was actually really nice. Despite her effort our food took another 1 hour to come out and when it did come the entire order was not delivered and we had to wait another 15 minutes for the rest of the food. Overall we spent close to four hours from start to finish for fried chicken and waffles. As I stated the food was good but they just haven't developed a rhythm in serving their customers. I really liked the ambience of the venue and there is great potential. I recommend hiring a staff with a experience serving large crowds to change this place around."
9/18/2018,2 star rating,Tried this place today for the first time. Nice decor and nice presentation but service was very slow. One hour and 10 minutes for 2 sandwiches at 2 o'clock in the afternoon is ridiculous.  Our  waitress literally disappeared before we could pay our bill. Had to leave the bill with the hostess because our waitress literally vanished. Won't be back.
12/16/2018,1 star rating,This place needs to close and start over the service is terrible the staff is unprofessional and rude there is no reason to sit down after waiting almost a hour order food and have to wait over an hour for your order to come out management needs to step in and get things back in working order

9/14/2018,3 star rating,"I've been to Kuzzo's a few times. I've brought family here, I've ate here with friends, and every time I've dined in. I've had a good experience, other than the wait I can't complain, but this one particular day I was getting a takeout. THE WORSE IDEA OF MY LIFE! Literally waited an hour and a half for 4 meals. I was really out done with it. All they could say is ""it's busier than usual"". Smh, no way I should've waited that long so 2 big thumbs down from me ‍."
6/24/2015,1 star rating,"This place has gone steadily downhill. Happened upon it the first day it opened and was thrilled -- no wait, great chicken and waffles, cool decor. Staff friendly and welcoming. So friendly in fact that I complimented them to the manager when he stopped by our table to welcome us.  Boy, are those days gone.....  The waits have gotten ridiculously long, and the staff's manners have all but disappeared. It's a long wait to get a table, and then FOREVER before the food arrives.   Today was my fourth and final visit. Hostess was painfully hostile and unfriendly. Put our name on a list, even though there were at least six seats available at the bar and two 2-top tables available in that room, as well as other tables in the main dining area. Maybe half dozen people waiting -- but why?  Plenty of seats available. No friendly greeting -- no ""hello, welcome to Kuzzos"". Instead, it was a young hostess full of attitude and hostility. When I asked if we could sit at the bar, I was told those seats are also included in her list. Three women walked in after us and headed for the bar -- she barked at them as well. It was so unwelcoming, unprofessional, and uncaring that we promptly turned around and left. Headed to a restaurant in Ferndale where we were greeted warmly, seated immediately -- and the food was just as good. Good luck, Kuzzos. We were glad to have you in the neighborhood, but you're fast wearing out your welcome."
12/9/2018,1 star rating,"They are extremely busy and because of that, customerservice is thrown out the window. My family was thrown out because they wanted to make room for others. I will never eat here again."
10/6/2016,3 star rating,Kuzzo's is fine but grossly overrated.  We were expecting something special and it's not. Of course we had the chicken and waffles-one order with pieces and one with tenders as well as a side of cheese grits.  The waffles are the highlight-very light but with a lot of flavor.  The grits had almost no flavor and I wouldn't order them again.  The chicken was really nothing special and actually on the dry side.  There are literally 100 other places in the city where you can get fried chicken that is better than this.  The staff were all very friendly and our waitress was great.  I also like that they service Great Lakes coffee.  In the end it was fine but definitely not worthy of the hype or the long lines on the weekends.
10/13/2018,1 star rating,"The food is great if you actually get the opportunity to eat it. We called ahead for a party of 8 to celebrate birthdays, this was supposed to be the highlight of our birthday celebration. Their line was off the hook because they got tired of answering people's calls. We wait for the hour they said it would take to be seated, then when the hour is up,they told us we'd have to wait an additional thirty minutes. Almost every table that was in there had NO food all the people we asked said they have been waiting over an hour to get food. One group said they had been there THREE HOURS and had no food!!! They need to either get a bigger establishment where they can seat more people, or get more staff. Perhaps both. My friends and I drove over an hour away to celebrate our birthday here and we left frustrated and hungry. This is not the first time something like this happened. As much as I enjoy their food, I won't be coming back because that is absolutely RIDICULOUS I hope they're realize they're losing money in the dozens of people that leave  due to insufficient space and staff."
12/1/2018,2 star rating,"The food here is amazing. The kool-aid, waffles, and chicken are stellar, but you have to wait FOREVER to get it. I've spent hours of my life in this restaurant that I will never get back between waiting to sit down, waiting to order, waiting to receive the food, waiting for the bill, and waiting to get my card back. The servers also never come check up on you to refill waters. The restaurant is small and there appears to be a large staff, so the long waiting periods aren't explained well, and no one ever apologizes for having the customers wait so long for their food."
5/18/2017,5 star rating,"To put it simply - this place is amazing!! I'm now trying to schedule brunch dates with all of my friends to bring them here too. If you like chicken and waffles, you'll LOVE this place. If you like kool-aid and cocktails, you're in for a treat!"
5/14/2017,5 star rating,Yes it takes a while to get food but when you do it is more than worth it. The large portions of perfectly cooked comfort food complement their homey yet hip atmosphere.

8/22/2016,5 star rating,"Kuzzos is probably one of the soul food restaurants in the metro Detroit area.  The service is top notch. The food taste as if it is straight out of grandmothers kitchen. The atmosphere is welcoming with an rustic urban flare. Sorry, if I can't share any complaints."
12/21/2018,3 star rating,"Food is delicious but the wait time for the food/seat is ridiculous. Definitely needs to expand their kitchen staff. I waited 45 minutes for my food and was still served before two people in front of me who were there since I first walked in. So, they definitely waited over an hour for their food. Only come here if you have 3-4 hours blocked in your schedule, with a good book or Netflix movie to watch while you wait, which is what I did. I read a significant portion of my book while waiting. I had nothing better to do so I relaxed and waited, but I'm sure that's not a typical customer. The staff is also rude and apathetic to the long wait time. I really want to give a Black owned business a great review, but there are some logistics they need to work through to run a smooth business."
4/2/2016,5 star rating,This is my daughter and my favorite place for breakfast/brunch. We always get the red.velvet waffle (she gets wings and I get tenders). The only complaint I have is they are so popular that there is always a long wait. But the food is worth the wait.
11/12/2018,1 star rating,Went there on a Saturday which I understand can be busy but it was not overcrowded our wait for a table was 40 minutes once we were seated it was another hour long wait to get the food in fact my guest took a nice nap. I was starving so I ordered a $6 side salad which was very small and had about 10 leaves of lettuce and four croutons..when the food came out it was ice cold...I ordered the Big 3 ..chicken tenders and fries..he ordered the what up doe..the waffle was so cold the butter didnt melt grits and eggs were also cold..I ate some fries the chicken was too cold to eat ..he definitely couldnt eat the cold waffle and grits..they redid his order..by this time it came out the 2nd time  we were tired and got carry outs..the manager offered 15% off the bill..unfortunately something didnt agree with my stomach (i suspect it was the salad) and I was on the toilet for the rest of the night..horrible experience will not return or recommend
11/11/2018,1 star rating,"This was quite possibly the WORST experience I have had at ANY restaurant. After sitting for 2 hours we get our food cold with no explanation and no apology . People walking out because of the  wait but still  expected to pay for their  drinks The staff was literally telling people it's gonna be greater than an hour stay or don't. Even after asking for the manager and having to ask for something off of my bill, I waited an additional 20 minutes...this is CRAZY"
2/26/2016,4 star rating,"Bomb! I enjoyed every bit of it. The wait was quite long on a mid-Saturday afternoon but I can't hold it against them, the food is worth waiting for. We ended up sitting at the bar while we ate but the woman working was so nice, fun, and attentive that it didn't really bother me (although I generally prefer booths). This was just a great experience and I'd definitely go back to support this local business!"
12/26/2016,5 star rating,"My partner and I traveled an hour or so just to visit this establishment. There was a bit of a wait, but it was well worth it. The food was great, the drinks were strong (we both had the Long Island). The vibe was also right. I'd recommend this place."
12/22/2016,4 star rating,Very nice restaurant small but classy. The food was very good but long wait time I would say it's worth the wait. It's beautiful to have a place like this in Detroit not the suburbs.
12/18/2015,3 star rating,"First let me say, the food was pretty good. The customer service was decent but the wait time was a downer. I ordered the shrimp and grits(I added salt and pepper), Two wings(very flavorful),Mac and chz(yum) and collard greens(delicious)...the shrimp and grits were good but it wasn't outstanding. There were 4 of us at a table..the waitress proceeded to bring our orders out separately and then we were informed that there would be a wait for the Mac and chz (another 1/2 hr.) after our food was served. The collard greens were excellent...once the Mac and chz finally arrived,it was great!  They don't have  Appetizers, the drinks were good tho. Wait times can be lengthy so you may want to have a snack readily available. Overall, I'll try it again...better luck next time."
4/11/2016,1 star rating,"I've grown accustomed to the unprofessional service often provided by inner city establishments, this place was no exception.  Our waitress was rude, inattentive and vocalized how she wished it would snow more so she could go home.  This was my first and last dining experience at this restaurant.  Truly sad because the look of this place is cool and the food wasn't bad.  You're better off spending your money elsewhere!  The only time you'll see your waitress is when she takes your order and then returns to drop off the check."

3/1/2016,2 star rating,"The kool-aid, fish, muffin & greens are good. However,  the waffle was like a matted up rug and the macaroni n chz was Very Dry. I didn't say anything to the waiter about the waffle.  But, I'm serious about my Mac n chz. So I asked him if it was ordinarily that dry. His reply was no. It's usually much better. That was it. That was all. He walked away brought my bill back and here I sit writing this feeling Completely disappointed after all the Hype about Kuzzos food being sooooo good."
12/25/2015,5 star rating,"I absolutely love this establishment,  first of all its black owned, the service was great, the location was great, wait time not bad at all, dining area was clean and showed some of the history of Detroit. And for the best part, The Food, the food was impeccable,  I ordered the BIG Mama's the chicken was a crispy golden brown seasoned well, I had yams, greens, and potatoes, all delicious, but I enjoyed the cornbread the most lol, buttery and delicious. Overall experience was excellent."
5/12/2018,3 star rating,"Kuzzos is a great breakfast spot in the morning. The girls are so professional and food is consistent except when they have new cooks, which is very often. We have been frequenting at least once a week  since they open. Like I said without the wait staff the place would crumble.  Managers are changed on a monthly basis. They never visit the guests and ask ""how's your food and experience""? We did have a complaint during a late evening visit and we were horrified. The pop machine hoses weren't clean. The pop was served to us tasted like dirty dish water that left a nasty taste in our mouths.  The server (she was terrible) ignored our request for a manager as if we would be bothering him. After sitting there in an uncrowded restaurant and watching the manager avoid us, we kind had to make a scene for him to acknowledge us. After we gave him got gripes he just grabbed the glass and ran off. He clearly isn't built for managing. So the morning service is supurb! The evening service was subpar. Thus 3 stars."

I was seated at the bar and had to wait a little longer for our food to come out but we didn't mind due to great conversations over a mug of koolaid. I would like to say that the food was well worth the wait. I had a red velvet waffle, chicken wings with a side of Mac and cheese. No complaints from me and I will definitely be back."
2/22/2017,4 star rating,"I have been wanting chicken and waffles since I came to Detroit! I'm glad my fam took me here. It was delicious. Being a Louisiana girl, the grits could have had a bolder taste and tone down the shrimp but they were still good. I will definitely be back."
7/11/2016,4 star rating,"Good waffles, great chicken! Also a few good drinks to make it a brunch! Try the ""Tender Love,"" comes with some of the best chicken tenders I've ever had!"
10/11/2018,1 star rating,This was the worst food I've eaten and the service was equally horrible. I would caution anyone to avoid this place because I became ill after eating what I now believe was undercooked chicken. The waffles were bland and tasteless. They had a texture that put me in the mind of chewing on a sponge. All I will say about the service is that it took a half hour for us to receive our food. I can't understand why this place is in business.
10/9/2018,5 star rating,"We went to Detroit just to visit  the Motown museum . We stopped in for lunch.  We were enthusiastically greeted  by the most welcoming  hostess ever, (Janine) she was sweeter then the red velvet waffles. She said it's and hour Waite but it's well worth the Waite .... how could we say no to that and she was right.  The food was well reasoned, hot, and  delivered fast. I'm a Vegetarian and the selections were many my husband had chicken and waffles and he loved it, steam was coming off the chicken as he was cutting into it I highly recommend this place truly soulful food and people."
1/2/2016,5 star rating,I've been here several times and the food and service has been great every single time. The best time to go to avoid the rush is early Sunday morning. My family and I have never had a wait going at this time. The waffles are always fresh and very good. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and cooked just right. Prices are average. The atmosphere is great and the staff is always professional. This place is definitely a gem.
2/5/2017,4 star rating,"Food was awesome!! Everything was so hot and fresh. It's a pretty small place and very well decorated, would not recommend for big parties. Food and service takes awhile, but everyone was really polite! Definitely the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. The drinks are pretty strong too."
10/3/2018,1 star rating,"I've came here before and the food was amazing but when I arrived the wait wasn't long but when I asked to be seated In a booth the hostess was very rude and not welcoming. I don't understand what was so hard to seat me at a booth if their was two booths available, later on the manager came and apologized to us."
6/24/2016,4 star rating,I have an addiction to the chicken and waffles with shrimp and grits. The service however is slow and the restaurant is always packed.
9/28/2018,1 star rating,Very poor service. They are cutting their breasts in half and charging you full price. I had to wait over an hour for my carry out. The last time I came they were out of chicken strips.
8/6/2015,4 star rating,"Bustling, noisy and yummy. There were lines at lunchtime on Thursday. The portions are huge and everything was really tasty, but it would be a challenge eating here if you're a vegan or vegetarian. Clean and great service, but so loud it's hard to have a conversation or hear anything but the rumble. I will be back!"
11/28/2015,5 star rating,"The best tasting heart attack you've ever had. The chicken is delicious, the sides are excellent (I had the yams and they were great). Drinks are decent enough, good size. Staff friendly but it's always busy with so many people."
7/18/2016,5 star rating,"Really great food!  Went with my hubby,  daughter and in laws on a Sunday.  I thought it was a bad idea.  I'm notorious for not wanting to dine at restaurants on Sunday afternoons.  The wait was about an hour and it was worth it!  Everything was really good.  Service was on point and sorry to say it usually is not in some restaurants."
12/16/2015,1 star rating,"So as we walked toward kuzzos we saw an empty table through the window and as we got inside only one person was waiting to be seated. We approached the hostess and gave our name, Then glanced in the dining room yep that tables still empty, 35 minutes later that table was still empty and we were still waiting so we left. Wont be back."
9/15/2016,3 star rating,"The waffles are OK (I like Belgian waffles better they only make the Red Velvet Belgian style), the chicken a little better than average. But the REAL star is the Kool-Aid!!!!  5 stars for the Kool-Aid!"
4/23/2016,3 star rating,"When approaching the restaurant it looks very nice on the outside. However depending on which side of the street you come down, the neighborhood isn't the greatest. We waited for 10-15min to be seated without even being acknowledged. A customer also waiting went to get the manager to get us seated. I ordered the First Lady which is chicken breast and a waffle. The chicken was dry and the batter was not seasoned enough. The waffle was great. The lemonade was very sweet. Blue koolaid was good. Collard greens were salty. My friends and I were hit on several times by the staff in the course of our time there which was unprofessional. The prices were reasonable except the drinks were too pricey. Overall I support black businesses but they have to do better."
6/22/2016,5 star rating,"This place is GOOODDDDDD and cheap. The perfect combo. The wait can be long on the weekends, so come early!"
3/26/2016,5 star rating,"If you're a Chix & Waffles fan this is a must try.  Me and a friend both ordered the  TREY-DEUCE which includes 3pcs of Chicken (Breast, Leg & Wing) and 2 Waffles.  The Chicken is large in size, moist and delicious.  The Waffles are thin but tasted very good.  I'm not a Waffle aficionado by no means but I didn't mind them being on the thin side even though some of other reviewers didn't like them that way.  Also, they are topped with a large amount of butter.  I swiped a large portion off to the side so you may want to ask for the butter on the side if you want to better manage your butter intake.  However, I believe you realize going in that this is not going to be a diet-friendly meal."

7/15/2018,5 star rating,"Great music and environment and even better food! Love the chicken and waffles, yams, greens and mac n cheese!"
3/18/2015,5 star rating,"This place is everything! The chicken is yum! The waffles... OMG! I'm drooling just thinking about them. I must admit that I'm a big chicken and waffles fan and I'm kind of a snob about it. So when we decided to try this place on a Sunday afternoon I was kind of skeptical. Who would've known that this place was going to be so incredibly awesome! The chicken was so fresh and fried to perfection. It didn't even need hot sauce! And I decided to get the buttermilk waffles which had a hint of vanilla and cinnamon I believe... I was in total bliss! The syrup added just the right amount of sweetness. I also had mac and cheese, which was pretty decent but not like my Aunt's so I'll try something else next time. My fiancé loved his yams as well. I can't wait to go back to I can try the shrimp and grits. This place is a winner in my book!"
9/2/2018,1 star rating,"Long story short...customer service, accuracy, and overall operations needs to be looked at. This was my first time trying this place and the last. There was a 2 hour wait because the host took down the wrong number to alert us for table. We sit down and eat finally and the food is just ok and luke warm. Then there's pipes up high that are leaking condensation while you eat. One of the staff members comes out with a towel on a broomstick and tries to wipe the pipes that are up high. Getting people wet and over a child's head. I couldn't believe it. I hope that they work on creating a better dining atmosphere."
11/11/2015,2 star rating,"Never got a chance to eat had to wait for at least 20 min and left, the entire time tables in my view had not been served. Has a large bar that takes up a lot of space that could be used for tables. Not sure why this place needs a bar. May try again one day."
12/28/2017,1 star rating,"This place sucks BIG time and I'm not mainly talking about the hour wait to be seated or the hour and half to get our wrong,cold, incomplete orders. They really need alot of training and better management in here. They don't have to worry about me spending no more money with them. We have to do better as black business and us as customers must stop settling for subpar service."
5/26/2018,1 star rating,"Waited an hour and 45 minutes to get 3 items for take out. Arthur didn't help us till 20 min of waiting. Rang up the wrong order on my card. After waiting an hour and 15 minutes they gave us someone else's order. Kyle just looked at us and said ok we'll have to remake it. Asked if it's gonna take another hour and he said I hope not. The other customer with our food came back 25 minutes later and Arthur and Kyle just said ok your food is here. Our food was cold and missing things once we got it and they didn't even try to compensate for all the time and mistakes made by a single boy. We asked if we could just get a refund and leave before the other customer came back but they said no just give us a moment making us wait. We ended up just leaving because they gave us attitude for their mistake. Place seemed racist because there were similar races to Arthur and Kyle coming in and only waiting for 20-30 min. While we, and other people of different color were all complaining about the hour wait we're already enduring. Arthur and Kyle were either racist or just to busy hitting on the women at the bar we were sitting next to taking pictures and giving them free drinks. We were never offered a water while we waited."
8/5/2016,2 star rating,Incredibly ridiculous wait.   3  groups of people who entered & put their names down after us were seated before us. 2 were the same size party. I eventually left (after waiting for 25 minutes). There were also flies which maybe isn't the worst thing in a restaurant in the summer but... Won't be back.
3/25/2015,1 star rating,"STAY AWAY until management fixes this place. This place is a huge disappointment. The wait time alone is enough for patrons to never return. We waited well over the time the waitress stated to us as we watched tables sit empty. Once seated no water no apology we watched as other patrons were served who clearly came in after us. The food is not worth it at all, it's overpriced. How about it took over an hour for our food to come out. Frankly if you want a chicken & waffle experience stick to New Center Eatery where they service you right."
8/23/2018,2 star rating,"My first experience here was great. Can't say enough about the food, delicious! Totally worth the wait. Unfortunately my second and LAST experience here was not up to par. The customer service was awful, Kahila I believe, was especially unhelpful. First, we were seated in an uncomfortable spot and proceeded to wait 30 minutes. Then asked to be moved away from the a/c because we were freezing, the restaurant was half empty with no wait mind you; they were unable to move us. Waited another 20 minutes for our food and my girlfriend needed to get a jacket because we were literally freezing by this time. Forgot the strawberries on our waffles and needed to get them ""from next door."" Did not need to know that. It's extremely frustrating and unfortunate that employees could ruin an otherwise fantastic place. Too bad."
8/23/2018,2 star rating,"This was my first visit to Kuzzos and I'm not sure if I want to ever go back.  We arrived at 12:35P on a Tuesday when it was half empty.  We had a party of 7.  Five of us were already waiting and 2 were parking but we had to wait another 8 min for them to walk in before all of us could be seated.   We were seated for over 30 minutes before we got water.  We watched our waitress Tandra (who was horrible) tend to other tables that got there after us before she finally took our orders almost an hour after we were seated.  I finally got up to complain and then our food came out.  She forgot one person's order.  She never came back to check on our table.  Our grits were served cold, although the chicken, fish and waffles were hot and tasted good. It took forever to get our bill.  Another waitress came out to ask for our orders AGAIN so she could bill us.  When asked where our original waitress was, we were told she was ""handling"" business.   In a nutshell, food was decent.  Atmosphere was cozy, but service was TERRIBLE.  Work on the service and serve the food"
6/28/2018,5 star rating,In a day when everyone is doing chicken and waffles Kuzzos is doing it the best!  Great fresh soft waffle with real butter and excellent plump and juicy chic Ken tenders.  A must try!
2/21/2016,3 star rating,"Red velvet waffles and chicken. Yummmy!!!!!However, the service is terrible. They are soooo rude. Food is good but not good enough to deal with the rude waitresses and staff. Even when I called in one time, the person who picked up was unwelcoming and blunt. I was just asking a simple question. Sheesh!C'mon Kuzzos, you're a black owned business. We want to support you but not at the expense of decent customer service. Do better."

3/26/2015,5 star rating,Delicious! Had the red velvet waffles and wings. With a alcoholic lemonade with basil.  So good.  The green beans and other sides were all totally fresh and super yummy. Nothing tasted preprepared or canned.  Bits of bacon in the green beans. I'll be back a bunch!
1/31/2015,5 star rating,"I tried the Sweet Daddy, a sweet potato waffle with fried chicken fingers along with smothered hash browns. Everything was supreme! I recommend the fresh homemade lemonade AND the Kool-Aid .. Totally awesome. They had valet service the day i visited but in not sure if that is a regular service. Parking is at a premium on Livernois so be prepared to scout and walk- I'm sure you'll agree it's worth it. Cheers!"
11/7/2015,4 star rating,"My friend picked up carry out from here last night and it was delicious! They don't take carry out orders over the phone and she did have to wait like a half hour to get the food so we had very high expectations and they were met. I had the big red which is a red velvet waffle with chicken tenders and I had mac and cheese on the side...all 3 were yummy. My friend had fried chicken, catfish, greens, yams and cornbread...she ate it all & said it was very good. I think it's pretty safe to say her and I will both be back but perhaps next time we'll eat in, at least we can have drinks if it's taking a long time."
3/18/2015,1 star rating,"I usually do not write reviews, but this is a simple experience to capture in a short review. Expect to wait for an extremely long time whether you call in and place an order for take out (which I believe they recently stopped doing) or dine-in. You cannot justify waiting an hour or more for fried food or a waffle. It's unbelievable. Twice was enough for me. I won't be back. I'll also add, the one time I ordered carry out and waited in the waiting area for it, someone from the kitchen brought 4 bags of orders out and set them on the designated table where a waitress would then check the name and give the order to you. The bags sat there for 10 minutes in front of us before she showed up from whatever she was doing and gave us our soon to be cold food (after 50 minutes of waiting for 5 chicken tenders to-go)."

7/21/2015,3 star rating,"Be ready for a long wait and a tight squeeze.  After being told about the restaurant, my family of 6 decided to try the new neighborhood place.  The interior is cute and the servers friendly.  However,  the wait for the table was about 30 minutes.  Since there was no booth that would fit our party adequately, we had an extension table added that put part of my group in the aisle way.  So needless to say they were constantly interrupted moving so that servers and other guests could pass by. Most of the group ordered waffles and chicken I ordered the red velvet waffles with fried chicken my daughter ordered an omelette. Everyone was pleased with the majority of the food that we were given even though it took awhile to get it all out. No one was a fan of the home fries and my daughter didn't really care for the omelette. The plain buttermilk waffles and wings were good however the red velvet waffles were thick and dry.  The kool-aid with all the flavors mixed together was really good.  It was an okay experience, although I felt it was greatly overpriced (for 2 wings and a waffle)."
4/20/2015,3 star rating,"First time at Kuzzo's for brunch and I was quite pleased! I had Shrimp and Grits! The grits were creamy with just enough butter and cheese. The shrimp were large, slightly spicy and flavorful. The dish was topped off with smoked bacon, scallions and a variety of peppers. The serving was huge and I could not eat all of it . The Fried Chicken was hot and well seasoned . The Red Velvet waffle was moist and to top it off I had the largest jar of grape Koolaid that had just the right amount of lemonade and sugar! The Decor is vibrate and unique. The bricks and some of the walls are painted and there are hand painted pictures of President Obama and other artist that add a nice touch. The wait was long, but that is usually the case with new restaurants so expect it. As far as parking if you live in Detroit you're familiar  with Livernois and the parking can be a challenge, so no need to act brand new about the parking situation . I would visit again just not on a Sunday."
3/15/2018,2 star rating,"My partner just picked me up from the airport. Just got back from New Orleans and I'm craving biscuits. It's Wednesday around 6pm. No wait to be seated but took a while for waitress to actually come to our table. Ordered an Arnold Palmer, ""Granny Plum"" 2 waffles, 2 eggs, a bowl of grits, and added cheese to the butter...I mean grits. Also got the ""Belle Isle basket"" of fried shrimp. Got peach cobbler, corn bread and of course the biscuits. The presentation of the Arnold Palmer was pretty, served in a huge mason jar. The taste on the other hand was not Arnold Palmer it was soooo sweet to the point where all you taste is sugar. I took a sip out of my partners coke right after and the Arnold Palmer made the coke taste healthy and not as sweet. The waffles had two big scoops of butter on top. I wanted an extra plate so we can share (also got sunny side eggs and I didn't want yolk in my waffles). Our waitress passed by so many times, free hands, in and out of the kitchen and still no plate. At that point the butter melted and drenched the waffles (now cold and soggy from butter). Grits, I honestly feel like there was more butter in the grits than grits. Cornbread hard as a rock, but flavor on point minus a tooth. The peach cobbler we ordered at the beginning we got to go and was also a fail. It was tooooo sweet and made with canned peaches. The fried shrimp was too salty. Fries tasted fresh cut and homemade, they were by far the best fries I've had in Detroit. And finally the biscuits, I was sooo disappointed. Drenched in honey and butter and sooo sweet (maybe ask for honey/butter on the side so you can control how much you want on it). The combination of everything we ordered 90% was butter and sugar. The 10% was all the other ingredients. If they cut back on the sugar just a lil at least to the same sweetness as a coke the food/drink would've been great. Cut back on the butter in the waffles and grits. I get that the amount of butter on the waffles makes for better presentation, but I really can't understand the grits..it's already melted by the time it's served, so it makes no sense. There's no balance in the food to the point where it looses its essence. You can't taste the actual food because it's drenched in sugar or butter or both."
4/29/2015,5 star rating,The wife and I went here for date night and were not disappointed .  She had the shrimp and grits and I had the catfish.  Let's just say Grandma would be proud.  Great service and drinks too.  The Ultimate Margarita is exactly that.  We will be adding this place to our go to list.  Great decor and people too.  Go during the week to avoid the crowd also.
2/9/2015,1 star rating,"Unfortunately, we tried ordering from Kuzzo's this past Saturday and we were treated horribly,  by the women on the phone. The one who answered was nice, it was the one talking in the background. After calling we were placed on hold for over ten minutes. As we were ordering the young lady said they didn't have one of the items someone in our party was trying to order, so we asked them to hold just a second to get an alternative Item. The girl in the background goes REALLY THEY'RE PLACING YOU ON HOLD FOR A TO GO ORDER..  that's when we changed our mind stating that the only reason she was placed on hold is because Kuzzo's didn't have something that was listed on the menu! And after having Us on hold for over ten minutes you would think they could hold for a half of second since they inconvenienced us... maybe we'll try some other time, because the food did look good..."
3/27/2015,1 star rating,How does it take over an hour to get your food?..I so wanted to like this place but sorry...the hostess...waitress..great! The kitchen is slow.
5/11/2016,3 star rating,"Just ok.  I have been three times and the wait was over 45 minutes each time.  The food is good and the drinks are better. The chairs are very uncomfortable, the sides of the chairs cut into my body as I am sitting so I request to sit a booth which makes my wait longer."
5/7/2016,4 star rating,"Friday night was our first time at Kuzzo's and it was great! The chicken was crispy on the outside and hot and moist on the inside. The spice blend is perfect. I had the Dark & Lovely combo and the thigh was huge! The waffle was just right. If you expect a waffle to be boring, this one will change your mind. I had it plain with butter, but next time I'm asking for syrup. The side of candied yams were hot and spot on for sweetness. We both had the homemade lemonade and they come in huge Kerr jars with lots of ice. I was wondering about the charge for refills, but now I understand. Unless you just ran a marathon you probably won't need a refill anyway. We are definitely going back because there are other sides to sample and I want to try the Kuzzo's Long Island with Faygo."
2/26/2015,5 star rating,"Tried the chicken legs and waffles today (the bam bam?), with a side of Mac and cheese (because I have to try Mac and cheese everywhere I go). The waffle was delicious. Sweet, with a hint of maybe cinnamon in it. The legs were great too. I got three smaller ones and it was plenty. The mac was good homemade stuff. No complaints at all. Also loved the price. For the chicken and waffle and side of mac was $10.40. Amazing! We didn't wait for a table because we came during lunch break. We got it to go, and while it's a little crowded in the back where they take the to-go orders, they do have chairs for waiting and the staff was very friendly. There were 5 of us and we waited about 30 minutes for our orders. I didn't think that was unreasonable. Next time we'll call our orders in first. And there will definitely be a next time! I can't wait to try some of the other dishes. Kudos to Kuzzo's!"
10/30/2015,3 star rating,"Damn. I really wanted to like this place. The service was really really slow and the food was only okay. I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy plus two scrambled eggs - no cheese. My friend ordered the Lala with a side of chicken breast. My eggs were wrong and my friend's were too salty. I asked for them to remake mine but by the time they came out, I had finished the rest of my meal so it wouldn't be cold. Our waitress was very nice, but still slow to refill water and see how the food was. She said the manager was coming out but they never did so we left after paying the bill that was cut in half. Overall not terrible, but disappointing."
10/28/2015,4 star rating,"Soo good. Tia really took care of us. My first time trying chicken and waffles and I wasn't disappointed. Mac and Cheese = delicious. My BF says he likes it better than Slows. Potatoes = delicious. In a mix with onions and peppers. For desert we had the deep fried Oreos, again yum. For all of the food that we had, I was surprised that the bill wasn't crazy. Great food and good prices, can't beat that. Did I mention their delicious lemonade/Kool-aid? I will definitely be going back for more!"

10/17/2015,3 star rating,"My boyfriend and I drove from Canada to check out Kuzzos, when we arrived it was extremely busy which is a sign of good food to me!  It was just the two of us so we were seated right away, unfortunately the table we were given was tucked away in the corner right beside the waiting area. It was hard for me to enjoy my meal with a man waiting for a table standing directly behind me breathing down my back. We also had a couple stand directly in front of our table as if we weren't even there.  The food was decent, the waffle had a great flavour but it was extremely soggy, not crisp like I had hoped.  The chicken tenders and mac & cheese were very good!  The music was so loud I could hardly hear my boyfriend or the waitress, everyone around us had to yell to talk making it even more louder.  The service was pretty good we were in and out in a bout an hour.  We had an overall okay experience, the food was good, I would stop by again if I was in the area but wouldn't go out of my way."
10/12/2015,4 star rating,"The food here was delicious!  I had the chicken and waffles and it was so good!  The waffles (not Belgian) are served with warm syrup and lots of butter - who wouldn't be happy?  My sister ordered the 3 pce chicken and waffles and  a shrimp and grits - serving sizes were huge, so she had plenty to take home.  Our only thing was that we were a party of 8 - our bad, we should have made a reservation.  There was only 1 table to seat that many and people eat very leisurely there! We pointed out that we would be willing to separate our party to 2 separate but close tables, so it worked fine.  Service was good and staff was really friendly.  We will return and they have carry out too!"

9/26/2015,1 star rating,"I'll start by saying I don't mind waiting for spectacular food...that aside, I do mind waiting for mediocre food and sub par service. I went to Kuzzo's for my first time expecting amazing food from what I've heard. My wait was only 30 mins on a Saturday so that's not bad at all, however while I was sitting down I saw many empty seats and many people waiting outside.Our waitress was nice but very slow! I never got my water refilled the whole time I was there. The wait for the food was long, but we did get the big red (red velvet waffle and chicken). The chicken was perfectly seasoned, crispy and juicy! That's where my accolades end. The waffle, the star, was very dry and didn't have much flavor. I was warned to get the cream cheese sauce on the side and I'm glad I did, it was very thick and way too sweet. The eggs weren't special, in fact I prefer the eggs I make at home to these. The music was very loud and I spent my time yelling at my friends. I usually don't let one bad experience stop me from giving a restaurant another chance, but there wasn't much here that made me feel like a second chance would make a difference. Once was enough."
9/19/2015,4 star rating,"GREAT fried chicken! Came here for dinner at 5 PM on a Saturday. We were told there would be a 30 minute wait but it ended up being less than five minutes. Be prepared because the service here is very slow. The servers are attentive enough but it takes the kitchen a long time to get the food out. I waited an additional 10 minutes for my shrimp and grits after my husband received his chicken and waffles which we'd waited quite awhile for already. The only odd thing I experienced here was that I handed a cash tip into our server and she just said ""oh"" and started talking to the table next to us.  The food was very, very good and we will definitely return. Parking is not great at all but we lucked out and were able to park near the edge of the lot off the alley."
6/18/2015,1 star rating,"I love the look of the Kuzzo restaurant but as usual I had to suffer through the slow unorganized service as our people (African Americans) always do it .... bad attitude server ... slow waitress ... cold & half cooked food ... the main reason for me coming into the place was to try the ""Big Red"" red velvet waffle but after I placed my order about 5 minutes later the waitress comes out to tell me they were out of them ... how are you going to be out of your premiere waffle at a chicken and waffle spot!?  If this service continues it will be just another boarded up building on the Avenue!  5 thumbs down"
7/10/2018,2 star rating,"Two stars for seriously horrible customer service... that alone will make me never return.. I came in alone, wanting to relax & eat before I had to adult for the day.. I waited 20 minutes before requesting a manager because not one server acknowledged my existence.. I get it, I'm white, wanting souldfood in Detroit.. my bad I guess.. but honestly being a server myself for 13+ years I didn't think I'd be treated that poorly. The manager finally took my order & I got to scarf down my lunch after an hour with the 10 min I had left.. the food was good but unfortunately the service sucked so I'll keep going else where until I find a soul food restaurant that doesn't treat me like I shouldn't be there"
2/19/2015,4 star rating,Great addition to the neighborhood. Love the chicken. I prefer the thicker waffles but these are good too. I look forward to seeing how this restaurant matures.
2/6/2018,1 star rating,The 4 times I have been there for carryout there has ALWAYS been food missing from my order. So no going back there anymore. To expensive to have food missing from my order. And to far to go back and get order right.
5/18/2018,1 star rating,"The manager on shift was very rude,  it took her almost 20 minutes just to take my order even though she passed me and looked me dead in the face several times. Then after placing my order and paying she walked away and after five minutes or so passed I asked for my change and the receipt,  after her giving me a very disrespectful and spiteful look, she rudely stated ""we don't give change"" and followed with saying ""it's only 16 cents, you really want me to waste my time getting you 16 cents,  matter a fact why don't you call Ron if you're really pressed over 16 cents"" I've been homeless before and every cent I have now I've worked hard for it and I don't look down on my change! It took 10 minutes of back and forth for her to finally give me my change. It saddens me because in the past I've promoted you all on my radio show, now I can truly recommend you all to anybody..."
5/10/2018,2 star rating,"A group of friends and myself went to Kuzzos after hearing great things. We had horrible service, waited about an hour for our food to come out, only to get soggy waffles and a cup full of oil with some macaroni and cheese in it. Also, the minute they brought our food they started stacking the chairs and shutting the place down. Not impressed"
7/18/2016,5 star rating,"BEST CHICKEN & RED VELVET WAFFLE EVER!!! I ordered the ""Big Red"" which consisted of a red velvet waffle, 3 chicken wings or tenders, and a side (mac n cheese), but I ordered an extra side of greens. When I say the chicken was seasoned down to the bone, and the waffle was so moist & fluffy... BELIEVE ME! The waffle comes with a scoop of cream cheese & bourbon syrup! YUMMY!!! The mac-n-cheese was really good, not too thick or dry. The greens tasted like something from my Grandmother's kitchen! Everything was good from beginning to end, food wise.The 1st time I went, the wait was lengthy & our server was unattentive and rude! But as soon as my food came out, all the troubles were forgotten. The 2nd time I went, I sat at the bar with no wait time,my waitress was much nicer and the food was STILL good! I love the casual ambience, and southern goodness.Will definitely be back to support and eat!"

3/25/2016,5 star rating,"Literally heaven in a box! (had a to-go order) The flavor and seasoning in ever bite was to die for. I had the Tender Love-a waffle and chicken tenders. It was delicious, service was great we had Tia and she did a really great job"
6/10/2016,4 star rating,"The food was delicious! The only reason this restaurant didn't get a 5 is because of the somewhat slow service. I order d the ""what up doe"" which is fried chicken and waffles with grits and eggs. I ordered my chicken crispy. The food was good. My fiancé ordered catfish, at the recommendation of waiter and it was the best!! The greens are also a must have! The 3 flavor kool aid in the huge mason jar was also good. Really sweet, but good flavor. Overall great experience. Nice decor inside. The restaurant wasn't super busy we still had to wait to be seated and wait for our waiter to bring us water for a while. When my fiancé didn't like his house potatoes, the waiter brought him another side with no hesitation. Overall great food! I will return and refer others."
8/13/2015,5 star rating,"I've been here twice so far and I have to say each time has been wonderful. I've gotten the same thing, the Big Red, which is a delectable red velvet waffle with bourbon maple syrup. My only complaint is that the wings need more batter. The batter tastes awesome and the wings are huge! I would definitely recommend it again and again!"
3/17/2016,3 star rating,"Our experiences with Kuzzos have been a seriously mixed bag. The food's terrific and, when there were just two of us, we had no problems getting a table or getting our food. When we went back with friends (four of us) a couple of weeks ago, we waited 30 minutes for a table and another 20 minutes to order once we were seated. We walked out after waiting an hour (an hour!) for our food. Our waitress was very apologetic--she said the kitchen can get the tickets mixed up when they're busy--but she kept telling us our food was almost ready with no basis for doing so. (She never went to the kitchen to find our ticket and move it to the front of the queue.) The manager also apologized, but really half-heartedly. I don't think he really cared.."

9/11/2017,2 star rating,"Food was mediocre tbh. It's a nice space but I found it cramped. The service I received was great but I heard it could have been better. I will not be back. I visited because I specifically wanted a black owned restaurant and breakfast and i was sorely disappointed.  I was home for a few days visiting my parents from out of town. Specifically, the chicken was fried so hard, it was hard to chew. It is overpriced for the quality."
3/4/2016,5 star rating,I had breakfast at kuzzos the food was amazing the service was excellent my food came out hot and very tasty. The food prices were very reasonable i recommend this restaurant to everyone it gets five stars.
5/14/2016,2 star rating,"Had breakfast there last week, service was okay, but the quality of the food was not good. When they first opened the portions were large and filling now they are skimpy, the Red Velvet waffle was so thin I could almost see through it and the cheese grits were lacking cheese. Too bad I thought I had found a good spot for breakfast. I have been here three time since December each time the quality has gone down and this last time has me saying I won't be going back!!!!!"
3/28/2015,4 star rating,"Went their for breakfast on a Tues. AM at 10:00 and it was packed. Got seated in about 5 min. (just 2 of us) and got coffee right away. Food was outstanding, server Yanni was top notch. I had sweet potato waffle and chicken tenders with 2 eggs scrambled as my side. Could only eat about half the food. Not healthy mind you but real good. One of the staff suggested I try the red velvet waffle next time."
10/15/2017,1 star rating,"I must say the food was Okay, but I believe they should hire people who are friendly and have basic customer service skills. When my fiance and I walk into the door on Oct 15th  2017 we notice two co-worker talking. SO we waited about 3 minutes until I said hello do we order here here and they said no u need to go over here. NO MATTER HOW BUSY A RETSAURANT IS, THEY  STILL SUPPOSE TO LET THE CUSTOMER KNOW THEIRS SOME  ATTENTION GIVEN TO THEM"
5/6/2015,3 star rating,"Solid chicken and waffles...I appreciate the Kool-Aid on the menu. Service could be better though, that would have gotten them an extra star."
10/6/2015,5 star rating,I can't even begin to explain how good kuzzo a is. The place is always packed but they do a great job of getting people in and out. Everyone should try kuzzos at least once !!
3/21/2019,3 star rating,Unfortunately it's just not an organized restaurant when we arrived 3 to 4 tables was waiting for there food. We had to asked for a waiter to just get some water and coffee. The waiter that came (she was nice) said that she is not our waitress but she would place our order. She took out drink order. When she finally came back (10 min) the coffee she brought was ice cold. She took our order and stated she will make a new pot of coffee. Clearly from observation they were short of staff and lacking customer training and knowledge. We got our food in a some what reasonable time actually before some of the other tables but the food was absolutely nothing to travel for this was my second time there and will be my absolutely last time. It's unfortunate that that is my outcome especially when l want them to succeed but l work to hard for my money to settle for below average service l pray that they will make it it's certainly a location that need them ...
7/5/2015,3 star rating,This restaurant would have more stars if they knew how to handle a big crowd. I went on a Sunday afternoon. Big mistake. You wait an hour to sit and then another hour for food that came cold and at different times for all the people sitting at your time. Most of the orders had something not added or wrong. The manager acted like it wasn't a big deal and I just inconvenienced him! The food is not super cheap so if I pay I want good HOT food! The food is good if it's done right. But do it right if you want people to come back!
7/4/2017,3 star rating,"Chicken & waffles are always good. Other breakfast sides are bland. Customer service sucks and every time we go we always end up sitting at the lone table by the front of the restaurant by the bar. Drinks are big, well-priced and pack a punch."
12/18/2017,5 star rating,"Great food. Had the Chicken (breast) & Waffles it was amazing. Someone that went with me got the Red Velvet Waffles with chicken tenders, I tried it it was so good I ended up going back the next morning to have the Red Velvet waffle and chicken tenders..."

2/25/2019,1 star rating,"We tried this establishment Kuzzos in Detroit on Livernois for the FIRST time this weekend. BEWARE OF  THE STAFF AND FOOD. We were seated within 5 mins HOWEVER it took almost 1 hour for anyone to come and bring us a menu. It took 30 mins just for someone to take our order. After 2hrs FINALLY receiving our food. Our chicken was EXTREMELY SALTY ( BEWARE), the waffles taste like something that teenagers could make at home. It was very bland NOTHING special about it. I suggest that instead of calling their name  Kuzzos Chicken and Waffles, that they just leave it Kuzzos. They never came to refill our water. My spouse ordered the main thing on the menu, and they finally brought the scrambled  eggs 30mins after the   eating the meal . I realize that they close at 9pm but if its 8:50pm and you are still accepting multiple patrons still coming to eat? Why did they TOTALLY TURN OFF THE HEAT AND MUSIC PLAYING. my spouse ordered a drink with the meal , so when the waitress came to give us the bill, my spouse questioned where was his drink? She replied  "" Did you want me to take off your drink on the bill? (((Birds chirping)))) YES YESS why should we pay for something that we didn't get? HORRIBLE HORRIBLE, if this place doesn't change the way they operate it wont last. Highly Disappointed."
1/26/2018,2 star rating,"Paid this place a visit today for my chicken and waffles fix.  However my schedule didn't allow time for dine in. I tried to call to place a carryout, never throughout to place an order.  I proceed there and was informed that they do not take orders over the phone. All is not lost so I place my order in person seems simple enough. I stood behind two gentlemen that placed their order as they were there before me.  After placing my order I along with the two prior orders that the wait would be approximately twenty minutes.  That's average so no big deal. However after an hour wait for all three of our orders I am completely disappointed.  I wouldn't have had to wait that long if they were able to take phone carry out.  Not to mention upon getting home the order was wrong!!!!!!!! I'm sorry but I'm truly considering not returning there again.  I have had very good service for dine in and the food is great. When in business be able to give your paying customers the excellent service we deserve.  I chose to patronize your establishment, please choose to treat me like you want me to return and I am appreciated."
7/24/2015,5 star rating,"Kuzzo is a very trendy, hip, and we'll decorated place. The staff was friendly, polite and the vibe was great on the Friday. The place is great for brunch, drinks, or just about anytime you want chicken and waffles. Definitely try the red velvet waffles, shrimp & grits, and have the ginger basil lemonade (bartenders were generous with their pour). Great addition to the neighborhood!!!"
6/19/2016,1 star rating,"I understand what it is like to be busy.  So, today is Fathers Day and we went to have a Fathers Day brunch.  We totally expected it to be busy and to have to wait.  Upon checking in with the Hostess and a gentleman (I assume was the manager since he gave the impression he was in charge) we were tolf it would be 1 hour.  Not unusual for here on Sunday and we love the food so we decided to wait.  2 hours later we were still outside in the heat.  However, the people who were 2-4 in size (there eere 6 of us) kept getting seats after seats instead of them having to wait like we did.  There were several instances they could have slid a 2 top and a 4 top together and seat us.  Also, there were a couple of groups who came in that appeared to be friends of the manager and were seated right away.  This is my issue.  3 cars parked in the chained lot next to the building and were seated immediately.  VIP's?  Not on Fathers Day Sunday in my mind.  At the very least they should have sent someone out with water for us people who were out there 2 hours on a 90 degree Fathers Day.  Poor service and poor management.  Get someone who knows how to manage and is fair to all."
3/13/2015,3 star rating,"With its popularity there is def a wait so expect that. However, once we were seated and had put it out orders, we watched as people who were seated after us got their food and we hadn't been given water. Our waitress never admitted this but she'd forgotten to put in our orders so we Waited an hour for food after waiting 45 to be seated. The food was very good! But the service was lacking majorly. There was no apology no amount taken off of our bill and no acceptance of responsibility. May give a second chance for the taste factor but debatable for service."
7/29/2018,1 star rating,"I came to order carry out and it took over 10 mins before I even saw the waitress come to the window. After I ordered, it took an hour to receive my food and I still was missing my sides! If I had not of prepaid I would of left! I watched 4 customers leave without ever ordering because she never came back to the window. I saw two Uber Eats orders canceled because the driver had been waiting longer than I had. This is absolutely absurd. I don't think this establishment is big enough nor accurately staffed to accommodate Uber Eats and walk in carry outs. Poor Shay was the only waitress assigned to bag and check all of the carry out orders. It's bad enough to have to wait over an hour to dine in but I don't believe any carry out experience should take this long. Especially because they do not take over the phone orders and you have to appear in person to place one. This reflects poor management and horrible customer service. I'll probably never frequent this establishment again."
4/5/2017,3 star rating,"Food was good! I like more seasoned fried chicken but the overall meal was a tasty combination. Service was slow, but our waitress probably had too many tables for one person. I would definitely recommend and go back to try another dish."
6/1/2015,5 star rating,"If you want a ""party in your mouth"" don't walk, RUN to Kuzzos.  They take things to the next level.  Order the Big Red....delicious.  Waffles and chicken both cooked to perfection...and the best wait staff I've ever seen.  You never need to ask for anything, they are always one step ahead.  My husband and I are visiting our daughter and we've been twice already and plan to go again.  Just cannot get enough of this place.  It is FAMILY OWNED, too, and it shows."

5/16/2015,3 star rating,"We arrived at 6pm. Our party was seated at 6:10. The order was taken shortly after being seated. Drinks came 5 min later and food came at 7:05. The food was good, but the cornbread was not. Wait time was long, so they need to work on that. Waffle was flat; however, the flavor was good. Being a chicken and waffle place the waffle needs to be outstanding. I would visit again in 6 to 12 months to see if service was good."
11/11/2017,2 star rating,"The service was great. I can't say the same about the food. I had Salomon Croquettes, Candied Yams, and rice and gravy. All of our food came back cold. My sister had macaroni and It was ""soupy"". The food overall just wasn't good"
2/23/2015,5 star rating,"Kuzzo's has a great atmosphere, great food and it has a fun concept.  I can appreciate businesses in the inner city of Detroit.  My food recommendation would be the sweet potato waffle, aka the ""Sweet Daddy,""  but I have also had the regular waffle and it was great.  The chicken is seasoned well and I will definitely be going back. You have to love new business in the heart of the city for Detroiters by Detroiters.  This is a must try restaurant and one that I will frequent."

6/24/2016,5 star rating,"Excellent greens.  My wife and I are from the south, and tried this place one day.  The chicken is well above average, but the greens are incredible.  Also, the fried green tomatoes are crispy and tasteful.  Additionally, I placed an order for pick up, and, while I waited, had some of the koolaid.  This was delicious, and took me back to growing up as a kid down south.  We will be back soon."
6/23/2016,1 star rating,"The ambience of Kuzzo's Chicken and Waffles is absolutely spectacular!!! First our waitress, a beautiful young lady by the named Najah, was attentive, fast with service, knowledgeable, and conscientious. I would say she was the best waitresses I have ever had. She was by far the best thing about our experience at Kuzzo's Chicken and Waffles. She had a super kind disposition and service oriented demeanor. After her, it goes down hill. I ordered the Big Mama ( 2 pieces of fried chicken, honey-buttered cornbread muffin, and cheesy-grits. The chicken was fried just right; perfectly crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. Unfortunately it contained enough salt to cause an instant stroke. The cornbread muffin would have been perfect had it been warm. The cheesy grits were quite ""soupy"" without evidence of any seasoning. I couldn't even taste the cheese. Oh yeah, I had a side of eggs too. They were not good at all. Now to the highlight of the meal. Before the food came I was brought a huge mason-jar of lemonade big enough to swim in. It was simply the best, and certainly the highlight of the brunch; aside from our waitress. There were so many people waiting for tables our waitress literally had to wade through a sea of people with our uncovered food. Ugh! If I ever crave good service, I would definitely go back. If I wanted really good food I would try somewhere else!"
3/11/2017,1 star rating,"Horrible customer service and the wait time is REDICULOUS! I've waited  2 hours for take out shrimp and grits. The girl taking the orders for take out has horrible attitude then forgot to put my order in! Even the customers was mad because everyone was getting their orders except me. And everyone saw it except the girl taking the orders The girl doing take out needs help she in the back packing upFood then taking people's order and every time she come back out to take another order it's like 30mins later. Stuff like this makes it hard to support BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES! It Ssooooooo disorganized and no one should have to wait that long to be seated or for take out! If you can avoid this establishment do so, unless you plan on spending three hours standing up waiting and staring at other people eat! Then they are soBusy you are packed in like sardines... very uncomfortable . Very poor customers service specifically the young black chick doing take out today 3/11/2017 at 11am. She needs to be FIRED! Very ghetto trifling service that are a disgrace to black women. Please don't waste your time going to this place! Believe me the BAD outweighs the good! The food is not all that and way over priced. The decor and Kool Aid is the best thing this restaurant has going, which says a lot. Please read all the bad reviews if you are contemplating this restaurant- ""EVERYTHING"" other people posted in regards to the negative reviews is TRUE!  From the front when you first walk in (short black chick screaming at the top of her lungs people's name and tableSize) to the servers running around like a chicken's with their head cut off busting tables (who can't help you) to the cold bland food that came out the kitchen. This place is horribleOn SOOOO MANY LEVELS BUT SPECIFICALLY SERVICE IS SLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWW AND ITS NOT A COMFORTABLE environment. Again I hate to put down my fellow black people DOWN that are trying to do something with themselves and better the community, but this is sad and an embarrassment. And just because this is a black establishment, we as black people shouldn't settle for this type of service and treatment. This is not ok for any establishment to function as this place does. Someone please call Gordon  Ramsay!"

6/9/2015,4 star rating,This was my first time eating here. Their prices were very reasonable. My boyfriend and I both ordered tenders and waffles. The food was really good. The only thing I didn't like was that their waffles were thin. The kool aid was really good as well. My server was very attentive and you could tell she liked working there. I'll definitely come back
5/31/2015,3 star rating,The food was great but the wait was ridiculous...over an hour to sit and 1.5hrs to get the food...so go if you are patient.
5/24/2015,1 star rating,"Although I can appreciate the former Lions owning and investing in the city, this says nothing about the overall dinning experience in this establishment. The wait time was absurdly long and definitely not worth the return visit. as compared to the New Center Eatery, the wait alone made me want to leave even while the food was prepared. And once the food arrived and tasted it I was even more disappointed that I didn't leave!!!I give this restaurant ten thumbs down."
5/13/2017,2 star rating,"I have gone to Kuzzos several times and have not had any issues. Today, the food was great but the service was disappointing. I planned to take my niece and sister for their 1st time for Mother's Day. I told the Hostess that there was going to be 3 of us but 2 (my sis and I) are here now. She said the whole party has to be present to be seated, I told them that Im not sure if my niece is coming or not...so we were seated. The Lead Server, Dionne comes to the table and says ""if your 3rd person comes, she'll be put on a Waiting List bc you suppose to wait until your whole party is here"". I did not understand the ""Waiting List"" since we were already sitting and the empty tables there, why couldn't she just join us at our table.  Dionne was very short in conversation and avoided eye contact with us as our Server. I did not feed into it like my Flesh wanted to..I remained nice externally. My niece never showed up. About 15 minutes later, an Caucasian couple comes in with two small children and mentioned they were waiting for more people. The couple stood around for about 10 minutes and was seated...about 10 minutes later 4 people walked in and joined them. Why were they treated differently? Why were we given a hard time and not them? So with the mistreatment and poor customer service, I asked for a manager and Beth, the Supervisor came out. I explained the scenario and she was empathetic and apologized..and said she would speak to the Lead Server Dionne.  Regardless of race/creed/etc, a paying customer is a customer, all customers should be treated equally.  Why were we given such attitude when 1 out of 3 people were missing vs 4 out of 8 people were missing?  At the end, Beth took $5 off the bill and Dionne came back and apologized..and was alot nicer suddenly. My sister and I encouraged Dionne to go somewhere alone and pray when she's overwhelmed because she cannot treat customers as she did. We told her that if she's having it bad at 8am, she has to pull it together bc it's going to be a busy stressful day and she don't want to lose more customers...like my sister and I. My sister said she'll never go back and I more than likely won't either."
1/23/2017,4 star rating,"My go-to for soul food. The portions are great, I always get the bam bam and highly recommend you get the side of candied yams. You can ask for your koolaid to be mixed with lemonade for an even better treat.

5/10/2017,1 star rating,This was my first time here at kuzzos and it will probably be my last and here is why. We were greeted by our waitress and we  ordered our food one person had not decided yet she placed the order she bought out our drinks and that was one of the last time seeing her the next time we even saw her again she was bringing our food which was cold never were we asked if thr food was ok or if we needed anything or if the other guest had decided on ehat he wanted to eat nothing. I can understand if they were crowded but it was 10am on a wed so there was no excuse for this poor service and there is never any excuse for cold food. Not to mention the bathrooms were a mess. Kool aid was good but that about it

5/3/2017,2 star rating,"I go to school down the street, UDM, and it was very inconvenient that they didn't accept orders over the phone. In other words I had to order in store, wait 25 mins for a grilled chicken sandwich, and a salad. Mind you when I got to class to eat my sandwich the chicken was completely dry and lacked the spicy mayo sauce that was suppose to be on the sandwich. Overall the service and food were not to my liking."
5/8/2016,1 star rating,"So after we finally being seated after an hour and a half it's like an additional hour and 20 minutes to receive our food. while we were waiting in our booth to receive our food we were solicited by gentleman trying to sell his CD, that was kind of uncomfortable considering we were there for Mother's Day brunch . Once our food came(I ordered steak and eggs) my steak was well done when it should've been medium my eggs never came my potatoes were plain even though I ordered smothered, my wife's eggs never came and the waffles resemble oversize Eggo waffles (they were flimsy and soggy and looked like they came out of the toaster). I complained to the manager for never receiving my steak or eggs and having our order wrong, the very apathetic manager comped our bill 50% after I told him I only wanted to pay for the food on the table, we did not consume any of the food so paid $25 for the food that was brought to the table because we just wanted to leave at that point. All in all I wasted $25 bucks, 3 hours of my time and a ruined Mother's Day brunch. Our experience was not unique as we were seated next to another family who was experiencing the same general issues."
4/26/2016,1 star rating,"My daughter and her family were in from out of town so we all decided to go out before she left. My husband and I had tried to patronize this restaurant on two other occasions but simply did not want to wait the hour to hour and a half that we were quoted. This time, we made an exception as it was a Sunday and we had the day free. I went in and put in our name, we had a party of 10, including 4 children under 7. Because of the kids, we decided it best for me to wait in the restaurant and the others would come when we got our table. There is almost NOWHERE for people to wait and we thought we were being pretty courteous by having most of our party wait outside instead of taking up the entire waiting area. I was told that it would be at least an hour and a half because there was a large party in front of us on the waiting list who hadn't been seated yet. Apparently they can accommodate a total of ONE large party at a time. No problem, again, we had all day. So... I position myself near the door around 4 feet from the host stand and proceed to pay EXTREMELY close attention to the hostesses as I do not dare miss them calling us. As it turns out after 2 hours of watching them grab menus, call names and seat people. Oh and also looking at me several times and saying something to each other which I can't hear because it is so loud in there, FINALLY the younger hostess who may have been less experienced comes over to me and asks have I been helped because (after 2 hours) she noticed I had been there a while. I remind her that I am the party of 10 ( which is down to 8 now because two people had to go to work). She goes back to the table (and I am watching ALL of this as I have been all along) and she comes back and says, she said she called you, referring to the older hostess. I said, well she did not so what are you going to do for me now? She continues to try and argue with me that they called me and now I have to act a slight fool. The girls sitting next to the host table chimed in, agreeing that no one indeed called me. So for starters, a blatant lie. Now, I see a group of table that can be put together to make an 8 top. I say, we will take that table , we will squeeze in if we have to. She proceeds to grab 8 menus and I cannot resist saying to her, ""Now see how you just counted out the 8 menus, yeah she NEVER did that. I watched the entire time I was waiting"" They push the tables together, I call my people and they are on their way into the restaurant from the parking (like a block away... ok, slight exaggeration but still pretty far). I go to the table and start to sit and the server says, ""Oh no, we can't seat you until your party is here""  Needless to say I say ""OOK, well I AM sitting"" and sit my butt down in the chair like, really??Now... we are sitting, grandson has a headache from hunger, I am furious still about being blatantly lied to as I have now figured out why they kept looking at me and talking to each other, no doubt commenting on the fact that my party wasn't inside, and I am thinking this better be THE most spectacular soul food I have ever had because, frankly I don't like chicken and waffles. I got the fried chicken, mac n cheese, and greens. Mac n cheese was bad, greens good, fried chicken BLAAND and WAY to large, which makes me feel like they are injected with solutions and raised in dark, feces laden cages. Daughter got shrimp and grits, super bland. Husband got chicken and waffles and was TOTALLY unimpressed. He typically gets chicken and waffles from another place in New Center, the actual best chicken and waffles according to most people we know. I ask for a manager and I am told by the server that she is the lead server but other than that, there is no manager there... on a SUNDAY! No offer to comp or even reduce our bill (party of 8 remember). A definite ONE. AND. DONE."

However the wait time was very Loooooooooong. They really have to figure out can way to get your food to you in less then 45 minutes."
3/12/2015,3 star rating,"The 3stars, However I give 5stars for the service, they certainly got that right. I love good old fashion buttermilk waffles and was disappointed not too have that. Not a fan of cinnamon so the touch of cinnamon to the waffle wasn't a hit with me. KUZZOS please make mention of the cinnamon waffles on your menu. Also the waffle was too thin and soft, I might as well had a pancake. Mac n cheese, Ive had better, a bit bland. Red Beans n' rice, a bit bland. Greens were good probably the best of my order, slightly bland though fine with me. Cornbread muffin dry & bland, the better part was the top and that was probably due to the butter. Overall the food was bland and this is coming from a person that has cut back on sugar & salts, Ive come customed to liking my food with minimal seasoning and sugars in her food. Yet this was too bland, flavorless, lacking something"
3/3/2017,4 star rating,"Kuzzo's is one of the better breakfast joints in the Detroit area. I find the grits a bit too soupy for my taste. That said, their awesome waffles, reasonable prices and their generally great service makes Kuzzo's worthy of a 5. The chicken is worthy of a 4.5 although I could enjoy them even more if they were slightly less salty.  If there was a way givng a rating of 4.5, I would. Still, four isn't bad."
10/13/2018,1 star rating,"came here after a long day of walking for the cure breast cancer walk w/ family and friends and of course we were starving! Some of my family had been here and recommended that we try kuzzos. The hostess advised 40min, we waited a hour to be seated. when it was time for us to be seated, which it was 11 of us, the hostess split us up and we sat at different tables, i understand she was trying to accommodate us, but when you go out to eat with ppl, the point of it is to enjoy the company you're with and SIT WITH THEM. For one, if the hostess knew we were going to be separated at seating, then the hostess should've warned us or gave us a longer time that way we could've made other arrangements. But after about 20min of sitting at our separate tables the hostess was nice enough to move us to a bigger table once it opened. We then had to wait a hour for the food to come out because the hostess advised the kitchen was ""backed up"". Terrible! Once the food came out it was hot, but the taste was not something to wait two hours for! The food was ehhh, it was ok, but not worth the wait. The atmosphere was amazing tho, loved the decor! Also, some of the servers had very nasty attitudes. Understandable, the establishment is busy, but the thing about working in customer service is that you have to learn patience and keep that attitude in the back where no customers can see it! In conclusion, the establishment is very small, so it seems like the employees need some coaching on how to work in a fast paced environment! Maybe i need to come when they first open in the morning or something to get a better experience, but this is not somewhere i need to go to again‍ this is one of those establishments that is just overrated, but i salute the hustle and the creator of the establishment. Sorry not sorry, but some of the employees are just slow. Need some training classes."
2/20/2017,5 star rating,Best chicken and waffles I've ever had. Red velvet waffle was outstanding and chicken was very crispy and flavorful.
2/10/2015,5 star rating,"Reading the other posts/reviews, it seems that the food is great but the staff are in serious and emergent need of PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS training. There are many people from both the inner city and surrounding suburbs who want to see this place thrive and grow. If customer service is lacking, the clientele will quickly dwindle and negative words will be spread to those contemplating a drive to the city to experience great food. Music isn't the only thing that takes someone to that next level when they succeed at ""crossing over."" Being born and bread in Detroit (what up doe cuzzo) but moving to the suburbs, I always miss and fiend for the food that only Detroit can offer and I always have to make the trip back to the hood to get my eat on, but others may not continue to do the same if they don't receive the service that they are accustomed to. The staff may be young and inexperienced but that is prime time to mold them into great ""people persons""  who exhibit excellent customer service skills that will not only help this business thrive and rise but also give the employees skills that will take THEM to the next level with whatever career choice path they go in.  I haven't actually been yet but planning to go really soon and will re-post then. Hopefully, I won't have any bad experiences with service regardless of food quality. Wait and see."
10/14/2016,5 star rating,"This time the waitress came right over and took my carryout order.  Yaaaa, I really was excited about that.  This restaurant has by far the best red velvet waffles I've tasted.   Gotta find a good recipe as I come a long way to get here.   The food is delicious.  The Kool Aid is gotta have, I'm  just lazy on that cause I make Great Kool Aid and I dont need an entire pitcher..lol.   The guests always seem to enjoy the food,  I've never seen anyone complaining."
9/10/2016,3 star rating,"I placed a carry out order,  you get better service when you dine instead of carrying out.  My second visit was not as good as the first,  and I'm guessing because I didn't dine in. I passed by about 8 staff, 1 spoke.   Food was good though. I had Big Red with scrambled eggs and grits. Oh yeah, and Kool Aid."
7/23/2016,5 star rating,"The food was amazing and the kool aid was awesome. I had the fried chicken, 3 sides and a muffin."
3/30/2015,3 star rating,"My only reason for giving it 3 stars rating because I was there this pass Sunday, this place is not the place if you have a party of more than 4 people.  I got there at 12:30 pm and waited almost 2 hours to be seated.  It was 5 of us.  However, in spite of the long wait after we were seated, the service was good and the food was ""very delicious!""  With that said, my only advice to the Owner(s) is focus seating your customers with parties more than four people quickly and efficiently not having them wait a very long time.  You will then definitely be five stars."
10/11/2015,5 star rating,The service the food the experience! Everyone was friendly and attentive!  Shanay was our waitress .. love her energy.. Wow she made all of our requests happen! Thank you for being so pleasant.  We will be back to see you when We are in town Kuzzo!

4/1/2016,3 star rating,"This is probably the most difficult review I've done because this place has good points and really bad points. I've been hearing really good things about this place and have been dying to try the food! To start, my party of three arrived at 5pm on a Friday. There was a decent amount of customers dining in, not packed though. It took us about 10 minutes to be acknowledged by the wait staff. We were then given menus. Our food orders were taken about 10 minutes after that along with drink orders. One person at my table received his drink (a Coke). My wife and I sat for about another 30 minutes waiting, and waiting. Right when we were about to leave, our food arrives but still no drinks for us 2! When we pointed out we still need our drinks, this guy in a suit who appeared to be a manager or owner decides to help the waitress bring us our drinks. At this point, we're content because the drinks are on the table and food is good but orders are still not complete, needing additional things we requested. The wait staff is nice but they seemed overworked. There are too many other employees standing around when they should clearly be helping to complete orders or something. Overall the food was good but all of our chicken seemed to be cooked in different batches (old, older, & partially fresh). Waffles were the star of the show by far! If I happen to go back, I'll be getting carryout just for the waffles with pecans. Tweaking a few things about this place could make this restaurant a force to be reckoned with. I hope the best for this place because I'd love to see a thriving business in Detroit rather than a failing one. Best of luck to you from here on out! Worth a try at least once. This was probably just a rare moment experienced by a customer of theirs, hopefully."
2/9/2017,3 star rating,"Visited for the first time on a Sunday afternoon/evening. Surprised that the wait was not long. Service was poor and food was just ok. Was expecting to be wowed based on all that I had heard and the reviews and I must say I was disappointed. When I expressed my disappointment my waitress told me they were doing the best they could they had been there all day. Food lacked seasoning and my kids make better waffles! Sorry to say but as far as Kuzzos goes, been there done that and won't be doing it again!"
6/25/2015,2 star rating,"We waited about 20 minutes to be seated. The entire time there are seats at the bar that were open. When the hostess called us to be seated, she asked if we wanted to sit at the bar.... Really!! Okay, I'll give you one pass because I heard the food was good. So we sit down... At the bar... The waitress takes our order.... We wait 40, yes 40 minutes for our food. The waitress comes out with a sad faceand proceeds to say the waffle machine is broken and there is only one working now.....really?!@&$#%. I came for the waffles and the sign on the door says chicken and waffles! So she says she can bring out our sides.... Thank GOD I order the shrimp and grits to take home, I had to eat that instead... And it was really good. The chicken strips were excellent, my friends said the greens and Mac and cheese were pretty tasty but it was supposed to be a package deal....I just don't think I can bring myself to go back again...it just not worth the aggravation. If you decided to go.... Make sure you eat first lol!!"
1/15/2017,5 star rating,"Such great food! The waffles have such a perfect flavor, and the biscuits & gravy are the best I've ever had. Yes, there was about a 30 minute wait, but it's worth it for the great food & service. I suggest coming earlier to avoid a wait."
3/12/2016,5 star rating,"tried this place for the first time on a whim, while looking for a chicken and waffles place in detroit.  it was AMAZING. the ambience is very trendy and vibrant, and the customers are all friendly and give the place a great vibe.  the food portions were insanely large, and great prices.  next time i'll try the red velvet cupcakes.  there was about a 40 minute wait for breakfast on a saturday morning, but it is well worth it, and i'd do it all over again.  can't wait to bring a group of friends with me next time!!!"
6/22/2016,2 star rating,"This place has potential but the service needs work. I visited in the morning during the week, the host were friendly, but it took a long time for a server to come to my table to greet me. Once the server finally came and took my order she never returned to see if I needed any thing else. I waited long as I could for her to return so that I could order a drink, and she never came so I walked to the bar to order a drink. The server never came back until she was bringing out my food order, not to mention this was a not a busy time. I would love to support the neighborhood businesses but the service needs work."
9/21/2016,5 star rating,"Wonderful lunch.  Had the chicken fingers, waffles, collard greens, mac n cheese.  It was delicious!  The staff was very friendly and very helpful and answered all our questions regarding the menu and our choices.  We had no problems with parking or crowds.  We went about 2 pm for lunch.  I'll be going there again."
2/5/2015,2 star rating,"The time to be seated was only 20 min. The came quick around 20 mins and afterwards i received my coffee, the chicken and waffle came swiming in grease they had to take it back to pour the grease from the chicken off my plate."
8/14/2016,5 star rating,Delicious and filling! Staff was quick and pleasant! Food delivery was with good timing. We will definitely go back.
9/19/2015,4 star rating,"GREAT fried chicken! Came here for dinner at 5 PM on a Saturday. We were told there would be a 30 minute wait but it ended up being less than five minutes. Be prepared because the service here is very slow. The servers are attentive enough but it takes the kitchen a long time to get the food out. I waited an additional 10 minutes for my shrimp and grits after my husband received his chicken and waffles which we'd waited quite awhile for already. The only odd thing I experienced here was that I handed a cash tip into our server and she just said ""oh"" and started talking to the table next to us.  The food was very, very good and we will definitely return. Parking is not great at all but we lucked out and were able to park near the edge of the lot off the alley."
7/1/2018,1 star rating,"I visited this past Saturday along with two other guests.  We ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer,  they came out too thick and very hard,  not cooked completely.  Then when it was time to order our meal,  we were told they were out of yams and cornbread. The waitress said we could wait for cornbread but it will be a while because the cook had to go next door to find the recipe or we can have toast because they were out of biscuits too.  We ordered our food and when it came out the chicken breast was dry,  the greens were full of stems which made up of half the bowl,  and they gave us half bowls of corn because they ran out, then under cooked crunchy rice.  When time to leave they gave us a small plastic pie container and some small bowls to put our food in because they ran out of carry out containers.  I was totally disappointed with this visit and will not be going back.  The waitress did the best she could but the manager and the cook were acting as if it was nothing and was not trying to accommodate us for the 3 hours of a horrible experience."
2/9/2015,5 star rating,"Great food and atmosphere! I will be going here quite often. I've been three times already. Great waffles, chicken, shrimp and grits, yams, mac&cheese... I can go on. This place will be around for a long time."
5/31/2016,1 star rating,"THIS PLACE IS  IS TERRIBLE. 1. Princess took forever to greet our table. 2. My ""medium steak"" was well done. I was never asked about the temperature. 3. Who kept giving Princess tables! She couldn't keep up! Tables came in after us and left before us. 4. My friends plate was dirty and the manager( I hate that I can't remember his name) said, ""it's not dirty it's just the color from the red velvet before hand that touched it"". My friends plate had a deeply in crusted red particle that the busy dishwasher simply missed and both the expo and head plating chef missed. My friend was halfway through her meal when she noticed and it was a disgusting sight. 5. The Caesar salad took 20 minutes. The romaine seemed frozen, the tomato was old, and once again the bowl was dirty. 6. A $10 gift card is not needed. Kuzzo's needs to temporarily shut down and find new management for the front of house as well as a head kitchen manager. 7. Oh! The bartender or server didn't know what a vodka- soda was. No star yet, maybe a piece of coal."
5/11/2016,4 star rating,"The chicken was hot and juicy and the waffle, made with cinnamon, was thin but delicious! We visited the restaurant about 10 am on Wednesday. The service was good but we felt the waitress forgot about us at times. Took about 25 minutes to get our food. Overall it was a good first visit with great food. Will definitely return."
4/30/2016,3 star rating,"My first time here and yes, wait was long but that's typical of a place that receives a lot of buzz...so hopefully they have plans to expand.  The food was just okay.  I had collards, yams, mac & cheese, cornbread, chicken, lemonade and a taste of the plain waffle.   The waffle was not bad...it just had an acquired taste that I didn't care for.  There was an after taste w/o any toppings.  Lemonade was way too sweet...had to add water.  Cornbread was just bland.  The mac & cheese was almost there however it could probably use more cheese to bind the noodles together.  I would go back for collards and yams but its not serious enough for me to wait on a long list."
8/11/2015,3 star rating,"I went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  The wait was tolerable, the service was not.  The food was exceptional.  I had the Tweetie bird (wings and waffle).  The waffle was so good it almost didn't need syrup.  The wings were large, crispy and had great flavor.  We also ordered the fried green tomatoes.  They were quite delicious and the remoulade was tasty.  It took well over 10 minutes for a server to even approach our table and that was to say she would be right back.  It really shouldn't take that long to take drink orders.  The server was friendly and really not sure what the situation was that day as it did not appear to be overly crowded for the servers that were available.  Had the service been better, they definitely would have received more stars from me.  However, this will not stop me from going back.  The food was great and deserves a return visit.  Maybe a carryout will be better."
10/12/2015,4 star rating,"The food here was delicious!  I had the chicken and waffles and it was so good!  The waffles (not Belgian) are served with warm syrup and lots of butter - who wouldn't be happy?  My sister ordered the 3 pce chicken and waffles and  a shrimp and grits - serving sizes were huge, so she had plenty to take home.  Our only thing was that we were a party of 8 - our bad, we should have made a reservation.  There was only 1 table to seat that many and people eat very leisurely there! We pointed out that we would be willing to separate our party to 2 separate but close tables, so it worked fine.  Service was good and staff was really friendly.  We will return and they have carry out too!"
3/25/2016,1 star rating,"The wait is horrendous, but that's understandable because the food is pretty good, but the service is the definition of horrible. Dionne served my friends and I and let me just say, NEVER AGAIN. Not only did she serve my food to another table, but when I did get my order, it wasn't even complete. Then when she gave me my change, she slid it to me across a wet table. She also took forever to take our payment for the bill in the first place and also slammed other people's beverages on our table. Maybe today wasn't her day but something needs to change."
4/13/2016,2 star rating,This was not the worst but definitely not the best food. The Mac & Cheese was disappointing. The chicken was like it had been waiting to long under the light warmer; the waffles were good and the Kool-Aid. This for me was more so a place to try due to people saying the food was so good. I don't have to return here anymore. It was just ok for myself and the people I was with.
1/17/2016,5 star rating,"My husband and I ate at Kuzzo's for the first time today and I was extremely SATISFIED with both the food and the customer service.  I ordered the Trey-Deuce (3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles) and my husband ordered the What Up Doe (same as mine plus eggs and grits).  The food came out hot and pretty fast considering they were very busy when we went, we did not have to wait to be seated though.  The waffles were very delicious, the best waffles I have eaten in the metro Detroit area, they put the pancake houses to shame in my opinion.  Tia was my server she was friendly and professional, she made my visit very pleasant and comfortable.  I would definitely RECOMMEND KUZZO'S and I will definitely be a regular customer."
1/14/2016,5 star rating,"Went on a Wednesday night with our daughter and several of her friends to celebrate her birthday.

7/12/2015,4 star rating,I got carry out i tried calling the number listed at least 12 times and it remained busy I even found what they called the carry out number on Instagram and it just continued to ring with no answer. The food was great though but the service was kinda bad
7/12/2015,5 star rating,"Good Food is Worth the Wait. I've concluded that if a restaurant doesn't have a wait, especially on the weekend, it's more than likely laking a major element. Kuzzo's lives up to the hype. I can tell the food is fresh, none of that frozen crap, which would explain the extended wait times. However, I'm good with giving extra time in exchange for quality. The chicken and waffles are amazing!! Beware you will probably get the itis after eating, but what do you expect when you're consuming good ole fashion soul food. I enjoyed my experience at Kuzzos and would recommend others try this Detroit treasure. I'll definitely be back!!"
7/12/2015,4 star rating,Their service has gotten better since it's opening. More efficient. From giving our name to paying our tab was a hour. Well done.
8/9/2015,2 star rating,"The food is just ok. I got the chicken (on bone), 2 waffles, eggs, and cheese grits. None of my meal was really that good. I've had way better chicken and waffles in Detroit and outside of Detroit. The chicken reminded me of a home made order of KFC Original. The breading on the skin was thin and not crispy. I went late so the chicken may have not been made fresh (just an assumption). I thought the waffle would  be good due to the great aroma of cinnamon that hit me once the plate was sat in front of me. But at first taste the waffle was just alright. The eggs and grits didnt do much either. The interior is nice and service is friendly. Their specialty drinks are off the chain (and I'm not one to like sweet cocktails)!. Our bar tender, Dominique, did her thing as well! She made sure the experience was on pointe!- If you do Chicken and Waffles, make sure that those two items are done exceptionally well or you just shouldn't do it! Hopefully this is taken as constructive criticism because I do want to see them successful. They have all the right qualities, they just need that extra humph to get their food to the right level."

6/7/2015,2 star rating,"First timer. Told by others that food was good. Came on a Sunday with a party of 12 after HS graduation.  Hostess was friendly. Told wait would be about 45 min. Benches outside to wait. Noticed other customers standing and waiting. Our wait to be seated was 2 hours. Waitress (Yanni) was the BEST, she handled our  group with a smile. Took another 45 min-1 hr for food. All orders were correct.. Seasoning on chicken was non-existent. One order sent back because chicken wings were not done. Fried tomatoes were too hard, inedible. Waitress removed charge. Eggs sent back x 2, incorrectly cooked. Wished owner would have stopped by table for comments. I will return to give place one more try. Added note: BEWARE... we parked in (closed) cleaners lot. Scammer said he owned lot and we owed him $4 for parking."
3/14/2015,3 star rating,"Well  well wel.  I learned of this restaurant  thru a local news paper and the  BLAC publication..   My BFF birthday; great lets go.  Put name on list  wait one hour however our name was called in about 30 minutes.    Waiter came and nothing else for a long time.  Then our server came and took our order.  After 45 minutes waiting on  the order to come I became upset and  a wee bit inpatience. I began to  ask anyone that came by,  Where is our order!    Finally  two of the  three orders came they came imcomplete , you guest it  not mine.   This part really  gave me  question if I came to the right place to celebrate my BFF birthday.  A gentleman came to our table and ask  d id any one at this table order ..... I said yes I did.  Before he left we advised him that the two people that  we had received their order had  no fork ,  knife or napkin .  His reply was I'll take care of that right away then he walked away.  I have yet to see him!   When my order came  it  was a bit chared the sides were good.  The only item that I really enjoyed was the corn muffin.To wait 2 hours  in an establishment that deals Chicken  and waffles  is a bit much.  As most items  on the memu have been prepreparied..They do have a carry out ,however  they do not have an area for customers to wait for the order.  The  table that we were seated was in that area.  To  deal with the waiting of the food and having to deal with butts and legs and childrend   and the high volume of noise almost became too much. This place  may work however much improvement  must be made."
10/17/2015,3 star rating,"My boyfriend and I drove from Canada to check out Kuzzos, when we arrived it was extremely busy which is a sign of good food to me!  It was just the two of us so we were seated right away, unfortunately the table we were given was tucked away in the corner right beside the waiting area. It was hard for me to enjoy my meal with a man waiting for a table standing directly behind me breathing down my back. We also had a couple stand directly in front of our table as if we weren't even there.  The food was decent, the waffle had a great flavour but it was extremely soggy, not crisp like I had hoped.  The chicken tenders and mac & cheese were very good!  The music was so loud I could hardly hear my boyfriend or the waitress, everyone around us had to yell to talk making it even more louder.  The service was pretty good we were in and out in a bout an hour.  We had an overall okay experience, the food was good, I would stop by again if I was in the area but wouldn't go out of my way."
3/28/2015,3 star rating,"Heard about the buzz on face book  and from friends. My daughter and I went during mid morning and were seated fairly quick. The food was delicious and timely. The service however was terrible. To be fair, we went on two different occasions and both times at non peak hours and found the same experience. The servers appears either to be poorly trained or they simply don't care. They are not rude, they just lack attentive responses or follow through with the customer. I  so want business like this to succeed in the city, but all elements of restaurateur has to be in place to be successful. The lack of quality service ruin the experience for me."
