3.5 star rating,"I held my birthday brunch here on New Years Eve and it was AMAZING!! The service, food and drinks were all top notch! Q was our waitress and did a FABULOUS job. I will personally request her next time. She was attentive, courtesy, fun and sweet!! She was on top of all our requests and refills! THE BUFFET was so delicious! Wings, fried fish, crab cakes, bacon, sausage, cheese and regular grits, omelette station, fruit, pasta station, pancakes, sweet potato and reg hash. The list goes on, they have the best pancakes ever!!! Perfect texture and sweetness!! Their mimosas OMG; peach and strawberry sooooo yummy!! I cannot wait to eat here again!!  Such a delicious restaurant. I encourage a large sign on the building as we had to look hard for the sign leaving on the building. It would definitely draw more traffic!!!"
5 star rating,They are closed every time I try to go. Nothing is updated saying they are closed. The phone number does not work
1 star rating,"I stumbled upon this place while staying not far away for a conference. As I was walking up to the building, which is right next to a dilapidated building and down the street from construction, I at first thought this place had closed and almost turned around. But it lies inside up an interesting elevator on the third floor. It was a weekend, and they only offered their unlimited brunch menu for $25, which was a steal compared to back home in DC. There were several different stations for omelettes, pancakes, entrees, and a dessert bar. Their menu is decidedly southern, although I think it needs some work...Highlights and lowlights: -Eggs (scrambles): Meh. They tasted a bit off to me, so I didn't get more than a few bites in-Mac n cheese: Actively not good. This made me very sad, as I am a Big Mac and cheese fan -Chicken wings: These were pretty good. -Grits: They totally tasted off. I took one bite and that was it. The service was friendly and the place had a nice vibe with music in the background, but I honestly couldn't recommend it based on the food."
2 star rating,"Sorry, but it is not open now. Someone did open the locked door to tell us it was closed because of staffing shortages. He hoped to open again soon."
1 star rating,I want to love this place but definitely need some adjustments made to be charge buffet on Sat/Sun at a price of $24 per person.  Lets start off with the positive areas that I enjoyed:- the DJ was SUPER lit; I don't know who he was but keep him (PERIOD)- free parking- food line wasn't too bad; there is a wait since it's made to order.- bacon was on point (it's the simple things)Ok let's get to the improvement areas.... - Servers needs to WRITE stuff down for everything- Why do I need to keep asking for water?! Pitchers do exist instead of brining those tiny bottles or give our table several bottles.- Why wasn't there utensils on the tables - even after they told us we can go eat?  (Come on now)- Waiting area need to be builtThe food wasn't bad at all but not for a value of $24 (maybe $15) and on top of the that drinks were high; basically $10 and up for anything.  Oh beware if you and your party are seat next to the signage - everyone will want take pictures which I was happy the people who did sit there was super nice about it.  They had to stop eating or move their chairs because groups wanted to take pictures.This place has hope and I wish them the best - in hopes for change.Happy Eating!!!
2 star rating,"Let me start by saying,  the staff was super friendly and welcoming and the loft is really nice and cozy.  My friend and I went there on the weekend and I knew it was only the brunch buffet available... However I didn't know the price before arriving here.... $24.99/person... WAAAAYYY over priced they had a lot of options made to order omlets and pancakes but the buffet had some staples scrambled eggs biscuits and some soul food it was okay but not worth $24.99.  Then We ordered orange juice and this was clearly not fresh squeezed but cost $2.50 for an 8 oz glass and no refills.  It would have been nice if we could have ordered from a menu instead especially for that price.  I would have liked waffles but they only offered eggs and pancakes for a main breakfast dish.Then at the end of our visit our waitress asked if we had any feedback for anything that we would change and when my friend gave his input that a larger glass for the price they charge, she was like really? And totally dismissed his feedback."
3 star rating,"Weekend brunch review - since this place is new, it seems they are struggling with consistent service, timing, and how to exploit their beautiful view, and even with all of that, it's still great! We've been to The Breakfast Loft twice for their weekend brunch. The first time out party of two shared a large booth. We started off with delicious cocktails. I loved the Henny Tea. Because it wasn't so busy, we relaxed for quite some time before dipping into the breakfast buffet, and those cocktails slipped up on us a bit. They're the kind that taste light and refreshing while packing a powerful punch! The buffet was well stocked with a strong soul food breakfast. French toast casserole, waffles, fried chicken, catfish, grits and hash - each two ways, green beans, and plenty of breakfast meats. On another table, there were fruits, salads, pastries, and dessert. The food was great! I was curious how it would be with such an amount of food sitting out like that, but they kept it well-stocked and piping hot without getting soggy. I'm not much into breakfast sweets, but the French toast casserole with just an added bit of maple syrup was delicious. I loved the green beans and the hash with sweet potatoes. All the other food was good, and there is just so much of it. And while sweets aren't usually what I go crazy for, I loved their banana pudding. It was super sweet, silky smooth, and had just a tiny crunch from vanilla cookies. The second time we went we had a larger group, and though the restaurant was a bit busier, it definitely wasn't busy. Our service was a bit lacking, just inconsistent timing and lack of attention for water filling and when we were ready for the check. The drinks and food were still great, though I missed that banana pudding and didn't find the peach cobbler quite as good. On the second visit I realized what would make this a five-star place for me: more vegetables and fresh fruits. I can't eat all those carbs! I would love to see a scramble with mushrooms, peppers, onions, or even just a side of them, maybe another hot vegetable dish, too. There is also a lack of alternative meats. All of them were pork-based. I'm not looking for vegetarian sausage, but maybe a chicken or turkey one. I'd also love a bit more fresh fruit to balance out the plate. Still and yet, we'll be back. I love the vibe, especially for two people, and I like that Henny Tea for breakfast. The location also makes a walk in the river front an easy way to walk off some of the guilt from all that good food!"
4 star rating,"Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try on a weekend. On weekends, they are buffet only so you can't order off the regular menu. Their buffet offers a lot of soul food options: fried chicken, grits, a couple different potato options, French toast casserole, Mac and cheese, Cajun pasta, fruits and so on. They also have an omelette bar where you can pick your ingredients and have an omelette made for you, as well as made to order pancakes. There was also a pastry table where you could get breakfast pastries. There is certainly no shortage of options. The food itself was... ok. It wasn't bad by any means but of the various dishes I tried, I wasn't really blown away by anything. The space itself is really nice, you get a nice view of the river and the inside is well designed/decorated. The service was great and the staff was super friendly. I would be interested to come back during the week to try their breakfast menu, but as far as the buffet goes I wasn't super impressed."
3 star rating,"Do not come hungry. Even in a virtually empty restaurant, you will be treated cavalierly by an unengaged waitstaff. You will have to beg for water when there is only one other occupied table. You will be privy to the least urgent people known to man. When I was there, there were three people manning an empty bar, one person serving customers I believe the waitstaff gets on a pack mule to travel to Colombia and pick the coffee beans themselves. At least that's what it felt like while I waited for coffee.Make sure you ask for syrup for your pancakes. The request will be treated as some sort of odd ""extra"". The menu says 3 pancakes and they gave me 2. For what it's worth, the food is good."
3 star rating,"This place is awesome! It's very new and service is top tier. The food was veryyyy very good and drinks were just as good. I had the vegan skillet which was very tasty. They have a few other vegan options (which includes egg substitute) as well. The owner is veryyyyy nice. Came out to speak on us and check on us to make sure everything was nice. It's a black owned breakfast spot in Detroit which added to my appreciation of the establishment.I love the venue, it's very cute for pictures. Not overly trendy so it's appropriate for all ages. Literally perfect. I was served by Lucas and he took the experience over the top. This place is my new spot for brunch Also, if you need a place for a brunch date THIS IS IT."
3.5 star rating,I like the location. The loft has only been opened for a week. The server was helpful and made suggestions about the menu. I ordered the omg french toast(topped with blueberries)  with eggs. It was good I thought It was going to be different kinds of berries. The owner came to my table to introduce herself. She seemed nice and professional. I look forward to coming here again.
5 star rating,"I was just checking this restaurant downstairs and saw a sign by the elevator Brunch upstairs on third floor. I'm just going to sum it up like my group shared. You heard of the song ""Stair way to heaven"" they just built an elevator for it. And there was a real guardian angel that took us up. I needed reservation and the angel made it happen. Family run and they made it the best experience ever in our life. Great staff flying around like butterflies. Thank you Micah for the key to heaven. God bless""May God grant you the desires of your heart and make all your plans succeed"" Psalms"
5 star rating,Perhaps the most awful restaurant I've dined at since moving to Detroit. Poor servicePoor explanation before being seated$25 brunch - not a single offering a la carte No decent vegetarian optionsLimited to 90min seating (we had 6 guests)Automatic 18% gratuity on crappy serviceBeverages (coffee!!) are $2.50 p/  w cups - not included with serviceStaff is bothersomeFood was mediocreMusic was incredibly too loudNot impressed.None of us will be back or return.How is this place staying open?!?
1 star rating,God is good. I love how he provides adventures. The food was fabulous however the owners and staff were even better! They light up when complimented which is so easy with their grand smiles while caring for their new friends. We even had a view of the water!
5 star rating,"First and foremost, the building doesn't look inhabited from the outside and there's nothing that says The Breakfast Loft is nestled nicely on the 3rd floor of what looks like an abandoned building. Fight the urge to turn around and take a chance on them, you'll be pleasantly pleased that you did. We arrived a little bit before they opened but they accommodated us and gave us a table. They were a little slow in setting up and food wasn't available until almost a half hour after they opened but the food was worth the wait!Saturday's and Sunday's they do a full Breakfast Buffet. They have a pretty good selection of breakfast foods from Biscuits and two types of gravy, crispy bacon, sautéed shrimp, scrambled eggs, fish, fried chicken, green beans, crab cakes, fruit salad, regular salaand small pastries. There was also an omelet station with a great selection of add ins as well as a Pancake Station with some of the thickest, sweet tasting pancakes I've ever had!!Would be nice to see this area of Detroit get its legs back and be redeveloped, but nice to see a restaurant taking a chance on location to bring the area some delicious food!! Can't give it 5 stars unfortunately. The Men's Bathroom was a little sketchy, needs some updating and attention and service got a little slow once they started getting busy. Not much of an issue when you're getting your own food."

4 star rating,They had a wide selection of delicious food on the brunch buffet. The birthday pancakes are a nice touch if you are celebrating your birthday. Great service. The staff was very helpful.
5 star rating,"Great service, amazing food and officially my new Detroit breakfast spot. Parking is easy to find and there is a parking lot right across the street.I had the Shrimp and Gritz... amazing, tried the pancakes with caramelized pecans and those were good as well. This is a new restaurent and the owner was nice enough to stop by and have a conversation with us."
5 star rating,I decided to try the Breakfast Loft for my 40th birthday because I love to support small business but this was horrible. The waitress never came back to our table when she did she brought the bills and they were wrong. She never brought back $9.00 worth of change for one of my guest. We were already charged gratuity and she said she had to find change. She over charged another customer $8.00 and blamed it on the computer system. They definitely need to get there systems in order and better customer service. Don't think I will be attending again. Also if you use a credit card it's an additional charge but they don't tell you that
2 star rating,Cute lil spot for good breakfast and mimosas.  Omelette was outstanding as well as the fish n grits!!! I would definitely revisit.
5 star rating,"first - the food was alright. the corned beef hash had way too much potato and not enough meat- also forgot one of the eggs. the service however, was horrible. the waitress dropped waters and then walked away without asking if we needed anything or had any questions. i don't even think she mentioned her name. after we told her we were ready to order she said okay then walked away and helped another table before coming to us. she never asked about the meal or even refill waters once. we were sitting, waiting for our bill and she was busy talking with her co worker- not engaging with any of her tables. we had to go up to the bar to ask for her and ourr bill because we ended up waiting for such a long time. she finally dropped the bill and didn't say anything just walked away. the worst part was she gave us attitude every time. as a server myself and a customer it was very frustrating and surprising to have had this experience. would not recommend this place to anyone and definitely won't be returning."
3.5 star rating,"Think I found my new go to downtown, happy I gave this place a try and the Sunday brunch is DEFINITELY LIT! The regular menu has go to be my favorite though!"
5 star rating,"Came here for my birthday, with some friends for Sunday brunch. I wanted more lunch food, than breakfast, so I felt it was lacking that. Salad, chicken,seemed to be the only lunch option. They have an omelet station, and quite of few breakfast options. However, I did not like how I had to ask for condiments for my meal several times: ketchup, butter, jam. I feel like these should be out near near  the food, or faster service when delivering  to  the table."
3 star rating,"My group and I were in Detroit for a convention.  We  were so hungry and were driving around trying to find food. We found this family owned uplifting, beautiful place. The food is delicious and extraordinarily satisfying. The lovely family made us feel at home and we felt like part of the family.Now I know where to eat when in Detroit!"
5 star rating,"I went here a couple months ago. I wanted to try it out because it's a black owned business and I love to support but I was kind of disappointed. Nothing special about the place. I went on a non busy day.. my waitress was average.. food took way too long for there to only be two tables in the restaurant, us included.. I just wasn't impressed."
3 star rating,"Love! Love! The Sunday Brunch offered great mimosas, nice buffet variety, and pleasant service. The added bonus was the R&B music selection by the great DJ."
5 star rating,"The Breakfast Loft is definitely going to be one of my new fav's. Our food was absolutely delicious, parking was a breeze due to the lot across the street and our waiter Lucas delivered superb service. Not to mention a very calm ambiance. This establishment is definitely a hidden gem. Thanks for the great experience."
5 star rating,"Go to this place only if you want them to charge your credit card incorrectly and hope you don't notice. I called and they offered no willingness to correct  the charge. Also, food was bad, the place was completely mismanaged and the wait staff was rude. In fact, the waitress welcomed herself to sit at our table and lecture us about rules. The rule includes that we only sit there for a limited time. The brunch is $25 a person and they treat you like a loitering homeless person at a soup kitchen. Only go here if you want to leave angry."
1 star rating,"Went here for an impromptu weekday breakfast-for-lunch kind of day. Not very crowded given the time of day but that gave us a great view of the space, which is expansive and nicely decorated with plenty of seating. I had the Mediterranean omelette and a side salad with raspberry vinaigrette and my friend had a vegan burrito with tofu. We both were happy with our meals, yummy flavors and fresh ingredients. Will definitely have to come back on a weekend to check out the brunch buffet, and the mimosas! The parking lot across the street was super convenient and although initially not sure where to go once we we entered the building, we quickly discovered the elevator with a sign to go the third floor."
4 star rating,"We were excited to try out the Breakfast Loft and unfortunately we left very underwhelmed.  First- they need to get signage.  There is nothing indicating you are in the right spot.  Second- we got into the elevator and there was a chicken bone on the floor that has been there since the night before.  A clean establishment is critical! We were greeted and seated immediately. We were only the second table in the restaurant.  When seated an employee was standing across from our table and very loudly stated why would you seat them at that table.  She then continued to stand there and just stare at us.  She made us very uncomfortable.  Finally a younger guy came up to wait on us and explained they only had a buffet for the morning and explained half was set up in the second floor and half in the third floor.  We ordered mimosas and headed downstairs.  When we walked down there, there were two female employees standing talking.  Never acknowledged us until I asked where the food was set up.  They said ""oh we haven't set it up yet- give us 20 minutes"".  Then they continued to stand there making no effort to set up the buffet.  It was 10:30 and brunch was listed in Yelp as starting at 10am.  We walked back upstairs and said we would have the mimosas and go. No one asked what happened and why we wanted to leave. No apology or concern about why they had customers walking out- again they only had 2 tables (us being one of the tables).  We love supporting new business in Detroit but unfortunately I won't be back as they made it apparent they didn't want customers.  There were probably over 12 employees standing around making no effort to set up the buffet or clean or wait on customers. Many of the employees need serious training for this place to be a success."
2 star rating,Great customer service and good people work there the only problem I had was they didn't let me know about an automatic tip charge when you pay with your card my bill was 76 but I was charged 84 that's something they should explain before taking someone's  card or post it on the receipt
3.5 star rating,"Great staff, great food. Upscale with a chill vibe m. A Detroit must. Great view off the water as well."
5 star rating,"I love the interior and food. We have whole day at work and able to relax in the breakfast loft. The host is amazing. We have such a great time, I will definitely come back again"
5 star rating,"I wish I could give this place a zero! NO STARS AT ALL! First there's no signage, none at all, second the heat was on hell, like literally the waitress said she was cold so she turned the heat up (so what about the sweating customers?). Third the menus were filthy, sticky, hair was stuck to them, and they were stuck together, it was just nasty. 4th the cook was rude and decided to curse loudly (mind you it was just me, my two female friends and my baby) and he cursed at the waitress and said ""I'm not fucking doing this shit, find someone else"" and then he walked out. 5th after all of that the cook was clearly high off some type of drug, he looked dirty and unkept. 6th the MOD came over to apologize and said he'll get him to come back.... no at this point we just gonna go because he's disrespectful, dirty, and I don't want to keep my child here nor dO I want his nasty self cooking my food. 7th the manager tried to charge us for our drinks!!!??? Are you kidding me? I'm not paying for anything and we will not be back. 8th the cook was  standing outside smoking a cigarette, waiting for us to leave, then he  walked right back inside, so I felt like he just didn't want to cook for black ppl. Again, there was no other customers there. We won't be back and I'm still going to call the owner because that was unavailable and unacceptable. I want an apology."
1 star rating,"I was happy to find a place that took reservations for brunch. I called and was informed they have a breakfast buffet and DJ. I was thinking more along the lines of a breakfast buffet in DC. The concept is good but everything is poorly executed as far as the food, drinks, and service. I would not return. Instead I would order carry-out at Hudson's for better tasting and overall quality of breakfast."
1 star rating,"This was my first time here at the breakfast loft. They do buffet style brunch on Saturdays and it's 25/ person which is not a bad price. Tons of options and the food is good! I would appreciate if there were menus or at least signage stating pricing. The service was out of this world. Talked to so many people and our server, Kristen was awesome! If you want a relaxed brunch environment with tons of food, great view of of the river/ CAN, drinks and bumping music check this place out"
5 star rating,"Great time. DJ, omelet station, shrimp and grits station. Great view of the river; service excellent!"
5 star rating,"It is a nice attribute to down town Detroit. We went on a Sunday it was all you can eat brunch buffet. It was $23 or $25 per person. We (my husband and I) also got the mimosa 1liter container for $20 and it got us both about 3 glasses a piece. Why I Love was that there was. Large variety of food. I don't eat pork and they had my favorite turkey bacon, also chicken, and fish. And a full array of pastries and salads. They also had a omelette station I took some of the turkey bacon over to make mine. I didn't like that I was charged an extra $10 without being advised luckily I got the notification right than and I asked them. The owner came over and explained and I was fine with it but just wish I would have been warned well in advance like before ordering, they say it's a fraud protection hold and it's released with in 24 hours which is not true it takes longer so they need to get a better understanding cause it's based on how much your bill is so it could be higher and may cause a problem when it's a larger party so you may want to pay cash. Also I wish they would have had labels in front of the food because somethings I didn't get because I didn't know what it was. But overall it's a nice place they are still working out the kinks because it's only been open a month but I would recommend."
5 star rating,"Was excited to come here for their Saturday brunch buffet. Left disappointed. It's a great space, and the service was friendly and attentive, but the food was just average at best. For $25 per person, I expect a lot more than luke warm plain scrambled eggs and a waffle station. There was no omelette station, no sauces for the overly breaded fish, no sausage gravy for the biscuits. At half the price I would have been ok with it, but at this price I expect a lot more."
2 star rating,This place was outstanding!! The Mimosas was great!! The steak and eggs were the best!! We tried the Salmon crokets and those were great too!! Give this place a try!!
5 star rating,"I loved my experience here. Great mimosas, french toast, and bacon! Our waiter, Lucas, was so friendly, helpful, informative, and all around amazing. Great brunch spot!"
3.5 star rating,"I called on a Wednesday to make a reservation for a Saturday for me and my wife's 24th Wedding Anniversary and was treated extremely poorly by the host who answered the phone and  possibly the owner who never sent me an email to confirm my 12:00 reservation. I called multiple times and was told the ""owner"" was away and would review if there was a spot for 2 people. Why wouldn't the host know? I suspect that either it was due to my name first name that they didn't  want me to dine there or maybe they just wanted to egg me on in case they had a cancellation. I tried for 2 days to reach someone at 313-656-4511 to confirm my reservation and phone was never answered or just rang busy. It's clear the owner either does not have a sense of customer service or just treats certain people differently than others. I'm not sure but my anniversary was not as great as I wished it would have been and I would not recommend this place to anyone solely based on the extremely poor customer service. Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed. I have lived in Detroit all my life and have never been treated by a Detroit business so poorly. Please do not even call this place. Clearly it is poorly managed. :("
1 star rating,"A friend and I dined here around noon for Sunday brunch. Great food, and the staff was friendly. The downside for me was the inconvenience of the food located on 2 floors. The buffet is on the 3rd level and pancakes, omelets and desserts on the second level.  The second downside was although the DJ was great; absolutely playing great music. The music was way too LOUD for Sunday afternoon brunch. The volume was actually unbelievable. I struggled to hear my conversation! Overall pretty nice. The atmosphere is VERY casual, good food."
3 star rating,"I was invited to my sister's birthday brunch here from 1-3pm on Sunday. From the reviews and website, the restaurant seemed like an awesome place. I arrived at about 1:30 but had trouble locating it due to no outside signage but noticed a easel type sign through the door of the building. Ok no biggie, maybe it's up and coming. It was on the 3rd floor and the seating was nice but the lay out was awkward. It was buffet style and gave me more of the feel of a pop up or a event that was using it as a venue not a permanent spot. You had to go down stairs for something like omelets, desserts and  pancakes (no waffles like their website features), they kept running low on ingredients and had to stop to get more and you had to walk or take the elevator back up for the rest of the food. The assortment was nice but there were no signs to tell you what was what and they kept running out of things. Every time someone went from the table to get a plate they would come back with something else that was missing before or to report they were out of something else. The food was nothing to rave about and was not hot most of the time. Our waiter was ok. He was nice but when my friend reported hair in her food (like baked in the Mac and cheese)there was no manager that was called or informed. When she cashed out no adjustment to the bill was made until she inquired but even then the waiter replied ""we don't usually do that but I'll see."" So hair in the food is the norm? Most ppl complained about the mandatory gratuity but I understood given the concept and would have felt better about it if the service and experience was better. We didn't get a drink just water because well we were never told or given anything to say what the options were. I see the potential of the restaurant everywhere but there is a lot of work to be done. Sorry to say though wouldn't recommend going until improvements are made."
2 star rating,I'm a Chicagoan visiting with friends and searched google (upscale breakfast in Detroit) a cool & funky place with good vibes & great food for breakfast while I waited to meet my friends later.  This place is AMAZING! Great customer service from the moment I walked in. My server Aja is super friendly & bubbly. I told her to surprise me with a mimosa & she mixed mango & peach to make the absolute best mimosa. Food was flavorful & filling. GreAt background music and the vibe for an early Friday morning is just what I needed. Shared my discovery with my local friends and they're all coming back this weekend for the brunch. I'm finicky and very peculiar when it comes to food. Great vegan options for the non-meat lovers. Check them out. Thank Aja for making my solo bfast experience the best ever!
5 star rating,"I went to this restaurant today and although our waiter was good and often apologetic, this place has A LOT of work to do. Upon entering the building, it reeks of mildew. Luckily, when you go to the 3rd floor, the mildew smell was not up there. They had ONE waiter working the entire  establishment and then owner was in the kitchen cooking. This was the SLOWEST meal I've ever experienced. Many items listed on the menu were unavailable, the owner slash cook failed to prepare the steak medium well and when it was sent back, we were advised that was the LAST steak. Some of the food ordered by the people in my party never made it to the table. If it wasn't for the nice waiter, I would rate this place 1 star. My 4 friends and I won't be returning."
2 star rating,Nice vibe with music and open setting on the third floor. Service was solid. Food quality was pretty good but not mind blowing (buffet). Would go again with a large group. Would help to have more advertisement outside of the establishment clarifying location and floor.
3 star rating,My friend and I went on a Saturday. We thought this place was WAY overpriced. $25 for a buffet. They didn't have a omelette station. The food was mediocre at best. The coffee was $2.50 with an additional charge for refills. (No one told us that) The waiter was super nice though. Ambience was very nice too.  The music they were playing was hip/hop rap. So to each it's own on that one.
