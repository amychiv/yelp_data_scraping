4.5 star rating,"The family got some these delightful goodies at the Eastern Market. I am a big fan of chess pie and this one was lemon! It was spectacular. It got a couple round hand size pies and another family member got a sweet potato cookie. The cookie was big, soft, and fresh. It tasted like it had nuts in it. The pie was delicious and fresh. I paired it with some Trader Joes lemon ice cream which went perfectly. I put the pie crust into the ice cream, amazing. The chess pie filling was perfect, a nice bruleed with a silky creamy filling. I would buy these again."
5 star rating,"Thanks Yelpers! We were in town for the weekend and found this spot on Yelp! I love sweet potatoes and I wasn't disappointed. My husband and I got our food to go. We both had the sweet potato waffle, he had wings and I had turkey sausage. I also had the black eyed pea and collard green soup. We also loaded up with plenty desserts, sweet potato cake, pie and cheesecake. Everything was delicious but the cheesecake was my favorite! I love supporting local black-owned businesses."
5 star rating,I had a chance to try a few mini pies over the weekend. I'm very impressed. The pies were tasty and flavorful. I enjoyed the selections. I will have to return for a full size pie selection. I also would like to try the other food offerings outside of dessert. Not the best Ive had but waaaaaaayyyyy better than the worst.
5 star rating,"Hmmmm! I can't believe that I have never reviewed Sweet Potato Sensations!This little sweet shop - turned full fledged restaurant complete with a savory menu, has been a staple in their community for quite some time now.I remember when they opened, my school co-workers and I ordering mini pies, cheesecakes, chess pie, and cookies and being amazed that they were made with sweet potato as we passed them around the break room.I have also enjoyed the cookies, which are available at the historic Redford Theater across the street, while I've watched classic movies.There is a little boutique area in the restaurant that has changed into many things over the years. I have purchased sassy t-shirts and ""afro-centric"" jewelry here in the past. The success of the business is attributed to the loving, funny and warm family that owns it. It has been a pleasure to watch the business grow offering more and more yumminess as time has gone by. On my last visit I ordered fried turkey chops, sweet potato grits (mmmm hmmm) and a sweet potato waffle. The meal was outstanding and really felt like food for my soul!The savory menu also boasts a turkey sandwich, salmon croquettes,  black eyed pea & collard green soup, chicken wings and sweet potato pancakes.Other sweets include lemon chess pie, cobblers, various cakes and sweet potato ice cream.Can you imagine such deliciousness in one place???Do not make the mistake of never trying out this gem. You will love it!"
5 star rating,I've always heard about this place. I had a friend in town and she seen their food on Instagram. So we decided to visit. Best decision ever and I'll most definitely be returning. Great customer service and prices.
5 star rating,"Amazing food, fresh, unique, friendly staff and great atmosphere. Order the turkey chops."
5 star rating,Great place for homemade treats and meals made by a family. I love small businesses that treats you like family and most items here is great.
5 star rating,This sweet potato pies are great tasting in every way . This is their specialty. If you like ginger brew they sell a bottle drink their names the real Jamaican ginger brew A lil expensive for the bottle size . But great taste .
5 star rating,"Supporting local and black owned business.Dessert = 2 for $7 (mini pies)This is my 2nd time visiting here but this around it was only for dessert.  I tried the sweet potato cheesecake, lemon, and sweet potato pie.  Honestly I wanted to love the cheesecake but the taste was TOO sweet and something wasn't balance.Let me end on positive (of course) - try the food which is amazing; clearly I need to increase my food pallet instead of the sweet pallet.  Happy Eating!!!"
4 star rating,creative.  delicious.  decadent.  mouth watering sweets and sweet potato sensations.  been buying baked goods for approximately 20 years.  love the location and the pies/cakes even more.
4.5 star rating,"Good sandwich, but disappointed by the lack of menu options. No sweet potato fries. A little pricey too."
3 star rating,"The pies are amazing, the best sweet potato pie I've ever had. The customer service makes you feel like you're with family."
5 star rating,"Excellent service, would like better parking but other than that I would say make the trip."
3 star rating,Love this plAce! I've been coming here ever since I was a little kid living in the neighborhood. Everything is worth trying! The collard green soup is excellent always! Sweet potato grits are also one of my favorites.
5 star rating,I love coming here when I'm visiting Detroit! I usually get the J.T special ( wings and sweet potato waffle). My husband got the fried Turkey chops with the sweet potato grits and pancakes. The Turkey chops were well seasoned! I tried the Nikki 's Ginger tea and it tasted good.
5 star rating,"So this is my second time here.The first time was horrible. I waited for 24 minutes in person at a table and never got waited on.Fast forward to today.I called ahead to order my food. Welp I was on hold for a whopping 27 minutes.So when you call and press 2, it says that it's 0 callers in the Queue, but Maury has determined that was a lie.. because it was 3 callers ahead of me. Advice stay on hold even though it sounds like they hung up on you. Just hang in there.So they say gluten-free here.. we'll I'm here to tell you take your activated charcoal with you because something is weird and has gluten back there okay.Heads up this is also a place where if you don't say anything you won't get anything: (condiment wise) so make sure when you get you to-go order that you ask for what you need because they didn't even give my ass a fork to go....I had sweet potato grits... let me tell you. If you don't add something to them you might think it's something wrong with your tastebuds. So help you self out and have a voice. My order came up quick.. (I went to get gas and I came back). The place is pretty decently sized and a nice vibe to hang out at like a cool ass social library with sweet potato pies surrounding you. If you like soul food and want something with a spin on it then this is your place. But if you are impatient then this might not be the joint for you."
3 star rating,"Got a pie from here in February for my boyfriend's birthday. It was amazing! Looked & realized that they had food! Got super excited. So the boyfriend & I decided to give their brunch a try. Boom huge disappointment their service SUCKS! We at least it did for us. We walked in it was pretty busy, we were at the register not knowing the rules if we had to order from the register then sit down or what not. The cashier directed us to have a sit since we were dining in. So we have a seat next to the bar. Literally 20 long minutes go by as servers pass us with food, checks are being taken up, more people walking in. One young lady walked in and they immediately got her served and coffee. Meanwhile my boyfriend & I don't even have a menu and no one said hello. So now we're pissed and both of our phones are out in search of eating somewhere else. So I'm putting my coat on and a server finally asks us, ""oh have you been helped yet"", mind you everyone else has food on their tables but us. Anyways that question was too late seriously. Their communication skills between the servers & cashiers need to get better. This was a horrible experience. I would suggest that you order at the cash register no matter what the cashier says! Then have a seat! Idk if I will give them a try again idk if I'm pissed or more so disappointed.."
1 star rating,bought a sweet potato pie here for thanksgiving and there was only 1 slice leftover!!! so yummy! eat this with some whipped cream or vanilla ice cream and you have yourself a winner winner!! everyone here is friendly. you can buy these early and store in your freezer. then leave out to unthaw it in the fridge a day before you wanna eat it. I recommend this!
5 star rating,The best pie ever .. If I was you I would get my pie 4-5 days early the lie is going to be down Lasher ...!
5 star rating,"This place is phenomenal!! The staff is super nice and friendly, I love great customer service and that is what I found here. The food is amazing as normal. The desserts are so so good. I had the mango peach cobbler which was so good! Sweet in a great way, perfect amount of crust. The vegan lemon blueberry cake is light and moist. It leaves such a great flavor in your mouth.I got some black eyed pea and collard soup and took it home to eat. It was so perfectly delicious I drove the 20 minutes back the same day for another bowl! Please do yourself a favor and stop here! You will not be sorry!"
5 star rating,Words cannot describe this place. Truly amazing. Everything is good!!! Absolutely love the salmon croquettes and the sweet potato pancakes. Still eating. Haven't gotten to the actual sweet potato pie yet. BRB lol

1 star rating,"I really love this place!! The chicken and sweet potato waffle combo is so delicious!! And the baby sweet potato cake,oh my goodness,it's almost like a carrot cake but WAYYYY better,lol!!"
5 star rating,"Only reason I gave this star, the vegan chocolate cake.! Otherwise, I was totally disappointed- black eye pea soup was Horrible! I don't know who was cooking that day- but they need to stop! Ordered the salmon croquettes with sweet potato pancakes- they were SO FISHY AND HORRIBLE! I was suggested by a friend, I texted her immediately- gurl the suggestion for this restaurant- NO WAY GURL! Fried turkey chop on croissant - HORRIBLE! BASICALLY I JUST DONATED $ to THIS RESTAURANT CAUSE EVERYTHING WENT IN THE GARBAGE!  NEVER EVER EVER EVER AGAIN!!"
1 star rating,"It's average in my opinion and I wouldn't go out of my way to get anything from there again. We ordered two mini sweet potato cheesecakes, a mini sweet potato pie and a mini lemon chess pie. I liked the Cheesecake best - it was delicious though not as good as Peteet's. I didn't care for the lemon chess pie and the SPP was average. I like my mom's sweet potato pie better. We ordered through DoorDash and only received one of the two cheesecakes that we ordered. This is fairly common with DoorDash orders, at least in my experience, and I'm not sure if its just that the restaurants aren't paying attention to the quantity or if it's an issue with the ordering system."
3 star rating,"Everything was amazing and FRESH. The service was AMAZING, friendly and a bunch of smiling faces."
5 star rating,Great place for all things sweet potato! Great food and service! It is certainly a diamond in the rough.

5 star rating,"When I tell y'all this is one of the best meals if not the best meal I've had in my life... I mean it. I had the salmon croquettes, the sweet potato grits, and the sweet potato pancakes. This place is genius. Adding sweet potato flavor to some of our favorite dishes is such a simple but innovative way to create a cuisine masterpiece. The flavor of this food is simply out of this world. Literally send you to a different dimension. And to top it all off, this place has a wide selection of jewelry and other treasures sold inside of the store. This includes crystal and spiritual pieces. This place is Black owned, so of course it meets the supreme standard of excellence."

5 star rating,"This place tastes like home. It was so good to my soul and my stomach that I went back twice in a row. Recently, I was on business for a week in the area. Went in and tried the salmon croquettes, sweet potato grits, the turkey chop croissant sandwich, chicken wings, black eyed pea and collard soup, sweet potato pancakes as well as the sugar free sweet potato pie and ginger tea.Food was seasoned to a T and cooked to perfection. This is a family run business and service was great. I'm sorry I didn't take any pictures of the food. I devoured it all. Our party left very satisfied and eating at this eatablishment was the highlight of my week!7/19/19 - Went back while I was in town for the DiversityFIRST credentialing program @ Wayne State and it was like I never left. They didn't have any sugar free pies made but I did have the Daddy-O and got the Turkey Chop Sandwich to go. I was the envy of the airport terminal!"

1 star rating,"I absolutely love Sweet Potato Sensations!  I've been there several times, since moving back to the east side of the state!  I actually found out about this place, just with a simple google search one day.  And remembering wanting to try the sweet potato pies, to compare to an old school bakery, that's a staple in my old neighborhood. I have never been disappointed!  I've tried the Sweet Potato pies several times, the Sweet Potato Cookies, and 3-Layer Sweet Potato Cake.  All were delicious!  Also, the staff have always been super friendly and very nice!  The restaurant has always been clean, and I love the quaint feel when I have gone there.I look forward to go back soon!  I'm a sweet tooth person, which I can eat all sweets!  However, I would love to try the hot food once I go back, Bc I would love to try the Black Eye Pea and Collard Green Soup!"
5 star rating,"I think they were overwhelmed with the amount business they attracted from the hair expo going on across the street. So I can't speak on the service because they were understaffed and I wasn't in a rush.While waiting they brought me a sample of the black eye peas with greens soup. It was good but I didn't order it. I recommend getting this.It took about 40 minutes from the time I arrived until I got my food.It was worth the wait. I really enjoyed my chicken and waffles. I wanted more chicken after I was done. The waffle is big and very filling; it had a great taste.I'd definitely come back for this, but they're are a few other things on the menu I'd like to try. I'll be back. I don't know when, but I'll be back!"

5 star rating,"Had lunch here yesterday.  Had the sweet potato pancakes (delicious) and the turkey sandwich on a croissant.  Companion had the chicken and waffles, which was three chicken wings.  I think she was expecting a fried chicken breast or thigh.  Very friendly staff.  Was a little slow because they were short-handed.  Wish they had a side sampler (e.g. sweet potato grits with sweet potato cornbread with sweet potato pie) on the menu."
4 star rating,"All I can say is sweet and savory!!! This place is capsulated off Lahser Rd north from Grand River harbored near other businesses of course. But this place is very unique not only because of the food but the ethics behind the business. I met the owner Espy who is really dope because she is the 2nd generation for ownership and even very supportive of other Black businesses that are Detroit produced and growing. Anywho they started as a bakery and now expanded to small eats such as Catfish, Fried Chicken, sandwiches, and soups... But the kicker is they are all Sweet Potato  recipe inspired from the cornbread to the waffles. Very tasty I did inquire will sides expand because right not they are all breakfast related such as eggs grits etc. but nevertheless the food is good and fresh and you can taste that!"
5 star rating,I'm always searching for great sweet potato pie and this was one of the best I've ever had. The pecan pie is also fantastic. Loved the fried turkey chop sandwich and the black eyed pea & collard green soup. Wonderful customer service. Everyone was wearing masks. Can't wait to return and try more items on their menu!
5 star rating,I am a fan! The collard green and black eye pea soup is soooooo good (side note: this soup comes vegetarian or with Turkey meat) and get the sweet potato cornbread muffin and Change your life. They also provide a full menu of delicious food items. The bakery is another experience! Sweet potato pie is one of my favorite desserts and  they also make a variety of sweet potato featured desserts (I've tried the cookies as well). Everything I've had here is tasty. I've dined a few times and had very good service as well.
5 star rating,"This place is conveniently located right across the street from the Redford Theater where I'm currently rehearsing for the musical Shrek with the Park Players. It's a chilly, snowy Sunday and I could think of nothing better than a hot cup of soup! OK, if you've never been here, you absolutely have to try the Vegan Black-Eyed Pea and Collard Greens soup! For no extra charge, you can add smoked turkey... this is an absolute must! They also give you a hot sweet potato cornbread muffin which is wonderful crumpled in the soup! As if the food wasn't awesome enough,this place has plenty of natural light and is colorful, creative with original artwork on the walls, clean and charming. Their theme is obviously sweet potatoes and you can order a variety of foods with the sweet potato ingredient as the star!  I've had the sweet potato corn muffin but there are also sweet potato cookies, pancakes, waffles, cheesecake, cobbler and of course sweet potato pie, which I can't wait to try! Hey, that rhymed! LOL!Anyway, this will be, at least for the next couple of months, my go-to place for nourishment in the middle of our six hour rehearsals on Sundays! I plan on trying one of their savory sandwiches next time... My Mama's Tuna sandwich, the Jive Turkey sandwich, Salmon Croquette sandwich and Fried Chop sandwich. Yummy!"
5 star rating,"Made a stop here based on previous reviews.  We visited on a Sunday morning before noon.  We did not have to wait and was greeted by Steve who was awesome. He provided excellent customer service.  He let us sample the black-eyed pea collard green soup and sweet potato grits.  After devouring that, we ordered that as well as fried catfish, salmon croquettes and sweet potato pancakes.  Everything was delicious.  The catfish was so fresh and cooked to perfection. The soup was amazing.  The sweet potato pancakes were the best that we ever had. The establishment was very clean and welcoming.  There was a DJ playing smooth jams.  The atmosphere was different from anything that we have seen at a restaurant.  The price was very reasonable and we left there very satisfied. We will definitely return to this restaurant when we visit Detroit.  We highly recommend this establishment."
4.5 star rating,"This spot is a weekly ritual.  I switch up on savory menu items and alway indulge myself from the sweets side. I  love coming here cause it feels like family. Even when they are busy they still great you with a smile and even know customers by name. I'm late giving this review so I'm sure you know already. If not, give them a try. Enjoy"
5 star rating,"Went there today for the 1st time.The young lady that was my server was so cool and polite.I had the turkey chop sandwich that was very fresh and tasted great, and also a bowl of the black eyed pea collard green soup and let me tell you I believe I could eat the delicious soup daily a little spicy which I love it came with a sweet potato corn bread muffin that was excellent. The service was good and the restaurant is spotless, I very much enjoyed my lunch."
5 star rating,"Me and my group had lunch here and it CHANGED OUR LIVES. We're from NY and have had our share of chicken and waffles, but the sweet potato waffle with fried chicken I had today ranks pretty high. The waffle was sweet but not overpowering and was perfectly paired with the crunchy chicken. It kind of melted in your mouth and left you satisfied. My friend and I shared a cheesecake as well which was unbelievably moist and rich and the sweet potato texture and flavor shone. We tried a lot of different things on the menu and loved everything! The ambience is really laidback and warm, and the store sells natural hair products and jewelry too which is great. The service was also really attentive and friendly so we felt right at home. Definitely a place with a lot of love and community pride and we will be back soon!"
5 star rating,Stopped here for brunch and really enjoyed this place. We were waited on by Steve who gave us samples of their black eye pea and collard green soup which was really good; also sampled the sweet potato cheese cakeyummy!! We had sweet potato pancakes and chicken wings which were seasoned to perfection!! The DJ had the place rockin'!! Very nice!!
4 star rating,I met the owner in Best Buy from my sales associate he was scared to approach her so I did. Then I came to the shop and fell in love.  Her moms is a sweetheart show them some love Detroit very professional staff I know sweet potato is they thing but the chess pie  is the bomb too and the black eye pie and collards soup is delicious.
5 star rating,"1st off the vegan 3 bean soup is AMAZING!! Also order a Pecan Sweet Potato Pie, Sweet Potato Pie, Peach Cobbler and Sweet Potato Cookies! I definitely recommend!"
5 star rating,"If you haven't been here for brunch yet, you're missing out! My boyfriend and I went here before a show at Redord Theatre since it is right across the street. We sat down and our waitress was super friendly. I ordered the Daddy-O which is three large sweet potato pancakes with house-made spiced turkey sausage patties. It was HUGE and absolutely wonderful. You MUST try this. My boyfriend has the chop meal with the sweet potato grits which he really enjoyed as well!I was very impressed with our service and the place filled up quickly (it is small) but if you go early, you should be able to get a seat. The only reason I docked a star is because my mom ordered pies for Christmas from here and when we went to have them after Christmas dinner, we realized our plain cheesecake was actually a sweet potato cheesecake which bummed out my brother and the lemon chess pie wasn't your traditional lemon chess. We didn't really like it due to the fact that it had a cornmeal taste to it, but I don't want to downplay the quality of their desserts based on this fact alone. Contrary to the lemon chess, the Peach Cobbler I was told by everyone that had it, was the best peach cobbler they had ever had. So I'd recommend the Peach Cobbler over the Lemon Chess if you're looking for holiday (or just because you love it) pies :)"
4 star rating,"This is a truly ""sweet"" place to hang out, eat, and shop.  My two sisters, our family friend, and my mom had lunch there yesterday.  Oh my God!!!  I fell in love with the atmosphere, the owners, the service, the food, and, and and, everything about my experience at this hot spot.  It's mind blowing.  Our food was like love with a kiss from heaven served on a plate.  Not to mention that I now have a new edition to my family Germane, the owners's son.  He was charming, sweet, intelligent, entertaining, kind, cute as a button, and just like family.  If you haven't already been, do yourself a favor and visit Sweet Potato Sensations soon.  Sunday's they offer entertainment and free cake.  Nothing's better than free cake.  Enough said!!!!"

1 star rating,"This place is so good.I usually get their pies at Eastern Market but I happened to be in the neighborhood and stopped in for some lunch. Lucky for me, even though I didn't plan it, it was Waffle Wednesday!  The stars aligned just for me. And so, I couldn't allow myself to order anything other than chicken and waffles (which are otherwise only a weekend affair!)A beautifully spiced sweet potato waffle (one of the best I've had) accompanied three beautifully fried, perfectly juicy chicken wings. It was way too big of a portion for lunch. I ate all of it.I also ate the sample of soup they kindly brought me (collard greens and black eyed peas), and it was super delicious. I also walked out with a stack of their mini pies.I have no self control.The moral of the story is, if you're like me and also have no impulse control, it's all worth it...and if you're feeling guilty, no one you know will say no to mini pies. And you're supporting a lovely small business, so really, what could be wrong about that? Exactly. (I'm good at rationalizing, can you tell?)Get here now!"
4.5 star rating,"I had never tasted sweet potato pancakes before today. They're delicious!!!  If you're in Detroit, do your stomach a favor and stop here for a meal. Although I'm a southern lady, I don't like grits. So my travel Buddy devoured my sweet potato grits while I choked down on my sweet potato pancakes & salmon croquettes (you get two big patties). Yum!!!"
5 star rating,"We stopped by before a show at the Redford Theatre, and they stayed open a little later than their normal hours for us, which was nice.  We all ordered the sweet potato cheesecake which was seriously the best cheesecake I've ever eaten.  Not too sweet with the perfect creamy texture...seriously, never make cheesecake yourself.  Order this one and take it to your next party!  We also took home a dozen cookies - red velvet and chocolate chip, both of which were chewy, sweet goodness.  We actually bake, but these were JUST like homemade...if not better.  The young lady working the counter was very nice as well. Check them out!"
5 star rating,"After church, it's time to grub.The sweet potato pancakes were amazing. The sweet potatoe pie is really good.!"
5 star rating,"Great place. Great food and staff.   The food is nice and hot, and is full of flavor.  I had the catfish, with Grits, eggs and sweet potato pancakes.  I was really impressed with the entire plate.  My wife had turkey pork chops and sweet potato grits  which was out of this world.  This will definitely be a place on my roster of restaurants in the future.  It is unbelievable this fantastic restaurant was only a mile from where I grew up and it is outstanding."
5 star rating,It's been a LONG time since my tastebuds have done a happy dance like this before and it is all in thanks to that sweet potato cheesecake pie. I will tell you that you won't find another cheesecake like this (not even at that place in 12 oaks mall). I urge anyone looking for a sweet new experience to try it!!!I wasn't a huge fan of their sweet potato muffins but that may have been because the sweet potato cheesecake trumps all.The location is right across the street from the Redford Theater so you can catch a flick AND follow up with your sweet tooth.I'm looking forward to having more locals (and everyone else) try this place and grow to like it as much as I do. It does not disappoint.
5 star rating,The food was awesome!! Very tasty! I ate the salmon croquettes and sweet potato waffle. So good!
5 star rating,"Stopped by here yesterday after visiting Motor City Java House and picked up some miniature (2"" diameter) pies -- sweet potato, lemon chess, and pecan.  Did this based on a recommendation from a friend, even though I'm not much of a pie fan.  The reason I'm not generally a big pie fan is the crust.  It always seems dry or slightly burned or doughy or... something not quite right.  But Sweet Potato Sensations crust is delicious!  My guess is that this means they use lard in their crust, which is fine by me.  Now, for the fillings.  Sweet potato - good; not too sweet, light and fluffy.  Pecan - good; sweet and nutty without being goopy at all.  Lemon chess - out of this friggin' world! - beautiful custard texture, lemony without the slightest acidity."
4 star rating,"Such a sucker for sweet potatoes, and even a bigger sucker for sweets. I drove 40 min from AA just to get myself some pie, and that pie did not disappoint! It has tables that are waited on, or you can get food to go. Mini sweet potato pie $3 (4.5/5) - Really was a pleasant surprise. Couldn't give it 5/5 because this was my sweet potato pie cherry. But my goodness it was yummy! On the sweeter side but how could pies not be sweet. It was rich and full of sweet potato flavors. I can't say I regret driving 40 min to try this. Sweet potato pancakes (3.5/5) - Could have been 4/5 if the pancake middle was not just uncooked batter :( For the two of the three pancakes that were cooked through, it was really fluffy and delicious on a cold winter Detroit day. However, my only complaint about the flavor is that it's a bit too heavy on pumpkin spice. At one point I felt like I was eating pumpkin spice pancake as it overpowers the sweet potato flavor. But for texture it really is yummy. Fluffy and slightly crunchy on the edge.I do think this place is worthwhile a visit. For someone who doesn't know the area well (like me) I have to say a little Asian girl does kind of stick out like a sore thumb in the surrounding area. So I probably won't be back but glad that I got to try such delicious pie."
4 star rating,"I had J.T's Special which is a Belgian sweet potato waffle and three whole Amish chicken wings. The waffle and wings were great. I also had the sweet potato cake, and it's good also."
4 star rating,Sweet Potato Sensations is a long-time Detroit gem. Nestled in a quaint corner in northwest Detroit in an eclectic and artsy neighborhood across from the Historic Redford Theatre. The food is delicious. The menu has expanded tremendously over the last few years with a varied menu of breakfast and lunch items. As one who does not particularly care for sweet potatoes. I'm amazed at the delicious creations. My fave being the cake and chocolate chip cookies with or without nuts. The family-owned and operated business is full of love that comes through in all aspects of the business! In addition to dining sufficiently they have creative Detroit-based artists who display and sell various wears and wares!  Just an all around great spot.
4.5 star rating,"Sweet Potato Sensations is a gem. From the chicken and sweet potato waffles to the soup to the salmon croquettes, grits and and sweet potato pancakes, we could not get enough of each dish. And not only are our bodies nourished, but our spirits are too. The entire restaurant is incredibly warm (and smells heavenly) and Esby took such good care of us. We cannot wait to drive up from Chicago for another visit!"
5 star rating,"The best part about eating out is discovering the culture that can exist in cuisine alone. Sweet potato sensations is a hot spot for Black culture, conversation, and art. Each time I go I'm reminded how beautiful it is that food can bring great minds, talents, and conversations together under one roof. Outside of the warm ambience the food & staff reminds me of Sunday Dinners at my Grandmother's home. Warm, friendly, and wise. My favorite is the chicken and sweet potato waffle."
5 star rating,The server was kind & polite however the service she provide was terrible she gave me warm water I ask for ice for my water and never received it I ordered orange juice with my meal & never got it when paying for my food did she offer me orange juice I don't need it now I finished my meal! All of that being said the food was delicious but the service is terrible & bad
1 star rating,"Pairs great with a night at The Redford Theatre across the street. Mayor and City Council, this block is a great example for the city and deserves high praise! I had a mini sweet potato pie. It was tasty, and the service was nice. However I had no idea they served more than desserts, so I guess I have to go back and check out the rest of the menu soon. As others have mentioned, it seems like they stay open later than the posted hours when there's an event across the street."
4 star rating,Love this place - amazing pies and sandwiches and the staff are truly great. Always look forward to visiting Sweet Potato Sensations when I am in the area.
5 star rating,"The only thing that could make this better would be pralines.  Everything is good.  The waffles and fried wings are to die for.  The soups are good. The deserts - wonderful.  The staff?  Friendly, engaging, outgoing, informative and caring."
5 star rating,"This place is a hidden gem! Although I was hesitant while driving (kind of sketchy), it was totally worth it! The employees here are great! They were all very friendly and I was greeted with smiles even though I came in 10 minutes before closing. Unfortunately, they were out of the sweet potato ice cream, but I was able to try their sweet potato cheesecake and cookies with almonds/chocolate chips. Both were beyond my expectations. You can really taste the unique sweet potato flavors in both baked goods. I will definitely be visiting again (hopefully not 10 mins before closing :P) so that I can experience the flavor of their sweet potato ice cream."
5 star rating,"Ive watched this community grow over the years. To be specific it amazes me of all the local business that have opened and grown . More importantly i love supporting black owned business that has great service. The prices aren't to bad and the food is great . I love the ice cream selection, the banana pudding ice cream is my favorite. The service is very nice. The atmosphere is a comfy caffe with a mellow ambiance."
5 star rating,"Pies are soooo good! Call ahead to order for thanksgiving tho! The salmon croquette sandwich is just wow. Sweet potatoes are incorporated into everything, even ice cream. Cute little restaurant; perfect place for catching up with someone or going on a quick lunch rendezvous."
5 star rating,"Great place. I've tried there cookies, sweet potato pie, all good in the hood. The prize here is the sweet potato cheesecake, it's the best."
4.5 star rating,"The food was absolutely delicious and they took care of us like we were guests in their home. Their fried chicken was one of the best I've had- super moist, super crispy and flavorful. Their mac and cheese was also really good too, as was their roast sweet potatoes and roast salmon. I also ended the meal with their lemon chess pie with ice cream that was amazing too! LOVE this place...it's homey and delicious and they have a fantastic menu!"
5 star rating,"Im a trucker and a foodie. Came into town to pickup a load an ordered punch here. They have sweet potato everything! I ordered the chicken and waffles. It was delicious. Also ordered the grits and salmon croquettes, simply delicious as well. The best part is the sweet potato cheesecake.  It was fresh moist and delicious.  Would definitely order from here again!!!"
5 star rating,The pies are excellent it really put me in the mind of an old fashioned southern sweet potato pie competition the taste is unbelievable it is definitely the best I ever had.
5 star rating,Incredible. My wife and I shared and tried the following :Sweet Potato Cheesecake Sweet Potato Coconut PieSweet Potato Cobbler Sweet Potato Walnut Chocolate Chip Cookie Lemon PieThey were all no joke.

5 star rating,"I love love love love coming here. There's all a sweet welcoming aroma when you come in. The mini pies are so good, just good for a quick sweet snack or bite size selfish moment. I've had some things off the food menu and sweet  Jesus  o would love to eat there everyday. Good good. All they need is a sweet potato latte"
4.5 star rating,This was the worst sweet potato pie I have ever had. I couldn't get it down. I read all the reviews before I went and I was highly disappointed. The pie was dark and chunky.
1 star rating,Absolutely Devine!!! I had a turkey sandwich....so simple but yet so delicious. Mini sweet potato pie (not my moms) but close enough :)
5 star rating,After reading raving reviews I had to stop by this black owned establishment. The service was great and the collard green bean soup was even better!! I enjoyed the delicious pies! The only thing I didn't like was limited menus and this is because I am fat lol! I love that they have youth working here.. it's a nice place to go to and it has a relaxing atmosphere

4 star rating,"Ok I have to fess up, I am not much of a fan of pumpkin pie since I sunk my teeth into sweet potato. I am spoiled from a family friend's stellar homemade but these definitely are fabu. Creamy and rich with a good crust.They have the regular variety as well as one with pecans and one with coconut. They also have some 2"" minis (like a tart) in packs of six or twelve called sweeties. This is good for someone like me who needs to practice portion control. They have really decent sugar free which is great but I have to confess I prefer the regular by far.They also have lemon chess pies and tarts, they are good too. I do love anything lemon.They have sweet potato cheesecake too, my dad is a fan. I like it but I am more into the pie, I have to be in the right mood for cheesecake and I can rarely eat it more than once in awhile. Personally I think the pie is plenty rich and sweet for me.I have not tried the cookies but they look awesome, ditto on the regular sweet potato cakes. They have some regular and pecan sweet potato ice cream but I have never sampled it, people brag on it though. I am intrigued by the sweet potato cobbler.Service is so very friendly. The products are always super fresh and just delicious."
4 star rating,"The perfect way to satisfy the ol' sweet tooth when you're waiting for a show at the Redford Theatre! I was at the Redford last night for the premiere of the new Wonderland DVD and we got there a little before doors so rather than stand in line in the freezing cold we decided to run across the street to Sweet Potato Sensations and get a little nibble.They have a number of different pies to choose from--sweet potato (natch), lemon chess pie, and the like. They also have some sweet potato cheesecake, cookies, and cupcakes (in sweet potato and other flavors like banana). They also have ice cream in a few different varieties as well plus some savories likes soups and sandwiches.  I've had the cookies at the Redford (they sell them in little packets) and I sincerely hate to admit I wasn't the world's biggest fan. They were just a little dry for my taste. But everything else looked amazing so this time around I decided to give the sweet potato pie a whirl and picked up a mini pie with coconut.Oh. My. Goodness.Blew me away with deliciousness. The crust was outstanding--nice and rich and flaky. The center was cooked perfectly with a wonderful sweetness and consistency. The right amount of spice and the coconut was a fantastic addition that I'm not sure I would have considered paring with sweet potato. I was in heaven. It was the perfect treat to break my ""no sugar"" rule I was attempting that week. Alas. But totally totally worth it. The price was really reasonable and the mini tart was the perfect size for sharing which I did. To top it all off the staff was nice as all get out. The gal behind the counter and I chatted about our mutual fabulous taste in prescription eye ware (she had really cute glasses!). I felt really comfortable the moment I stepped in here. For special occasions you can order full cheesecakes, pies, sweet potato cakes (with walnuts, raisins, pineapple, and cream cheese icing), sweet potato cobbler, sweet potato ice cream, sweet potato muffins, etc (WHEW) and pick them up in the store. Or just pop in and see what they've got on hand for a little whenever treat!"
4 star rating,"I love this place. I eat brunch or lunch here as often as possible. Wrapping up Saturday morning errands and need somewhere to eat, I usually head their way. Saying the food is delicious is probably an understatement. The staff is friendly and attentive. The dining area is always clean. ... I don't really have much more to ask. I usually get the chicken and waffles but I've tried other things on the menu, it never disappoints! Also, when you go you MUST try the black bean and collard green soup. I know it may not SOUND amazing, but it is! Trust me, just try it!"
5 star rating,"Service was a 4/5. Took about 2 min to be acknowledged once I walked in the door. They have a limited menu selection during the week Sweet potatoe waffle was good wings were a bit small. Not really ""amish"""
4 star rating,"Everything. Is. Delicious!Courteous staff, beautiful decor and Detroit apparel/souvenirs!"
5 star rating,Stoped on our way out of town and got several mini sweet potato pies as well as a lemon Chess and pecan. They were all amazing!!!!!
5 star rating,I was alittle disappointed. Just wasn't what I expected. No food items were available. Items are slighted high as far as cost.
4.5 star rating,I love this place.  So homey:). The food and staff are comforting!  The fried chicken is a must and of course the sweet potatoe pie! I also recommend the collared green soup:). They will give you a little sample of your not sure about it!
5 star rating,LIVE DJ! Most importantly! (Jussaaayyyin). This place is the best place to not just eat but have a great time! The food is amazing and you will leave full. I recommend their pancakes and their grits
5 star rating,"They have some of the best pies in metro Detroit. They are a family run business that really puts their love in the food, they sell more than just sweet potato goods. Prices are affordable and customer service is always pleasant and quick. Highly recommend"
5 star rating,"This long-time family-owned restaurant is a must-stop anywhere near the Brightmoor neighborhood. I ate chicken wings and a sweet potato waffle for brunch during my first visit to Detroit, and it was easy to see why they've been in business so long. The fried chicken wings had the lightest, most perfectly crispy outside that I've ever had (and I'm from the South). The family members serving us were so friendly and fun. And the merch inside is fabulous. Don't miss the coffee shop across the street, either. Love the food and the history!"
5 star rating,"Very nice place across the street from the Redford Theatre. I am not crazy about sweets, but I certainly liked their ""normal"" food. Salmon croquettes were satisfying. Service was great. I definitely will return when I go to Redford Theatre next time."
4 star rating,great atmosphere in this neighborhood and city staple. oh yeah the eats aimt so bad either.
5 star rating,I love this place. They keep thier establishment so clean and well organized. The service is wonderful. You can tell they really care about what they are doing and they are knowledgeable about their products. The food itself is so delicious. They have sweet potato everytging you can think of never knew i could love sweet potatoes so much. They also have other merchandise that you can purchase that is made in Detroit. I love that they keep true to thier roots. The are un the middle of an up and coming area and they dont let thier surroundings affect thier business negatively. I will come back to this place as often as possible.
5 star rating,"Delicious beyond words...! Have the sweet pie but don't forget about the cookies. Great for the holidays, special occassions and an everyday desert."
5 star rating,"Just take all my money - because I won't find anything better to spend it on. I go here as often as I can. The Saturday Brunch is a delicious option for sweet potato pancakes and waffles as well. Just about everything they make is a Sweet Potato lover's dream come true. I load up on the cookies, mini pies, and cakes for whenever I need gifts for others. Also the smoothies sold there are delicious as well. Go there and you'll know what all the hype is about."
5 star rating,"This place is great!!! The food is amazing and the atmosphere is very inviting.  Its jazzy,modern,afrocentric, creatively  energizing.  If I was to have a complaint  it would be that I want a larger menu from them however all the things  that  are  made on that menu is made well. Damn good job S.P.S. bravo can't wait to come back."
4.5 star rating,"Don't let the modest-looking building keep you from stepping through the doors, because there is deliciousness inside! We stopped in for a quick bite as part of a fun evening including watching ""Singing in the Rain"" across the street at the historic Redford theater.They have a juice bar at one end of the counter and ice cream at the other, and the middle is full of delightful bakery treats including pies, cakes, cookies, and other delicacies featuring sweet potatoes.Their meal menu includes ""the most delicious soup ever,"" according to one patron in line waiting to order. I asked the young woman behind the counter what her favorite meal is, and she said definitely the Chicken and Waffles. I ordered that, and my husband got their turkey sandwich.I have only ordered chicken and waffles one other time somewhere else and I was not impressed, but I will go back again, and again, just for this meal. The three huge, meaty chicken wings were perfectly fried, but the waffle was a slice of heaven! Sweet potato, cinnamon, and nutmeg made this waffle worthy of the title of ""dessert."" No syrup needed. Absolutely delicious!The place was busy, but things ran smoothly, service was quick  and the staff was fabulous, taking time to have real conversations with us and the other diners.It's a great find!"
5 star rating,Awesome place. Friendly staff. Great food. I had the sweet potato waffle and salmon croquettes which was delicious!  Parking is available in a lot on the side of restaurant or on the streets in the front.
5 star rating,"Well, it's not in the best of neighborhoods but I gave it a shot anyway. Very long wait time for a carry out. I ordered the sweet potato Belgian waffle with the house spicy turkey sausage. The sausage was quite salty. It had the flavor of spice but wasn't spicy hot. The waffle was ok, not enough syrup & no butter at all in the bag. I wanted to eat there but it was too warm in there for me. Ppl were fanning & workers were sweating. Overall, it was just alright. Maybe the pies are better."
2 star rating,"I love the  Baby Cakes the most.  Also enjoy  the Sweet Potato/pecan pie. The black  Eyed  pea soup is  absolutely  DELICIOUS!! All the staff are friendly, especially  the owner. The store is always clean and it's  a comfortable  place to relax and enjoy  your meal or treat...and free WiFi!!"
5 star rating,"Where do I begin....the service was great, the food was fresh and hot. I loved that the coffee mugs and plates were not the same at every table, I felt like I was at home. There was a comfortable, homey feeling. I loved the atmosphere and we will definitely be back!"
5 star rating,"Beautiful and heavenly pecan-topped sweet potato pie!!!I get them at the farmer's market on Wayne State campus (across form the Detroit Public Library on Cass) every Wednesday. They are super delicious. I've also tried the regular (without pecans), the coconut, and the lemon chess pies... all of which will please your mouth. But the pecan sweet potato pies are atmospheric... even the crust which i usually hate (i hope that means extra Crisco or something... yum!)"
4 star rating,"I'm doing only 4 stars, because I've only experienced them at Cityfest, Tastefest, whatever it's called. Hah.Let me tell you, I spend a majority of my tickets there every year. Their little 'tart' sized sweet potato pies are delicious.Looking at the website, I'm a bit disappointed with their hours, but their prices are great for the quality of food they sell."
4 star rating,"I have only visited their booth at Eastern Market (I am also a vendor), never the restaurant, but I think they're amazing! They have something for everyone, pies with pecans, coconut, lemon, cakes, cookies, sugar free...now I'm getting a craving.I think their entire business is a fantastic idea, all the foods they serve are fabulous and delicious. They have such an innovative menu with all sorts of sweet potato based items. I love everything I have tried, but this past Saturday I tried their bon-bons. They were amazing! They were gingery and rich and sweet, all things I love. I had them straight from the cooler so they were cold (I only like cold foods), and the texture was amazing like that! Their ice cream (a huge part of my diet, loving cold food and all) is so good too. I love ice creams with round fall-y flavors like that (butter pecan, maple-y, pumpkin, etc), and theirs is to die for! Ask for it anytime you swing by Eastern Market!  Another thing that is great is their prices. They're so inexpensive! Some market items are a pretty penny, but they aren't bad at all. I don't remember the price for their ice cream, but I remember thinking they could raise it and I would still buy it! You would pay more for a grocery store pie than you would for their homemade ones! The lady who does their sales at the market is also really nice and sweet! She knows a lot about the company and is good with all the questions people ask her. She is not pushy, but recommends products well when people come and say things like, ""I need a dessert for a dinner party,"" or ""I have guests coming into town, what's popular?""They are just a really good company. The owners are nice and down to earth, and the market vendors are too. It's like buying a pie from someone you've known for years! I hope their business continues to be successful and grows!"
5 star rating,"To be honest I did not know what to expect, but I am so glad I went. The atmosphere is warm and enviting, as is the owner who came to visit our table. The best thing on the whole menu (I had the fish croquets), hands down, no questions asked -- the sweet potato pancakes. They were melt in your mouth, no need for anything else on top, or side of them to just savor and enjoy. I also really liked the sweet potato grits but the potato pancakes made my day. This place is only 15 minutes away from my house in Southfield so you know i will be back."
5 star rating,"Love this place, especially for chicken and waffles. Staff is warm and friendly and the restaurant is bright and colorful--lots of great artwork. Grab some sweet potato pie for dessert and take a stroll around Old Redford. Expect a longer wait--kitchen and service can be slow. Otherwise, great west side spot!"
4.5 star rating,"This was the second time that I visited Sweet potato sensations and had a bad experience. I had purchased an 8in. sweet potato cheesecake which was pretty good but service was terrible. The 3 women at the front counter were very  rude. I had been waiting in line for about 15 minutes and never was acknowledged. As I was waiting to be helped one of them let another person cut the line in front of me. I asked why, she told me that she was taking cash only and asked AFTERWARDS if I was paying cash or credit. The only reason why I stayed and waited was because it was a specific request for a friend and was desperate. Because of this experience I will never come back here again."
1 star rating,Excellent pies!! Ooooo and the sweet potato ice cream is the bomb diggety!! They have great cakes and the collard greens and black eyed pea soup is over the top delicious!!! Don't forget to try the sweet potato waffles and...just go and try everything-I swear they do not disappoint!!!
5 star rating,Excellent! Bought a large variety of different sweet potato goodies and every one is exceptional. Would have gotten more but ran out of funds! I'll be back for more for sure. Super nice place too. Very warm feeling and the help very friendly. A place you HAVE to return to after your first visit. Don't pass this place up.
5 star rating,The BEST sweet potato pie!!
5 star rating,"Cute little bakery with lots of tasty treats - sweet potato cheesecake, cobblers, muffins, cookies, ice cream, etc.  The sweet potato cake with cream cheese frosting is really good.  Give this place a try!"

5 star rating,I had never had nor heard of sweet potatoe cookies before but i tried the for the first time at the Northwest farmers market on thursday. They were devine!! Sweet with nuts and raisins! Mmmmm
5 star rating,Terrible ... cold food no coffee was available when we got here. Hot chicken cold waffles and pancakes for brunch Saturday! They need to stick to cakes and pies cause  their restaurant ethic is terrible. Dont go!!
1 star rating,Been buying my Thanksgiving pies here for over 15 years. Best part of the holiday. Sweet potato cobbler is also delicous.

4 star rating,"Stopped by here yesterday after visiting Motor City Java House and picked up some miniature (2"" diameter) pies -- sweet potato, lemon chess, and pecan.  Did this based on a recommendation from a friend, even though I'm not much of a pie fan.  The reason I'm not generally a big pie fan is the crust.  It always seems dry or slightly burned or doughy or... something not quite right.  But Sweet Potato Sensations crust is delicious!  My guess is that this means they use lard in their crust, which is fine by me.  Now, for the fillings.  Sweet potato - good; not too sweet, light and fluffy.  Pecan - good; sweet and nutty without being goopy at all.  Lemon chess - out of this friggin' world! - beautiful custard texture, lemony without the slightest acidity."
