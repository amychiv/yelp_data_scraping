4.5 star rating,Long wait so grab a snack before. Totally worth the wait! The food was fresh and hearty. Thoroughly enjoyed myself! A few minutes walk from campus martius park.  Tomato soup 10/10 Healthy yummy options 10/10Service 10/10
5 star rating,"Always a wonderful time here.Kimchi fries are to die for. Be aware of a solid wait, but totally worth it"
5 star rating,This was a nice atmosphere and decent service. But the food was average.  We had the hash and the Steak Benny.   The food doesn't have a lot of seasoning and wasn't much better than going somewhere fast. We did like the drink that tastes like orange creamsicle.
3 star rating,"We're definitely going to have to give this one another try. We made the mistake of coming not that hungry - even after the hourlong wait to get a table. The space is small, and there's a large lobby where everyone waits to get a seat. It's kind of a mess, but the hosts try their best to make sure everyone is seated in the right order. Unfortunately, you can't join a waitlist online. You'll have to show up in person, and there's not a lot going on in the area. The food was delicious though. We had the duck fries, which were generously portioned. It's a good brunch spot if you can get past the wait, and I look forward to trying it out again."
4 star rating,"Quite the popular place for brunch here in downtown Detroit, especially on weekends. When I stopped by just before noon on a recent weekend, the quoted wait time for tables was up to 1 hour, although, mercifully, they had some space at the bar for singles, where the wait was a more reasonable 30 minutes.For brunch, you'll find all the usual dishes like benedicts, waffles, French toast, omelettes, sandwiches, and ""hash"" dishes, sometimes with slight twists on the ingredients. Some of the dishes like the ""spicy Korean fries"" and the duck bop hash that I had, which had ""Korean BBQ sauce,"" had some Asian touches, however small, to them. As for the duck bop hash, it was over all too quickly, featuring a very modest serving of duck and potatoes topped by two eggs.Still, this is all an upscale take on all the usual things you'd expect at brunch - all in an upbeat, lively, urban setting. Here's hoping that downtown Detroit continues to be reinvigorated with more venues like this!"
4 star rating,"We come here every year, it quickly became one of our fav brunch spots. Delish food and amazing service! This year I tried the duck bop hash and the spicy Korean fries, both were amazing! Will probably order that as my usual from now on. Not to mention their delish house made biscuits"
5 star rating,"The food was excellent, lots of good flavors as well as a large variety to choose from on the menu.  The prices were good for what you are getting and the wait staff is attentive and courteous.  Our server gave us great suggestions for our meals so don't be afraid to ask!  The ambience was okay.  It looks a little cuter online than the real deal, but other factors made up for that.  The tables are a bit too close together in my opinion for good conversation, but overall a good experience."
4 star rating,"Who doesn't love a great brunch!? There is something for everyone with a menu featuring locally sourced ingredients and housemade specialities that delight the pallet as well as the pocketbook. Seriously, the largest biscuits I have ever seen in a plate of biscuits and gravy. Great service plus Jasmine tea?! An instant classic for me. Plus the building is stunning."
4 star rating,"Love Dime Store, I just wish they did reservations or you could sign up on the wait list before you arrive. Generally the wait is more than 30 minutes but the food is worth it. They get you in and out and you still are able to enjoy your experience."
5 star rating,"In the word of unfilled restaurants, the Dime Store is going strong. I sat at the bar thus avoiding the waiting list.Great breakfast/lunch hangout in downtown Detroit. Other reviewers have raved about the breakfast and I can't add anything more. One of the specials was the corned beef omelet and I just had to try. The corned beef did not overpower the meal and it is filling. Just look at the pile of breakfast potatoes. Also, note the smaller cubes. Quicker even cooking means less brown bits.I could be a regular if I lived in Michigan."
4.5 star rating,"I was traveling from out of state to Detroit and wanted to try Dime Store after seeing it frequently recommended when researching brunch spots in the city. Glad I did, as this meal was phenomenal! Located inside the lobby of a polished financial district skyscraper, the restaurant had quite a few people in line to be seated, which is expected for a Saturday morning and worth the wait for the dining. The vibe once inside the eatery is modern and hip but cozy and bright, and service was prompt and friendly. The Eggs Benedict was perfectly poached and deliciously buttery and savory. I was surprised at the shining star of the dish, though - the salad, which was dressed in some sort of salty, tangy  vinaigrette that was incredibly unique, fresh and interesting and felt perfect for the brunch time of day. The Belgian Waffle was a nice dessert-like finisher- air fluffy soft and sweet. If I were a local, this spot would become a brunch favorite for sure. I'll definitely be back if I ever travel there again!"
5 star rating,Stopped in detroit on a layover and this brunch did not disappoint! My girlfriend and I got the BLTE and Korean BBQ fries and shared. It was the perfect amount for a midday meal. Really enjoyed the vibe of the place and the architecture of the building. Definitely recommend!
5 star rating,"Corned Beef BiscuitIt's a symphony in your mouth . Dime Store never disappoints!  They have an amazing breakfast sandwich in their specials list - a huge fluffy biscuit filled with corned beef, white cheddar, over hard egg & tangy buttered pickles with a grainy mustard mayo. A little sweet & tangy mixed with salty, buttery & creamy  This is one of the best savory sandwiches I've ever eaten. They get busy so go early (by/before 8:30)."
5 star rating,Definitely one of the best brunches I have ever had. The atmosphere was retro chic with upbeat music. The food was absolutely delicious. There was a 30 minute wait but they have a big waiting area and let you order coffee  while you wait.
5 star rating,Every dish arrived exactly as anticipated. Full of flavor! The peach cobbler French toast actually tasted like peach cobbler really good! Ingredients were all fresh. Price was worth it to me. I will definitely visit again
5 star rating,"My wife and I were on the hunt for the perfect brunch place in downtown Detroit. We were happy to stumble upon The Dime Store. First things first, I'm a coffee snob and the brew at this place can't be beat. I ordered the Dearborn bacon and avocado omelette.  Dime Store made a meal that could not have been more perfect for me!  It came with diced potatoes that were a little dry and room temp, but somehow still delicious!  I honestly ate every single bite. This place doesn't take reservations but if you have some time to spare you can walk around the city while waiting for your table. They will text or call you when your table is ready. It's a great way to spend a morning downtown!"
5 star rating,"Came here for weekend brunch! Overall it was a great and delicious experience. We got the lox salmon Benedict, and raspberry and candied ginger French toast. Only small suggestion would be changing up the home fries- as they were diced small they lacked flavor and texture compared to more largely cut home fries or hash browns. Definitely was more expensive of a brunch than other options around Detroit. Not insanely expensive but each dish was around $15ish. And be prepared to have a decent wait time on the weekends. They have it organized well with an automated system that shows your place in line, however as you are not able to add your name to the list ahead of time, you inevitably get stuck waiting for 30-45min even by 9am. Highly recommend just getting there early. Overall, was a lovely experience and glad to have this brunch option in downtown."
4 star rating,"The food and service here were excellent. However, it felt as if my girlfriend and I were on a double date with the couple next to us. If it weren't for the elbow-to-elbow seating arrangement, I would give the restaurant a 5 star rating."
4 star rating,"Top 5 Breakfast spots in the City of Detroit. This spot never misses to me. The Malted Belgian Waffle is amazing, flavorful and melts in your mouth. Veggie Omelette w/ Breakfast Potatoes is always good as well. Rare you find a House Made Turkey Breakfast Sausage Sandwich and let me tell you, it is amazing! The restaurant is small and not much of a looker, but the food makes up for it. Overall, great food. Simple."
4 star rating,"Can't wait to go back! I'll keep this simple... everything was delicious! Dime prides itself on everything being scratch made and it makes a difference. If you can get over the wait that's pretty typical every weekend lol, you will be in for a treat. Customer service was great from before we walked through the door. Kind, attentive, and the server was able to make some great recommendations.The food! Awwwww still drooling over that Malted Waffle with fresh fruit. Great texture. Not over sweet. Golden goodness. The buttermilk biscuit... I would literally come back just for 3 more of those. My friend order the chilaquiles benny and loved it, especially the homemade tortillas. She is from Texas and said they did not disappoint. Overall, can't wait to return and try some other goodies. I do wish they started offering more vegan or pescatarian options!! That would be amazing!"
4.5 star rating,"This place has the best biscuit I've ever had!!! Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday with brunch. They do not take reservations and this place is tiny so I suggest getting there early to snag a seat. I had the strawberry shortcake French toast with sausage patties and a biscuit on the side. I also had the Irish coffee but I subbed hot chocolate and omg it was divine but verrrrryyy strong! I did not care for the sausage patties, they had a weird taste to me. I think the seasoning may have been evoking southwest/Mexican flavor profiles but it just wasn't doing it for me. Tasted very off, not bad meat off but ""this seasoning is weird "" off. Now that biscuit....I don't care if you come here for a burger...get you a biscuit on the side! The thing is huge and they serve it with strawberry preserves which I believe are homemade. The whole combo was perfection. I was stuffed and didn't finish half of mine; it was so awesome that the next day I made a little breakfast sandwich with it and my leftover weird sausage and even that couldn't take away from the awesomeness!"
4 star rating,"Only person so i was able to go right in. Of course they were busy. This place is ALWAYS busy. This is maybe my 4th time here, 2nd time alone. Food is always good! My order came out about 20min after giving it. Mimosa & sangria weren't very strong but they aren't meant to be. Ask & you are given a voucher for parking in the financial district garage. Not sure of the length though."
4 star rating,"Wonderful experience at the dime store. Finally got a chance to visit after two unsuccessful attempts on weekends due to very long wait times. Definitely easier to get a spot during the week. Food was deliscious, staff was friendly and the service was quick :) definitely recommend it!"
5 star rating,"Great place for close and cozy breakfast, brunch and conversation. Small plates and great for morning dates. Moderate prices."
5 star rating,"If you don't have reservation be prepared to wait a while. Trust me, it's worth it. Dime Store does breakfast/brunch right. I've only been about three times (so far) but I have never been disappointed. Staff is great but the food is the star of the show. Can't wait to go back. Definitely eat here. Just make sure you have a reservation first to save yourself an hour plus. Or wait the hour, you'll be happy you did."
5 star rating,"We came to the motor city for the packers - lions game. Miss chose this place and we waited 45 minutes....ish and we considered going else where bc we wanted to get to Ford Field when it opened.  Boy, are we glad we waited ! The food, service, & atmosphere are worth the wait ! You won't be disappointed. Miss got the cheesesteak Benny & I got the grilled salmon sandwich with fruit. Wow !!  Just. Wow !!No, they don't take reservations, it is worth the wait. Cheers !"
5 star rating,"Dime Store is a popular breakfast diner in downtown Detroit. After having Sunday breakfast there, I can say it's solid food, but not life changing. Here's our experience:1) Atmosphere: It's a less divey dinner feel with a small seating area inside an office building. There's a mural on the wall of the icon on a dime and bar seating. 2) Food: It was good, but not out of this world. My eggs Benedict and a side of sausage were good, but nothing to come back for. Same with the waffle and my wife's omelet. Solid, but wouldn't run back.3) Service: It was GREAT! We got right in as a party of three around 9:30 a.m. on a Sunday and our server was fast and efficient."
3 star rating,"Such a great, energetic brunch spot with incredibly tasty dishes! The Korean duck hash was delicious and all the other food our party ordered looked amazing as well! We won't hesitate to come back next time we're in town!"
5 star rating,"Dime Store has been on my list of places to try in Detroit for quite some time. My friends and I finally decided to try it for brunch this past weekend. First and foremost, there is a long wait. We were estimated about 80 minutes but really waited 50 minutes(better than 80). When we were finally seated inside you could see how small the place was. It's more of a diner vibe which explains the long wait times. We were seated by the bar and could see all the cooks working hard to get the food out. The cooks are masked which was a bonus especially with new COVID variants coming out. Our waitress was very nice and took our orders very quickly. I ordered the French Toast with fruit which was delicious with a side of Dearborn ham.My friend ordered the sausage hash, which she said was delicious. The only con was that her food wasn't as hot as she was expecting. I also ordered the truffle fries to go and they were so good. Overall all it was a good experience and I'm glad we went. The food came out pretty fast despite how busy the place was."
4 star rating,"This is the place for brunch in Detroit. Coming from multiple sources as highly recommended, Dime Store did not disappoint. While we did have a slight wait, it was beyond worth it. The service, though packed when we went on a Friday morning, was friendly and fast. The coffee was excellent and no problem on the refills. I went with the duck leg hash and my partner went with the breakfast chilaquiles. The duck leg hash, in my opinion is quite possibly the best thing on the menu if you're into savory. There is no shortage of duck, and the glaze and sauce used is SO complex and delicious. I also loved the fry on the potato portion. The chilaquiles were no slouch either. Perfectly spicy and full of flavor! I would love to try a sweet dish here so I guess I'll have to come back next time I'm in Detroit!"
4.5 star rating,"I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant. It has great reviews and there is always a wait on the weekend. Arrived at about 930 am and was told there was an hour wait. We got our table at almost the one hour mark which was great. Our server was fast and efficient, but unfortunately the food was not great. We got biscuits and Gravy, the biscuit itself was delicious but the gravy had a weird flavor. There was also a clear liquid floating on the top of the gravy. For my meal I got the BLT egg sandwich and side salad. It was with lemon vinegarette which just tasted like lemon juice was squeezed on the lettuce. No seasoning or oils. The sandwich was bland and my friends Korean fries came out ice cold. Our waitress did get a replacement for those quite quickly which was nice. Overall I wanted to love this place but I won't be back."
2 star rating,"We stopped in for lunch while doing a holiday shopping wander downtown. I had the corn chowder (delish) and my husband had the chicken tortilla soup (this was more like chili made with chicken). My Bloody Mary was simple and delicious. The salmon sandwich warm, cooked perfectly and served with a generous serving of fresh fruit even though it past fruit season in Michigan. Our server was attentive, nice, welcoming and awesome! Thanks for a great meal and great service."
5 star rating,Stopped in here  for breakfast early on Saturday morning. It was a bit difficult to find as it was in the Chrysler house building. Upon arrival there was about 45 min wait however they got us seated in like 15. So that was great. All of our servers and workers were very friendly and helpful. Very small and quaint inside. But had some cool farmhouse/schoolhouse decor. I personally ordered the classic eggs Benedict. It was very solid. The hollandaise sauce was very good. They ham didn't have much flavor. Egg was good and biscuit was solid as well.  My wife order the peach French toast and she said it was just solid. She was on the fence on it. My oldest daughter got the bacon avocado omelet. She said it was very yummy and the bacon was thick and tasty. My other diabetes got a side of eggs and my second youngest got the waffles. I sampled her waffles and they may have been the best waffles I've ever tasted. Very soft and great flavor on the waffle and the syrup. Very good. Highly recommend that dish. Overall we had a good experience at this establishment. Some of the food was hit and miss. But the foods that we did like was phenomenal. Absolutely worth checking out if in the area and wanting a good breakfast.
4 star rating,"Slow service with an attitude, over priced and under portioned. Lackluster  breakfast."
2 star rating,"If you're looking for a well-seasoned, made from scratch, brunch option in downtown Detroit look no further than locally owned and operated, Dime Store. Nestled on the first floor of the Chrysler House DS is home to some of the most flavorful classic brunch options including the brisket benedict, Brussel sprouts & eggs as well as the peach Frech Toast. The service is phenomenal with only a light wait for food and drinks. I didn't notice any drink or brunch specials but, the Dime Store is thriving nonetheless. Went back and forth about whether this was a 4 or 5-star experience and ultimately landed on 4 because of the long wait (~80 mins for a table of 3)  and lack of wait listing/reservation process in place. With food this good the restaurant HAS to know there needs to be a better system for seating and bussing tables as well as reservations, especially since it's 2021 and this is Detroit. Pro Tip: They validate parking!"

4 star rating,"Oh my gosh Dime Store is the best brunch in Detroit! The menu is creative and flavorful, and the presentation finishes off the details for a perfect brunch. There is an array of Benedicts, waffles, French toast, hash for every palate. Grab a pitcher of mimosas to start your day off right! Make sure you prepare for a worth while wait if trying the Dime Store on the weekends. It's a tiny little gem!"
5 star rating,"3.5! I thought this menu had a lot of options, but I decided on lunch instead of brunch. The people I dined with really liked their brunch options and I liked the sandwich I got, but I don't really think it was anything crazy. It's in a good location though, so if you're hungry you should stop in if there's not too long if a wait!"
3 star rating,"If you get here before 9:45 am there's plenty of seating, any later and expect a wait... a wait that's worth it. They have two Chef specials this week that really need to become staples on their menu. I had their chicken Schwarma hash and my hubby had the pork belly and grits. Both were spot on and so flavorful. The schwarma had all the staple flavors you want and more and the pork belly was so savory and cooked perfectly. We both agreed that pur dishes were the best we've had around Detroit in a minute. Bartender was great, Bloody Mary was spot on. Great staff with great food."
5 star rating,The food n the atmosphere was amazing service was top notch the food was hot n on time even with the restaurant at full capacity
5 star rating,"Stopped in for brunch !  What a great experience.  You can't make reservations but it's worth the wait.  Hard to find parking but they do have parking garages in the area, a little pricey but if your going to walk around and shop Downtown then worth it.   Very classy chic place.  Upbeat and hip place.  The staff was very friendly.  We all ordered a brunch type of food.  Salads - fries eggs with salmon .  Everything was so good.  Very fresh and nice sized portions.  Definitely a great spot to go back to"
4.5 star rating,There aren't many true brunch spots in the city. so Dime Store is definitely a staple. They have good portions and all the brunch classics. They don't take reservations and are often very busy so plan to put your name down and wait around for a bit. There is street parking outside but they also have a parking lot where they validate.
5 star rating,one of the best brunch spots in detroit! dime store has a large menu of typical brunch fare with a unique twist. service is consistently good and parking is validated for the attached garage. the building dime store is in is historic and beautiful and ambience in the restaurant is laid back. definitely worth a trip!
4 star rating,"First time at Dime Store. As a breakfast, lunch, bunch place it's got an eclectic menu that straddles known comfort food and fresh ideas. I had the chicken shawarma hash. Breakfast potatoes, shawarma chicken, tomatoes, onion, eggs, yogurt sauce, cilantro, and pickles. Sounds like a really odd pairing but it was so right together. A take on a local favorite (shawarma). Sooo good. Check out this place if you are in Detroit."
5 star rating,"Unbelievably yummy! I've eaten brunch here a few times. Extremely tasty food. But the downsides are the very long wait (they don't take reservations, so you have to show up in person to put your name on the list) and sometimes the servers can get very, very busy. Don't be disappointed if you don't get a lot of special attention."
4 star rating,"If you get stuck waiting for a passport in downtown Detroit, spend your time wisely and enjoy lunch at The Dime Store!  Great style, friendly staff, and the food was fantastic!  I had the Cubabo sandwich and the Korean BBQ Fries which was more food than I needed for lunch!I have tried Cuban sandwiches other places and haven't been impressed but I would come back for this one!  Just perfectly done - lots of meat and the right balance of pickles and mustard. The side of fries can easily be a meal by themselves, but why not save half the sandwich for later and enjoy both!"
5 star rating,Ate brunch here on Sunday and it was too good! They don't accept reservations but the wait wasn't too bad. I ordered the Korean French fries and asked for a fried egg to be added. OMG it was so yummy!! The chicken sandwich and veggie hash was tasty too. Cocktails are always on point. Love this place!
5 star rating,This was a bit of waiting but the meal was well worth it (around 30 mins during peak). The chorizo omelet I had tasted amazing. The coffee was on pointe. Food came up quick once ordered. Just one tad bit is it can be somewhat cramped on the inside unless you're seating by the bar.
5 star rating,"This place is overrated. Food is mediocre. I had the cheese steak Benny which was not bad with the breakfast potatoes which were over cooked and just not good. I threw them away. My husband ordered the Sante Fe omelette which did not taste seasoned at all. I tried my sisters grits which were actually pretty good (and I'm picky about my grits). Overall, For this to be a black-owned establishment, I am very surprised at the lack of flavor."
3 star rating,The best  place for breakfast is now the best place for lunch!The soups were both great and the BLTE was awesome!
5 star rating,Atmosphere and space is interesting. Friendly and fast service. Cheesesteak benny is yummy and so are the house fries.
5 star rating,"Absolutely loved this restaurant. I was visiting Detroit for the NCAA wrestling tournament. The first morning a few of us went here and I had the best omelet I can ever remember having. Housemade sausage, fontina cheese, peppers, onions, and cooked to perfection. The next day some people wanted to eat at the hotel for convenience. OK, but what a let down after eating at Dime Store. So day three my wife and I avoided the group and came back to Dime Store. This time it was one of their hashes (also with the housemade sausage). When it came out I thought ""that is too much food, I won't be able to finish it"", but I sent back an empty plate in the end. It was too good to stop.The service was also topnotch. They were hustling and very friendly. At one point I was looking around for our waitress to get a coffee re-fill and one of the other waitresses noticed and asked if there was anything I needed. A little touch that goes a long way.A tiny place, but to me that is part of the charm. Almost felt like you are visiting a friend's place for breakfast."
4.5 star rating,"Great food.  Not boring menu selections lots of creative items.  Pricey and crowded and a bit slow at times, but worth the wait and the price."
5 star rating,"I love coming her for lunch! Great atmosphere, for food and service! I've gotten the b.l.t.e sandwich and chicken avocado salad - both were amazing! The Spicy Korean fries are terrific if you want to add some more flavor and fun to your meal!"
5 star rating,"I ordered the corned beef and hash with eggs.   Food was very tasty.   Coffee was so-so.  Server was great!   We Parked on the street in front of the building.  We paid $1.50 to park.  You need to get out of your car and go into the building, this cafe is in the corner, not visible from the street."
5 star rating,"This place was packed mid-morning on a Saturday, so we placed a to-go order and ate at Campus Martius. We got the cheesesteak benny and the housemade sausage hash, with a side of fresh fruit. We would definitely get it all again. This was probably the best breakfast/brunch we've had in our four months living in the area. If we lived closer, we would go all the time. But until then, it will be a destination for us whenever we're downtown!"
5 star rating,i love it there food is great and i love they kept it clean
5 star rating,"Delicious and great menu. Bennies were delicious, loved the fried green tomato, wish there was a smidge more pimento cheese, will request next time. Everything was really fresh, and I love that you can get choice of hash brown potatoes, side salad, or fruit on the side for the brunch stuff. Sometimes you want hash browns, sometimes you want truffle fries. Lots of brunch and lunch choices, salads or sandwiches."
5 star rating,"This place is small and the wait can be a tad long especially on a Sunday. It's definitely worth it. They do not take reservations so get there early. The menu has many options and adult drinks! We got the peach mimosa pitcher....it's was soooo good. The breakfast potatoes were the best, they were chopped up small and had lots of flavor. The staff was very busy but efficient and friendly."
5 star rating,"Usually when there's a 35 minute wait for a table at 1115a on a Monday in Downtown Detroit, that would indicate something special.  And when the wait is up to 90 minutes when you leave, something is probably truly legit. And it WAS.Super fresh ingredients, perfectly ripe avocado, great coffee and an impeccable food presentation. The housemade sausage is out of this world. Stellar Detroit breakfast."
5 star rating,"If i could start my day with dime store everyday... i would! i got the veggie hash and coffee and it was delish. The veggie hash was a great amount of food. i love breakfast foods so im always looks for a big plate and this filled me up. the flavors were amazing. this place is know for being busy with a long wait because it's smaller inside which i like. nice and cozy. i had two other people with me and we went on sunday at 8:30AM and there was no wait! don't expect to have the same experience at prime brunch time of 10 or 11, there was a long wait when we walked out. play your cards right and the dime store will definitely win you over."
5 star rating,"I recently revisited the Dime Store. This experience was by far better than the first. This was a very good experience from the service to the food! My family and I ordered food from the Brunch, Lunch, and Chef's Special menu selections. All of the options were well prepared and tasty. They also have very good coffee.  The energy is alway vibrant and expect to wait a minimum of 45 minutes, as tvis is, rightfully so, a popular spot. I'd definitely recommend for Breakfast, Brunch, or Lunch."
4.5 star rating,"Well worth the wait! A wonderful atmosphere with exceptional food and service! (Shoutout to Kelly for being amazing!) A small spot nestled in the Chrysler Building not to be missed by travelers. We were visiting from Indianapolis and got some of the most popular dishes; Cheesesteak Benny and fresh fruit for me and Duck Hash for my partner. The Benny was amazing, and trust me, I know a good Benny. But the real star of the show was the duck!Sweet juicy and perfectly tender, DO NOT MISS OUT!We also tried several beverages including iced and hot Irish coffee (hot won) as well as the Orange Creamsicle and freshly squeezed lemonade."
5 star rating,"The dime store is a good brunch place that's servers breakfast and lunch =brunch. (Lol)  this resturant normally have a long wait time. When I say long I'm talking about an hour long. So if you feel like waiting to eat go for it. Wish this location offered a service where I could just check in on my phone instead of checking in at the resturant. Now, when it comes to the food it's not bad prices range between ($10-$25) With a pitcher of mimosa costing about  $30 dollars.  Well I hope you enjoy your visit at the dime store."
4 star rating,Cold-smoked salmon Benny was amazing.Seated at the bar after 10-15 minutes during lunch on a busy weekday (April 2019). Our waitress was nice enough to tell us a little of the history even though they were busy (and it was crazy loud). Turns out the restaurant is located in an old dime bank where it used to cost 10 cents to open an account. There are still vaults downstairs.
5 star rating,"At first I was super excited to eat here. I waited a little over an hour. When we sat we ordered a few minutes after our server greeted us. However, we waited about a hour and more for our food. When the tables around us receive their food but came after us. We then were concerned and asked to speak to our waited that never came back to check in with us only to bring us a set of drinks. She checked on the tables around us but now with us. After everyone around us got their meals, we finally got our. My french toast came out first, it was cold to the touch. Then the bacon came out and it was cold to the touch and lastly the eggs came out and they were cold as well. Shortly after speaking to someone they brought me new french toast. That was also cold. On the third attempt she stated ""thats as hot as it will allow"". Which was a bit offensive because if I am paying for a service, at minimum the food should be hot or even warm. There should be no reason I have to check on my food several times to ensure it is done correctly. This was actually one of the worst experiences I have had in Detroit. As excited as I was, the over all experience with this establishment is subpar. The lack of customer service, empathy, kindness was appalling. Hope the next time I visit it can be a different experience!!!"
1 star rating,"Went back home to visit family and friends over the weekend and my friends raved about the Dime Store. I knew I had to check them out. This is a black-owned cute little brunch spot in the heart of downtown Detroit. I was so excited to see the variety on the menu and one of my favorite brunch items are eggs benedict. They had a lot of different eggs benedict options on their menu. My friend and I both ordered a different type of eggs benedict - my friend ordered the Cheesesteak Benedict and I ordered the chilaquiles eggs benedict. They both came with a side of fried potatoes. We also got some delicious French toast to share that was on the list of chef specials but I can't quite remember the name. I do remember that it had a delicious lemon curd and fresh raspberries. We really loved it. I'll certainly be visiting again when I come back home to Detroit! My friends and family let me know that their menu changes often and I love that about these quaint brunch places. The menu feels inspired by the seasons which is awesome. I will say though- The best thing about this place is the staff. Everyone we met, from the hostess to our waitress, was so very pleasant I made us smile and laugh. I can't say enough good things about this place!"
5 star rating,"Detroit is an interesting city -- culinary options are fairly limited. We wanted brunch and Dime Store had amazing reviews; figured we might as well try it. The wait was almost three hours--at this point, I'm thinking this place better be mind-blowing delicious. Their menu was basic, nothing imaginative. Food was passable for a diner. Drink options were limited. I'm glad I tried it so I can understand the hype. But, Detroit has to have better options right?"
2 star rating,We stopped in Dime Store while in Detroit. This place is a solid 5! We got there just in time for only an hour wait. The wait was up to two hours. The restaurant is a little small and capacity is still at about 50%. The Decor was cute and the staff extremely accommodating. There is also a full bar so of course we ordered a cocktail for Brunch. I opted out of the usual Mimosa and ordered a Lafayette Lemonade...can you say yum! It was delicious and refreshing. Now let's get to the food! OMG! We ordered the Lemon/Berry Brioche French Toast. It was delicious and flavorful. NOW if you love Sausage you HAVE GOT TO TRY the Homemade Sausage!! TO DIE FOR! I'm not a lover of sausage but this is hands down the best sausage I've ever had. We tried to purchase a couple of pounds to take home. LOL didn't work. After eating we totally understood the 2 hour wait.
5 star rating,"Excellent location, great diner! Poached eggs on the eggs Benedict were perfect! Sausage hash was super yummy. Loved the proximity to downtown sights."
5 star rating,"Great service, Kari was really nice, an great waitress!Love my Duck Pod, it was amazing lots of flavors. The remaining of our meal was normal. The wait was about 1.5 hours, worth trying."
4 star rating,"Amazing meal. Went with a friend and we had delicious peach mimosas and both had the hash. 10/10 would recommend. The following week we went back and had egg bennys and a waffle, also delicious. Chai tea latte was also very tasty and comforting. This place is really a good spot to hit in Detroit."
4.5 star rating,"I tried Dime Store this past weekend for the very first time for a brunch takeout & brought it back to the hotel we were getting ready at for a wedding. As we were placing the order, I was really excited about this menu! There seem to be so many great options that I was interested in trying that I'm eager to go back to try! Two of us got different kinds of their eggs benedict and I was very impressed that even with a takeout order, the poached eggs were still deliciously runny when we finally got to our hotel to eat them! My smoked salmon benny was DELICIOUS! I love a quality eggs benedict!My main complaints that with such a big order we place (food for 4 people), our takeout order came with 0 utensils! Dime Store, surely you don't expect that everyone (or even the majority of people) are taking this food to go directly home where they have a plethora of utensils at their disposal? We had to get really creative with how to eat our food, which hampered the experience a bit! My other complaint was that the fresh fruit side we had ordered was underwhelming - a lot of basic, cheap fruits like orange slices, grapes, apple slices, all not entirely ripe. I wouldn't recommend wasting money on getting this side."
4 star rating,This place was the BOMB! Best breakfast that we've had in forever! Service was amazing from the hostess all the way through. Thank you! Keep it up.
5 star rating,"According to Reviews.com, this is the best restaurant in our state. They go only by the number of reviews and the average rating. Well, here's another 5 star! We went on a weekday morning and didn't have to wait at all. Looking around and seeing how spaced out the tables are, between the bar spots and tables I counted about 20 seats total. So I can see how there could be a long wait on a weekend.It's in a historic building that was built between 1910 and 1912, and used to be called the Dime Building. That's just a little history lesson, which explains the cute name of the restaurant. It was easy to find based on another review here, that mentioned it was in the Chrysler House Building. We were able to get a metered parking spot, but there's also a parking garage nearby.The service was friendly, and the menu had some unique items. I finally decided on the homemade sausage hash. It was SO good! It said it came with spicy ketchup. The ketchup was actually drizzled on top, and I didn't find it very spicy (which is good for me). I had enough leftovers to take home a decent amount of hash, which I had the next day with a fried egg on top and some of my own drizzled ketchup to try to recreate what I had.My husband had a classic eggs benedict and said it was excellent. He knows good food, so I believe him!I'm so glad we tried this place. Great atmosphere and menu, really good food, and friendly service.  I'd definitely come back here."
5 star rating,"Definitely a classic brunch spot for me! It's never easy to get a table here unless you're willing to wait for at least 30 mins. But great food, lovely vibe and definitely the nicest view from here."
4 star rating,LOVED Dime Store!!  best veggie omelette and hash browns I have ever eaten!  Seriously. Waitstaff was amazing. Full house on a Monday 9:40a   Want to go back and try lunch!!  Don't miss.
5 star rating,"This place was amazing!! My husband and I were staying at the Westin hotel for my birthday, and we were looking for a nice place to get brunch. The food had amazing flavor, the biscuit had a hint of sweetness and tasted homemade absolutely delicious. The Cheesesteak Benny was perfectly done, the Korean fries had great flavor. I loved the vanilla chai latte. It was well worth the wait for sure. We ended up going back a second time! Highly recommend!"
5 star rating,The food here is divine. Everything was yummy and fresh. Make sure you go early and arrive on time because it gets filled up quickly and you can't be seated until your entire party arrives. Service was okay and professional.
5 star rating,"Everything was so good, even French fries tasted so yummy! This place was my first stop at Detroit and I'm glad, we had a good start for our trip"
5 star rating,"Just wow. Everything. So good. Great service, amazing food. The Duck bop was insane. The mimosas were strong and delicious. The wait was long, but you can go somewhere else while you wait. They text you when your table is ready."
5 star rating,"Busy place-- popped in for one and waited 20 minutes for a seat at the bar. Bustling, busy diner, but staff was available and service moved quickly with lots of coffee refills. Downtown Detroit with all of the office folks-- easiest for me to park in the garage a block away. Big breakfast portions -- not oily or salty (my biggest complaints about diners). Worth the wait!"
4.5 star rating,Great breakfast place food is awesome polite staff and of course Great bloody Mary
5 star rating,"There are a lot of excellent brunch places. Pancakes, french toast, and eggs aren't that hard, right? Well, Dime Store is at the top of the game, but that alone isn't enough for five stars. In today's economy? You need a little more. Dime Store earns those five stars for not only having excellent food, but excellent service. Kudos to them, you have one happy customer here."
5 star rating,"Was really looking forward to brunch after reviewing the menu and reviews! Not worth the hour wait, food was decent-but got delivered cold. Our server was wonderful and very attentive. She replaced my cold meal immediately for fresh, hot food, but still wasn't impressed. Although service was good, would not wait an hour+ to eat."
3 star rating,A lovely modern brunch spot that I will definitely be back to! I had their fired chicken & biscuit sandwich ... so good. Will always return when I want breakfast in the city
5 star rating,"This place is delightful.  I'm a sucker for a cool, retro, converted space.  My spouse and I shared the Ginger Eggnog French Toast and the Corned Beef Omelette and a couple of beverages and they were all very good.  Enjoyed it all very much!"
4 star rating,"Worth the wait. 2 +hours. I had the salmon Benny, sister has the cheese steak Benny and cousin has the French toast, and 2 bloodys. All delicious and the service was great."
5 star rating,"While the wait is long, the food and service completely make up for it! This is by far one of my favorite brunch spots to go to. They ensure that seating is distant enough to allow for comfort and social distancing."
4 star rating,"This spot was such an amazing find.  Well, I shouldn't say ""find,"" because the woman who invited me had obviously been here before and knew it was just right.We came pretty early on a Saturday afternoon, and was seated after only 20 minutes.  The waiting area was very nice, and my guest and I had fun lounging around talking while we waited.Once seated we were met by a very enthusiastic waiter.  I'm upset that I no longer know the gentlemen's name, but he went ABOVE & BEYOND!He was energetic, but NOT in that annoying TGIF restaurant way.  It was natural and authentic.  The waiter ensured that my friend and I had ample time to look over the menu.  I asked for a Pellegrino, which they either didn't carry or were out of.I ordered the Grilled Chicken Salad and my friend ordered the Duck Bop.  Both dishes were exquisitely crafted (see the photos), and tasted fantastic.As we were getting ready to leave this amazing waiter brought over a Pellegrino.  I said, ""I thought you were didn't have any,"" to which he responded, ""We don't.  I walked down the street to buy you one.  It's on me.""  Not only is the food here amazing, but this man is a shining example of customer service at it's finest.  IF I find the receipt with his name I will amend this review, so that the owners of this establishment can (hopefully) give this server a raise, and that readers of this review can request him when going to Dime Store, which I highly suggest you do."
5 star rating,"I  have to chime in, in spite of 1000+ reviews, I have to say (and there won't be any photos, you'll just have to trust me, friends . . .), W O W !!!!Hubbs and I walked over Sunday morning around 9 and the wonderful cafe was full, but diners were coming and going in a quick, orderly fashion. What was most impressive was the lovely hostess who greeted us with a smile and told us our table was almost ready,  the check was being paid and she'd let us know when we could go in. In the meantime, the droolworthy menu was there for us to preview. I know there was a lunch menu on the back, but I never got beyond trying to decide on breakfast. EVERYTHING sounded DELISH.Once to the table, our waitress, Katy, was pleasant and efficient. Waters and coffees came right away and the coffees were refilled with cheerfulness. Zingerman's roasts the dark roast just for the cafe, according to our waitress, and in spite of normally preferring medium, Hubbs and I loved our coffee and it was perfect with no cream.Salmon benny for Hubbs - -he wishes the smoked salmon had been warm, but still raved about his plate. We shared a side of fruit that was decent (nutrition, friends) and I had . . .drum roll, please . . .. the duck bop hash. O. Wowwie. Yum. My only criticism was that the duck hash (more of a pulled duck) was too juicy . . .I would have liked to have had a slotted spoon employed by the excellent cook who must have been multitasking like a mother. Ha. But the flavor . . .the eggs, over easy were cooked to perfection, there was a bit of pickled veg atop, some cilantro, sriracha . . .the spice was nice. I simply adored Dime Store from the minute we walked into the gorgeous building that houses it. The crowd was diverse and lively. Everyone, including the servers, seemed happy. Can't think of a better way to slide into the end of the weekend and start a Sunday right. Thanks, Dime Store!!!!!"
5 star rating,"So he has been here before and didn't care for the food. But he was willing to give it another try because I really wanted some mimosas and he wants to make me happy. So we took a walk to the Dime Store. We were told there would be a 45 min wait. The restaurant was practicing social distancing and there were not a lot of tables there, so that made sense. We had all day and we were not in any type of hurry so we put our names in and walked down to the bar ""The Athens"" for a beer while we waited. It was only about 20 min before we got our call that our table was ready. We came back and were seated in a little cut out area that felt very private. The hostess and the waiter were both very sweet. We ordered drinks. I got my mimosa with Grenadine and he ordered an orange creamsicle. His drink tasted like ice cream! We ordered another and then waited to have our order taken. After about 20 min the waiter came back and said he was looking for our food and realized we hadn't ordered yet. No biggie. He placed our order and we for more delicious drinks. This was really starting to take a long time but we were patient. The waiter came back with my peach cobbler waffle and explained that there was something wrong with his food (the manager didn't like how the potatoes looked) and they were going to re do it. Ok. Better than serve bad food right? So we shared my waffle. It was absolutely delicious.... We finished our waffle and we sat. And sat.. finally, he asked how much longer and the waiter said 15 min.  We decided just to  cancel the food. It was such a long time. The manager came over and bought us a drink and actually offered to take care of the whole bill. We wouldn't allow that. The fact that he offered was very sweet though. Overall it was a good experience. Wish the food wasn't an issue but the manager did try to resolve it. I'm pretty sure we will give it a third try because my waffle was delicious! Off to our next destination!"
4.5 star rating,Could not believe how clean they kept their kitchen!  Social distancing and awesome food.  The wait for the 3 was around 45 minut a.
5 star rating,"Everything that I ate was delicious. It also should now be understated that whatever your wait is, its likely worth it. It is kid friendly, from the mom that has 22 years of experience as a parent, to the waitress that was willing to get my son (11 months) a fruit cup while we waited."
5 star rating,"After some favorable nods from friends, a couple of friends and I dropped in for an early Sunday brunch during a recent trip. We made it just before the rush, and were seated immediately. A bloody mary requested spicy was delivered as ordered, and served in a non fussy presentation. For the main course, I ordered the ""spicy belly"" benedict, featuring seared pork belly and jalapeno pesto on a fresh baked biscuit, and of course, the usual hollandaise and poached eggs. The pork belly was tender and delicious, and the eggs were properly cooked. A little less inspiring were the house breakfast potatoes (subbed for the salad); these were small cubes which could have used more browning and were a little cold. My fellow diners enjoyed their meals and the strength of the pork belly and eggs portion of the benedict props this review up to four stars. I'd definitely try this place again on a return visit."
4 star rating,"Dime Store is a must visit when you are in downtown Detroit.  I knew they were gonna be busy so I visited as soon as they were open.  I sat at the bar, got served by an awesome male bartender.  I told him it was my first time in Detroit and he told me all the places I shpuld go visit and how to get there.  The chef who made my food was really nice too.  My eyes were way bigger than my stomach so I ordered the strawberry french toast and half sized bacon cheese truffle fries with a side of chai latte.  My god everything was excellent!!  The portion js quite big so I took the left over back to my hotel, ate it cold...still tasty!   I am definitely coming back here if I ever am back in Detroit and try something else :)"
5 star rating,Came back to experience this deliciousness again after the Breast Cancer Walk having worked up an appetite. I'm on my own and was told 35-40 minute wait. I'm more than happy to sit for a spell at this point. We come to an hour later and it's oh you missed when we called you. Then waited an additional 20 minutes on top of that during which I had to stand to ensure I actually heard someone this time. Food and service here is impeccable so I will continue to return. I'm quite disenchanted by the host/hostess area and the expectation set by them for a wait and making sure seating is handled appropriately. Had to deduct a star for this.

4 star rating,Had the opportunity to attend brunch here with some friends. We shared half orders of the Spicy Korean and Bacon Parm Truffle fries to start. I then indulged in the Bacon Avocado omelette with a Peach Mimosa. It was an excellent experience. Great atmosphere and music.
5 star rating,"What a find!  First, the staff was super friendly and helped with great suggestions for meals.  The food was outstanding and the menu options were terrific!  The duck bop hash was so delicious!  If you visit downtown Detroit and don't eat here, you made a mistake!"
5 star rating,"Yum! Fantastic food, great options! Christina was the best, great suggestions and super upbeat! I had the veggie Benny, delicious!"
5 star rating,"I was really looking forward to this place since we had tried on so many times but the wait was too long.  We finally went on a Monday at 10:00 so the wait wasn't that bad.  I ordered a Belgian waffle.  It came cold.  The butter wouldn't spread and the cold syrup did nothing to help.  I sent it back and they made a new one. My husband ordered the CB hash that was very underwhelming.  The meat was like sliced lunch meat. The side potatoes were kinda undercooked, doused in a seasoning similar to Slap yo Mama.  My son ordered an omelette that was small and tough (overcooked).   Really disappointed.  I've had way better breakfasts at actual Dime Store counters."
3 star rating,"Delicious and worth the wait, which generally goes faster than it sounds."
5 star rating,"If you live around Detroit, then you have no doubt heard of Dime Store. After hearing and reading recommendations of this place for years, I finally tried it out. I somehow ended up here on a Saturday morning during what I would think would be prime time, but I must have arrived during the perfect window, because we didn't have to wait more than a few minutes. With all the hoopla around this place, it was not what I expected. When you hear of something being the best brunch spot in the city and located in a big building downtown, somehow casual and cramped was not what my mind conjured. I definitely was thinking this would be a white tablecloth kind of restaurant - neither that was definitely not the case. Instead it is cute, eclectic, but most definitely cramped. But none of that matters because the food is so outstanding and lovingly prepared.  I ordered a seasonal dish - the key lime pie French toast, which turned out to be out of this world. I haven't been able to get that dish out of my mind for two months. Dime Store - if you're reading this - please, please, please add that dish to your menu permanently! I must have it again some day.My parents ordered the spicy belly benny and the smoked salmon breakfast sandwich and both were very pleased with their choices. We'll be back soon - maybe this weekend if I have my UPDATE - NOV 2019Had two of the specials of the month - Bananas Foster French Toast and Turkey Gobbler Benny. Both dishes were excellent with top notch presentation. The Turkey Gobbler was definitely a unique approach to eggs benedict. The French Toast was so good that it tasted more like bread pudding."

4.5 star rating,"What a great little find with amazing food! The waitstaff was very attentive and the recommendations were spot on! Hands down the best meal of our group was the Cheesesteak Eggs Benedict! You will most likely need to put your name on a waitlist, but is totally worth the wait!"
5 star rating,"Unbelievable food, this place is tiny like 8 tables so unless you're there right at opening expect to wait. The service and our server were awesome! Definitely will be coming back! We had an omelette with potatoes that were cooked and seasoned perfect and their waffles."
5 star rating,"Ordered carry out today, quoted a very quick 15-20 mins. When I went in to pick it up, you could tell that they were very busy. 1-1/2 wait for dine in I overheard. With that being said, the carry out was awesome! You could tell that they put care into each order even when they are busy, which is rare for restaurants. The food was great and filling for an extremely reasonable price!"
5 star rating,"The hostess was nice and recommended an area to check out nearby while we waited. The service was great, the gal serving us gave us refills when needed. The food was really good. We had lunch and breakfast, the omelette was great. Would definitely come back here, and highly recommend."
5 star rating,"Unbelievably good! It's worth the hour or hour and a half wait. The food is delicious, fresh, and well made! If I leave a 30% tip, it means I'm more than pleased with the staff, service and meal!"
5 star rating,Cold-smoked salmon Benny was amazing.Seated at the bar after 10-15 minutes during lunch on a busy weekday (April 2019). Our waitress was nice enough to tell us a little of the history even though they were busy (and it was crazy loud). Turns out the restaurant is located in an old dime bank where it used to cost 10 cents to open an account. There are still vaults downstairs.
5 star rating,Long wait on weekends. 1 and 45 Min and more. Lemon blueberry pancakes were way too sweet. Me and my friend couldn't finish them. Eggs were bland and tasted like they cracked an egg shell in there. Potato Hash was too hard and crunchy to finish. Overall just ok.
1 star rating,"Stopped in for brunch !  What a great experience.  You can't make reservations but it's worth the wait.  Hard to find parking but they do have parking garages in the area, a little pricey but if your going to walk around and shop Downtown then worth it.   Very classy chic place.  Upbeat and hip place.  The staff was very friendly.  We all ordered a brunch type of food.  Salads - fries eggs with salmon .  Everything was so good.  Very fresh and nice sized portions.  Definitely a great spot to go back to"
5 star rating,"Outstanding!! The food was great, cooked perfectly with generous portions. Excellent service as well!!"
5 star rating,"Great service, Kari was really nice, an great waitress!Love my Duck Pod, it was amazing lots of flavors. The remaining of our meal was normal. The wait was about 1.5 hours, worth trying."
4.5 star rating,"4.5 stars. Wowowow, does it get busy here! And for good reason, breakfast here is amazing. I waited about an hour and a half to be seated when I came on a Sunday afternoon. Don't fret, they have seating outside the restaurant, or you can walk around downtown and explore during your wait time. Since the wait was long, I decided on what I would get beforehand, which was the housemade sausage hash. It was filling and was both savory and sweet due to the sauce it came with. I just wish it came out warmer. The Korean fries came out hot and were quite delicious. The same ingredients in the fries were also in the Korean bbq sandwich, which my boyfriend got and enjoyed. Although it is located downtown, parking isn't horrible. They can validate your parking for two hours at the Financial District garage, but since the wait time is so long, you'll likely end up spending more than two hours there and will still have to pay a few bucks for parking.Overall, Dime Store did not disappoint my brunch cravings! I know that is one of the most popular restaurants in Detroit, and they definitely live up to it."
4 star rating,"I've frequented Dime Store many times and it's one of my favorite brunch spots.The GOOD: I've tried all the benedicts - all are good! In my opinion, the Spicy Belly is their absolute best (albeit my review picture has the philly version - also good). All are served with a lightly dressed salad - much prefer this over their potatoes. Have also tried their Truffle fries and Spicy Korean fries - VERY good! What really keeps me coming in so frequent are their baristas. Hands-down they make the absolute best Vanilla Latte I've EVER had. Made with Zingerman's coffee and they use real vanilla bean - no syrup. The bad: There is always a lengthy wait on the weekend. Expect to wait no less than an hour. Better to come in as a smaller group of 3 or less and you can get seated quicker. They will also not seat you if your entire party is not present (i.e. if someone is parking the car it does not matter, they won't seat you). TLDR: Order the spicy korean fries, the spicy belly eggs benedict, and wash it down with a vanilla latte. Staff is awesome any time I've been in, but prepared for a wait because it's always poppin' (the sign of a good spot)!"
4 star rating,The duck bop was absolutely I'm incredible! Sorry I forgot to take a picture but take my word for it.. AMAZING
5 star rating,"Amazing brunch today.  There was about a 40 minute wait on a Saturday at 9:30am for 2, but so worth it.  The food was fabulous and the service was excellent.  It's also nice to have dedicated parking in downtown Detroit.  So, take advantage of parking in the Financial Center garage that they validate for since it's right around the corner.  We had the Duck Bop Hash and the Chef's special Chilaquiles Benny.  Both were so good!  This will be our go to brunch spot from now on!!!"

5 star rating,Place is overratedPotatoes were right out of the bag...frozen. Avocado Benny was OK. Dive diners have a better ambience than this place which is in the storefront of an old office building. OK. But lower your expectations.
3 star rating,The wait was really long.. I think we waited about two hours.. However.. Once seated.. The server was sweet.. I dint remember her name (sorry). But she was nice.. And super helping in suggesting what was a must try...  We are visiting the this great state of Michigan from Sunny California.  We ordered the bacon parmesan fries.. And OMFG those were the star of our brunch!   Two thumbs all the way up to chefs..  The rest of the breakfast was good too.. Really it was not those fries.. I mean wowzas!!!   We waited a really long time... But once seated.. We got the food and drinks really fast.. So that was awesome!  Thank you to all employees at this place you guys ROCK!
5 star rating,"After trying to eat here for what seems like forever...we finally had breakfast here and it was awesome! Loved there daily specials: a Korean bbq chicken thigh, slaw, hash and (we requested) soft scrambled eggs. It's was . The strawberry French toast was perfect. A thick cut bread that was perfectly cooked, a little custardy but not mushy"
5 star rating,"First time diner with a not so thrilled experience with the HOSTESS re their policy on first come, first served seating. Long and short, our party size went from 20 to 12 after a 1:45hr wait!! Beyond irritated with her as she had no empathy for seating as she's clearly dealt with ""situations like mine"" with no concern. Mgt was team hostess, so no (real) help there... The saving grace was the food was delicious, service was great and prices were decent! Not sure about returning anytime soon...glad I can check that Detroit location off of my list."
2 star rating,"Couldn't have been any more disappointing in my opinion. The wait was about an hour and when we were finally sat to order drinks, I was told that theY don't carry Goose, a full bar with no Goose? -_-' I had an awful martini, with limes that you couldn't get juice out of to save your life (super dry). I was up charged for ""Ciroc"" vodka the same price it would've been for the goose and it tasted awful, not happy with that. My friends all didn't like their drinks either. They had sangrias and mimosas. I ordered a tomato soup cup. The soup Did not have any flavor, it was in a mug and arrived to me cold & had barely any cheese on it. My friends ordered eggs Benedict and I tried a bite and it was good. The eggs were poached perfectly, I'll give them that. The view and casual/hipster ambiance of this brunch  spot in the beautiful building really helped though. It's very tight in there, everyone is touching everyone but it is kinda cute. Our server was nice enough but i wouldn't ever come back."
4.5 star rating,"The food was really good, but if you go on weekend be prepared for 2 hour wait for table. We took the to ho route and had our food within 30 mins. We were lucky to grab one of the cafe tables in the lobby."
4 star rating,Amazing brunch. Definitely go. It's a quaint and cozy location with a lot of charm and great food!!!
5 star rating,"My favorite restaurant in Detroit. I love the concept of this restaurant as a brunch bar where you can enjoy great food and alcohol. I got the Duck Bop Hash which was amazing! The sweet, spicy, and salty balance of the sweet pickles, onion, and sriracha was well executed. The duck leg was cooked perfectly and the potatoes and eggs were very good! I have been here for lunch as well and enjoyed it. It's good to find a place where you have never tasted a bad or average meal. Well done, Dime Store! I'll be back to visit!"
5 star rating,"If I could give them a 6 star review I would!! It was an AMAZING experience all around from the hostess, our server Nicole to the staff and of course the food was AWESOME!! Amazing and it was our first time there traveling in from Ohio. I am going back tomorrow again! Highly recommend going!! Keep up the phenomenal work during these trying times! Cheers"
5 star rating,"I have been here many times, and overall I like the atmosphere, and the food is unique. Between the Korean fries and duck rueben, you can't go wrong. The staff is always very nice but because they are busy on occasion service is a little slow. One small issue is that the place tends to get very congested not just with people but with the smell of cooking. The ventilation clearly is an issue which results in you leaving smelling like whatever is being cooked that day.  Overall definitely worth stopping in."
4 star rating,"Unbelievably good! It's worth the hour or hour and a half wait. The food is delicious, fresh, and well made! If I leave a 30% tip, it means I'm more than pleased with the staff, service and meal!"
5 star rating,The Veggie Benny is surprisingly very good! Really enjoyed that as well as the Belgium Waffles.
5 star rating,"Rude. Rude. Rude. Was yelled at the the hostess as I gave my name at the stand. She yelled ""now!!"" Giving my party about 30 seconds to be seated. So rude."
1 star rating,An unexpected pleasant surprise.  Excellent service and the food was divine!! I had the duck has browns and my cousin had the grits.  We were both very happy.
5 star rating,"The hostess was nice and recommended an area to check out nearby while we waited. The service was great, the gal serving us gave us refills when needed. The food was really good. We had lunch and breakfast, the omelette was great. Would definitely come back here, and highly recommend."
4.5 star rating,Good value. Food is adequate. Nothing special but hey. It's breakfast food.  Ambiance is nice. Will take others there if they like breakfast but personally just not my thing.
4 star rating,Amazing food everytime I go! Really enjoy my experience here the only negative is that it's so popular the wait time is usually an hour.
5 star rating,Long wait on weekends. 1 and 45 Min and more. Lemon blueberry pancakes were way too sweet. Me and my friend couldn't finish them. Eggs were bland and tasted like they cracked an egg shell in there. Potato Hash was too hard and crunchy to finish. Overall just ok.
1 star rating,"Outstanding!! The food was great, cooked perfectly with generous portions. Excellent service as well!!"
5 star rating,"I have walked by this restaurant at least a dozen times, on the first floor of the Chrysler building downtown. I have always noticed its busy, there is almost always a line of people...  So, it shouldnt have been a surprise that this hip diner is magnificent. However, we were pleasantly surprised.The staff here, showcases true teamwork. They seem to run this tiny space with fun and ease. Its a well oiled machine from the hostess, to the waitress to the guys and girls manning  the stove top/grill behind the bar. My latte was pure perfection, I even forgave the simple mug with their corporate logo. Eggs were perfectly poached, smothered in rich hollandaise sauce, good portion of duck and served with a refreshing side salad. My husband ordered a burger and was equally satisfied. We found a new brunch spot in Detroit and cant wait to come back to try one of their craft sandwiches.  Definitely worth 300 dimes for both of us!"
5 star rating,"After hearing all the hype of this restaurant, we visited for brunch one Saturday with friends and it definitely held up to my expectations. If you're going for brunch, expect a wait as this is a popular place to visit. However, as it is located inside the Chrysler House in Detroit you have indoor seating outside the restaurant to wait for your table and restrooms nearby. Once inside the Dime Store, the restaurant boasts a hip, quaint vibe. Staff was very friendly and pleasant conversation was had. Mimosas and Bloody Mary's are available for brunch, as well as delicious lattes in old-school diner style mugs. I ordered one of the Chef Specials--Strawberry Stuffed French Toast, which included chocolate ganache, whipped cream and strawberries. Delicious! Definitely a brunch spot to check out with a large variety of delicious lunch and breakfast options!"
4 star rating,You HAVE to get the duck bop. So so good. Full of flavor with a little kick. Christina H was also such a great server
5 star rating,"An office favorite. A destination everyone should have on their radar, even if you are traveling through Detroit for the day. This is THE daytime spot. This is the spot you recommend to your parents, your professor, the Aunt who has taste and the mother-in-law you want to impress... Rubbed shoulders with red wings players, dined across from some piston players, saw our local anchorman, and many more familiar faces that any Detroiter would recognize. Strictly a brunch/ lunch place. Ambiance is on point, and nestle in as this place is tight... literally small, so plan ahead if you are more than 4. I believe they do NOT take reservations. Hasn't been a dish I have not liked, but love the potatoes with the hash, which is a personal favorite. (Bring back the pork belly hash!!!!!) Duck bop is good too. Coffee is from zingermans... and if you know, you know...This is not a coney, so be prepared to spend $$ for their brunch/ lunch ~ 15-20 usually a person. Also don't expect to be sat right away if you come around noon... this place is hoping. Be prepared to share a four top with another two top in peak hours. Hint- if you like cheesesteaks order theirs and add truffle mayo (dollar more). I have to say... one of the best cheesesteaks in town.  Waitress recommended it just today and said it's one of the most ordered dishes. My only gripe about this place is the chairs... like nails on a chalkboard when someone tries to push them out or in. One of the most uncomfortable sounds imaginable and I clench my jaw just thinking about it. Please please please pad those up on the bottom."
5 star rating,"I've been wanting to come here for a while, but I could never seem to squeeze in a visit until now. I was down here on a random Saturday morning for a doctors appointment and took my chances and stopped in.Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised! I knew this place was good from the reviews, but I had to see it for myself. Walking in, you enter through a general lobby of a building, so there's plenty of seating and a large waiting area. Thank goodness, because the place was packed! I put my name in and was seated at the bar about 15 minutes later.I reviewed the menu and was unsure of what to get. I knew I wanted breakfast, but nothing really looked familiar. I chatted with the bartender, who was really super friendly despite this place being jammed to the gills. He recommended the Philly Cheesesteak eggs benedict, which I ended up going with.When the food came out, at first I was like, what? this is it? It just seemed small to me. But, I was starving and dug in. holy goodness, my eyes lied to me. This food was really really good. Between the cheese, runny eggs and steak, I was loving it! The food was awesome! The hash browns got better once I let them soak in the runny eggs, and threw on a little hot sauce.Overall, the food and service was fantastic. I am so thrilled I got the chance to finally eat here, as its been on my radar for some time.  The only downfalls are really minor. First, parking sucks here, so get ready to walk. Secondly, the place is tiny, so your going to sit really close to people. Aside from that, it's a great place to grab breakfast. I love eating downtown when I can, so it's always a treat for me, and this place rocks. Thank you dime store, you really are worth all the hype!"
4 star rating,Was looking for a new experience. Was looking on yelp for some help. I kept coming back to the reviews on Dime Store. Reading the story of the restaurant and listening to the reviews I couldn't wait to try it out. I dragged my husband for date brunch. We heard the Bloody Mary's and Korean Fries were awesome.When we asked up and asked what to order: Korean Fries. These did not disappoint. Can I say YUM! I wanted to lick the plate clean. We sat at the counter which you think not great. Best place to sit. The staff was amazing and funny. Guess what you get to see all the dishes come out which was super fun!Our Waiter Syd was great. We listened to the recommendations. Order the Korean Fries. It will not disappoint! I'm a Cheesesteak snob. That was amazing. The bread was soft and toasted the onions caramelized  and the meat was tender. Every bite was amazing and you just wanted to say mmmmmmm.....Korean Fries a must and Cheesesteak a must.Staff super friendly and loved it all. Can't wait to come back.
4.5 star rating,"The Dime Store was great! They have a great variety of breakfast/brunch and lunch options. I supposed I would describe this place as a high end, yet casual, brunch spot. The sandwiches looked great, so I would definitely come back for lunch. Breakfast and lunch items cost between $8-12. They have a few beers on tap and a handful of can options. The cocktail menu looked good!I tried, and would recommend, the spicy eggs Benedict. My wife had the smoked salmon breakfast sandwich and she loved it. PLEASE try the Korean Bulgogi Fries... they were soooo good! The pickled veggies on top really balanced it - It wasn't too rich. We also did a half order of the Bacon Truffle Parm Fries. I'm not a huge fan of truffle oil, however, I was pleasantly surprised. They were pretty good as well. Overall, great breakfast experience!Keep in mind, this spot is very close to Campus Martius, which is great! The down side is that parking can be tough.*this rating is compared against other similar restaurants - Brunch/Lunch restaurants"
5 star rating,"We arrived at 9am this morning (Sunday) and were immediately seated. We were told the rush comes a bit later in the morning so if you don't want to wait on the weekend, any time before 10am is a good bet. Our waiter was awesome. He recommended the sausage hash and it sounded so good I ended up ordering it. My husband ordered the French toast with a side of bacon. We both ordered orange juice and were given huge glasses full which is nice compared to tiny juice glasses most restaurants use. My hash was delicious and flavorful. The over easy eggs it was topped with were cooked beautifully and that gooey yolk complemented all the flavors in the dish. My only minor complaint is that my dish wasn't very hot. It wasn't enough to send back, but I would have preferred it hotter. My husband said his French toast was amazing. He felt full before finishing but couldn't stand leaving anything on the plate so he powered through. Bacon was crispy and perfect. Amazing, amazing breakfast. We can't wait to return."
4 star rating,"Tiny little breakfast place inside the Chrysler House. We had a decent wait but got there earlier before the real crowd grew. It's worth the wait though. And convenient you can wait inside the Chrysler House out of the elements which often buffet Detroit. We sat at the bar and had a wonderful time watching the chef and cook staff create their delicious treats! I had the spicy belly eggs Benedict. One of the best I've had with a fun twist on the classic. Their coffee is quality as well. If you see a line, dive in anyway. You won't regret it!"
5 star rating,Very good weekend brunch place in downtown Detroit that is worth the wait if you have the time.Many choices for vegetarians on the menu:*Veggie Hash*Brioche French Toast*Malted Belgian Waffle*Veggie Omelette*Tomato Avocado Breakfast Sandwich*Sweet Poached Pear Salad*Seared Brussel Sprouts Salad*Veggie Burger*Grilled Cheese
4 star rating,"Really solid Detroit breakfast joint. They're waffles are light, fluffy and absolutely killer. Their fries have peel still which is lovely. The staff is very nice as well. I would strongly recommend ordering from the breakfast items, however, as the lunch food is a tad lacking.After all they are known more for breakfast Also if you plan on eating here during the weekend I would suggest coming early as they build up quite a line and you could end up waiting for a solid chunk of time. Overall though I've been really happy with this place since it opened, they add a great vibe to the city and their drinks are a solid addition."
4 star rating,"This is a really popular, always packed breakfast/brunch spot and it's for good reason. The food is great. They have a really good variety of optiona for everyone too which makes it ideal for groups with different dietary restrictions. I recommend coming here but be prepared to wait for a table. I've always waited 30min to an hour for a table."
5 star rating,Very tasty & well made choices...The owners impressed me being onsite like they do...  I have not been back since the COVID changed things...Looking forward to returning.
5 star rating,"I just wrote up a review of a 5 And Dime Canteen, nearly half a country away, in Newington, CT.  This was a 4 out of 5.  The Dime Store in Detroit was easily a 5 and a Big Number One while we roamed Detroit.It was a Friday morning and only 3-4 blocks from our hotel.  The signage to the Dime Store isn't prominent to the first timer, but once in, you'll be a regular.  Hipster interior, groovy and warm staff buzz around efficiently.Our group of 9 were quickly seated and beverages began flowing forward, coffee, tea, water, seltzer, and for this foodie a Virgin Bloody Mary, Dime Store style, sweetly spiced with a garnish pickle wedge and slice of lemon.I can't speak to the numerous plates ordered from our family styled table overlooked my Ike himself, but there wasn't one negative comment shared.  Just Ouu's and Ahhhh's between bites.  I say my THICK MICHIGAN Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Cheese, and spiced sauce on a fresh egg glazed roll was fantabulous.  The fresh side of fruit final healthy ""Pig-Of-Resistance""!"
5 star rating,"I have been here for weekday breakfast many times. I have not tried them on the weekends. The place is fairly small, and it would probably be difficult to get a table. The food is solid and the service is great. I live the french toast. My partner really likes the eggs benedict. The food is fresh, the menu changes, so you won't get bored. The servers are not just skilled, but also very friendly. You feel welcomed and they take great care of you. M We have never had a bad experience. If you need a place to eat downtown this is worth the wait for a table."
4 star rating,"Food is pretty good, but the price point is outrageous. I would advise arriving very early to make sure you can get your name in. There is usually a long long wait time. Worth a try, but an expensive habit!"
4.5 star rating,"Thank goodness I was able to experience Dime Store for my first official breakfast meal here in Detroit!!The Yelp photos looked tasty - but actually visiting made the experience much better!I needed a location that was within walking distance to Cobo Center for a weeklong convention. And a restaurant that seriously has a twist on their menu. I'm serious when I say- you will not be disappointed.Since I already enjoyed the complimentary Starbucks coffee offered in my hotel room- I had to tone down the morning joe a smidge & enjoy the Chai Latte w/ almond milk.For $11 the cheesesteak benny has shaved steak, onions (slivers), shiitake & oyster mushrooms, American cheese, hollandaise sauce and a side salad- which I thought was a bit odd for a side for breakfast- but- honestly, it did the trick! The side salad comes w/ lemon vinaigrette (tangy & tart!)- which I asked our awesome server if she can put it on the side. I was also curious about the maple honey vinaigrette- which I thought paired well with my Cheesesteak Benny."
5 star rating,amazing breakfast spot! food was so yummy and service was greatcoffee could have been stronger but that was fine
5 star rating,It was my first visit here and it just proved it to on of the bests of what I have experienced yet. Excellent breakfast. super crowded spot however we took seats at the counter which was fun. The French toast was very good and the atmosphere was a great way to wake up in the morning.
5 star rating,"What a treat this place is! I was in town for one day/night and wanted to make my food decisions count, goal accomplished at the Dime Store! After a short wait (Saturday brunch timeframe) we were seated and almost immediately had drinks on table; one Bloody Mary and one cold brew coffee made with chocolate milk. The Bloody was very likely one of the best I've had at a restaurant- perfectly strong, great flavor and not too much junk inside taking up space! *****A note for Mimosa drinkers, if you are like me and prefer your Champagne come with a splash of OJ vs your OJ having a splash of bubbles don't go with the Mimosa pitcher. It looked way to orange for my liking. For as busy as it was the food arrived super quick. We had a Croque Madame Benny and a special hash being served that day. My Croque was the winner of the table- it was SO GOOD! On top of it all the service was perfect as was the fun atmosphere! I would 100% go back here on future visits, I was pleasantly surprised how trendy this area of downtown was and loved that the Dime Store existed for a delicious Saturday brunch!"
5 star rating,"We found this place on yelp and were intrigued by the great reviews. It did not disappoint. The menu is innovative and large. I had pork belly eggs Benedict and it was great. Also a Bellini which is always a good idea. The only negative I could say- is it gets very busy, so go early on the weekends. And also I got a to go order of French toast and Parmesan truffle fries. When I got it home they had placed both in the same bag and since they were both warm the fries fell into the waffles and the waffles then had a truffle taste & smushed.  Next time I will ask for the items to be in separate bags."
5 star rating,"We returned recently at the perfect time on a weekday - 10:30am; right between the breakfast and lunch crowds. Didn't have to wait at all with 6 people. I had the most perfect salmon eggs Benedict I've ever had in my life. Every aspect from the English muffin to the hollandaise was top notch. So flavorful, savory and unctuous from the tender smoked salmon to the salty, briny capers. A party in my mouth! Everyone loved their food; a standout was the special - Kung Pao chicken hash. Spicy, flavorful and a large portion. Service was perfect, Zingerman's coffee roasty and mild. The best breakfast experience I've had in awhile."

5 star rating,"On my second visit to Dime Store, I was still very happy, though our food was lacking seasoning this time.  Perhaps a different cook?  My friend ordered the pork belly benny, which really was in need of salt, and I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich.  The caramelized onions and peach jam were yummy, and overall it was a decent sandwich, but I have a feeling the cook threw the chicken breast on the grill while it was still a little bit frozen.  It had that rubbery texture you only get from doing that.  Whoops!  The chicken itself was also very bland.This visit in no way will stop me from returning, but maybe the staff will have to work on consistency a bit."
4 star rating,"Yum.  Yum, yum, yum.  Order the cauliflower gruyere soup.  It's the most velvety, light, delicious creamy soup, ever.  Ever, ever.  I also ordered the duck reuben, which was stupid.  Stupid in the best way.  House-made pickled cabbage slaw, thick-cut fresh bread, spicy mustard, tender, melty goodness.  I sat at the counter, which is fun, because the food-magic happens right before your eyes.  You may smell a bit like a sandwich when you leave, but that's ok. Lol  The server was very friendly, and because I sat alone, I got my food in about 10 minutes. I also got to see all the dishes coming out, and they looked amazing!   I love the layout and the vibe.  The front windows face Griswold, and the decor is earthy and modern.  This would be a great place to take the out-of-towners for brunch.Delectable Detroit!"
5 star rating,"Dime Store definitely live up to the hype; one of our Detroit dining highlights.As a vegetarian it was mainly about the breakfast, but the duck ""bop"" is apparently delicious.Here's hoping they make a strong comeback once this pandemic is finally over!"
4 star rating,"Hands down to their food. The food is so amazing and it never disappoints me. Every time I go there, I always order their orange juice and cappuccino shots. Their steak benny is next level. I love their Dearborn thick cut bacon. The ambience is great for breakfast and brunch. I would have given them a 5 star rating if they had a better wait time solution such call ahead seating or online reservation which includes yelp reservation. The seating is cramped. They could have addressed this as well. Nevertheless, i love taking my friends to this place."
4 star rating,This place is a gem in Downtown Detroit. Short walking distance from the Renaissance Center. Food- Duck Bop: I highly recommend this dish if you're looking for a mix of sweet and savory. It reminded me of a Vietnamese Banh Mi Sandwich. You had the sweetness from syrup & pickled veggies and savory flavor from the duck. We opted for poached eggs for our Duck Bop.- French Toast with Berries: Always a win in my book. I really enjoyed the over texture and taste of the French toast. The syrup was really yummy!These two dishes came out to be less than $25 for two people. Loveee it! Looking forward to trying other dishes when I'm back in town.
5 star rating,"This was my second time coming to this place for brunch and I had to get their Spicy Korean Fries again! It complimented the sangria very well. Although I didn't get brunch this second time around, I ordered their omelette the first time and it was phenomenal. There can typically always be an estimated wait on the weekends but it is definitely worth it. The flavors and quality exceeded my expectations and the ambiance of the place was a cherry on top! I would truly recommend checking this place out as your next brunch spot if you're in the area (or even if you aren't cause I drove from Ann Arbor to check this place out haha)."
4.5 star rating,"So glad I found this place. Another place nearby had a really long wait and actually told me about this one. The food and drinks are great, the service is great and the music is great. Would definitely and gladly eat here again."
5 star rating,"I've been here so many times don't let the wait discourage you TRUST ME. It's worth the wait and the time you will spend sitting, you can check out the menu while you wait. The 4-6 times i've been there always had a wait, the longest I waited was 1hr or about 1hr but it was fine."
5 star rating,"We were in town for a couple of days from Seattle and decided to try Dime Store for brunch. First of all I love the name. I actually grew up in the Detroit area and the local five and dime store was one of my brother and my favorite places to ride our bikes to as kids so definitely felt nostalgic. The  food was great, I got the Korean bulgogi fries and they were amazing. I can tell they fry their French fries in beef tallow which gives them a rich umami flavor."
5 star rating,Hip diner in the heart of the downtown area.  It's places like this that make me argue that downtown Detroit is a better foodie town than Chicago now.  The comeback is real..
5 star rating,"I found this place on Yelp as I desired a good spot for breakfast. I was a little sad to find out the shrimp and grits are a seasonal/rare item on the menu, as I went here specifically for this item. Yet, I did not leave disappointed!I ordered the Spicy Belly Jenny dish with a peach mimosa that hit the spot! Why were both so good, I will never understand! The wait staff was friendly, and the food came out fast. The place is small, so while there was no wait, it can get crowded fast. Parking is metered around this place, FYI. A must stop if you are in the Wayne State area."
5 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a year.  I had something planned yesterday afternoon downtown; so I finally had the opportunity to dine here.  The wait was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  So my friends and I just walked downtown for that time; and came back about 25 minutes before we were able to get seated.Well first off, I loved the ambiance, cute and quaint place.  The music was jamming, and that's always a plus.  Our waiter, his name is Marty, and he was great!  He was very attentive and very friendly.  And all of our orders came out right (5 orders plus).  If I go back to dine in, I would definitely try to request Marty again (well if he is working the day of).So, although the wait was long; the wait for food was not, which was another plus.  I ordered the small fruit cup, and the bacon avocado omelette w/English muffin.  Our table also ordered half orders of the bacon, Parmesan and truffle fries, and the spicy Korean fries.  Both were really good!  Definitely would order those again!  Also, I saw that many people sitting around us ordered Peach Crisp French Toast.  It looked so good!  So one of my friends ordered that, and I tried a bite of hers.  It was very good!  Overall I was satisfied, and whenever I have the time again, I will definitely come back to try something new."
5 star rating,The server Syd was amazing! Very friendly and attentive when i asked questions about the menu! I'm vegan and he helped me build a meal that suited me and it was delicious  my partner had the Belgian waffle and it was also delicious!
5 star rating,"the apple bacon waffles literally have me in a chokehold, my comfort food, never had a bad experience here!!"
5 star rating,Came around 1pm on a Friday with a couple friends. There was no wait. We always come back for the bulgogi fries. They're so so good and a must if you are dining here. We also got a pitcher of sangria which is a better deal than ordering 3 individual glasses.
4 star rating,"I went for lunch on a beautiful Saturday morning and the wait was estimated to be 55-60 minutes. The hostess told us to feel free to walk around while we waited and so the wait wasn't bad at all. It turned out to be about a 30 minute wait but well worth it. I ordered the smoked salmon breakfast sandwich which was only $10.50 and it came with smoked salmon, arugula, capers, onion, a fried egg and cream cheese on toasted brioche bread AND a side salad. The sandwich was so good!!! The interior of the restaurant is pretty hipster and it was packed with lots of people including hipsters and families. Parking is plentiful on the street and the location is awesome. Close to Campus Martius, the riverfront, the Spirit of Detroit and lots of shopping. As one of the top rated brunch spots downtown I was very pleased. The service was fast but a little short and rushed. They were all hustling so I can't knock them too much for being not overly friendly. No one was rude or anything but they were all working hard and didn't spend much time with small talk. Still deserve 5 stars.Worth the wait and totally reasonably priced!"
4.5 star rating,"Yummy  the food was really good. Service was top-notch today and we had an lovely omelettes, duck hash, salad and salmon. What could possibly be better?Recommend this restaurant. Great flavors. Start with the Pork Rines."
5 star rating,"Really great experience. Even better food. Was here on a spontaneous weekend trip with my mom and we stayed in the Westin Book Cadillac. We needed somewhere to go for breakfast before 12. I found the Dime Store on Yelp and thought the pictures looked good so we walked there and had about a 30 minute wait but it was sooo worth it. She ordered the Veggie Hash and oooed and ahhhed over it. I got the brioche French toast with fruit and it was actually the best french toast I've had. They served it with real maple syrup too, none of that Mrs. Butterworts nonsense. The service was great. It was quick and efficient because they were so busy, but they were still friendly. The food was amazinggggg. I totally recommend if you're in the area. It was really good. The place has a really cool vibe too. When I was there they had a parks and rec quote on the walk which I thought was funny. Also, they have you wait for your table in this lobby with really comfortable couches and they give you menus out there so once your seated you can just go ahead and order."
5 star rating,"During our visit to Detroit, it was recommended to eat breakfast at the Dime Store. Initially, as its name says, I thought it was a five-and-dime store but it was actually a popular breakfast spot. It had a nostalgic feel to it which felt like I was visiting Detroit during the early 1900's. I ordered french toast with strawberries. The bread and fruit was fresh and tasted delicious. The orange juice was fresh as well. They serve beer here which is cool because not too many breakfast places outside of Vegas serve alcohol. I would recommend coming here if you're ever visiting Detroit and want a good place to eat and not feel like you got nickel and dimed."
5 star rating,This is our favorite breakfast spot when we come to Detroit.  Fantastic food with wonderful service.  Never a disappointment.

Got to sit at the counter and watch the super talented cooks work their magic. Fun atmosphere. Great service. Delicious food. Get the Korean fries!!"
5 star rating,"The Duck Bop hash is probably the best hash I've had in town. The combination of the all the textures and flavors was incredibly satisfying. I've been to Dime Store several times and I'm pretty confident that I've had other dishes but I honestly don't remember any of the other ones that well. That's not to say they weren't good, but Duck Bop was special.Detroit's brunch scene is quickly ramping up and I appreciate that Dime Store was able to create a dish to set itself apart. I will be back to Dime Store. This single dish is enough for me to give 5 stars."
5 star rating,"Absolutely the best brunch we've ever had! There was about a 45 minute wait as it was busy on a Saturday morning. The menu offered lots of variety and new things to try. Service was fast and friendly! As a group of 5, our bill was right at $100. That was with a couple of cocktails, entrees for everyone, and a couple of add-on plates for the table to share. Overall I would highly recommend this place and I hope to return soon!"
5 star rating,"I'm a foodie and I have tons of experience in eating (LOL). Just moved here from DC and we visited this place about a couple of months ago when looking for a place to stay. The food and service was impeccable so we were excited that we were going to live only a block away'ish from this place. We went back again and man...their food is just.very.yummy. It's super casual yet the food doesn't look or taste casual. It's super fresh and nicely put together. Man, what's up with that spicy Korean fries?!?! What?! Although it wasn't spicy at all to me, it was a nice blend of Korean bulgogi with some thousand island dressing-like sauce on top of yummy fries. It was delicioso!! I love this place! You can't make reservations so sometimes, you will have to wait for a long time. The place is small so I understand. We were there before 9am on Sunday so there wasn't any wait. However! After 9 seems to be when it starts to get much busier. My plan is to taste every single dish from this place. #foodiegoals May be it's not such a great thing that I live so close to the place! Thank God I love to workout too!!"
4.5 star rating,"I was in town (Houston) for the holidays and had heard good things so my family and I decided to try it out. We went on New Years Day (which also happens to be my birthday). We were told about and 1-1.5hr wait for our party of 8. After an hour Mariah (the hostess) told us that seating for the party would be in 10-15min. My cousins (in town from California) looked in the window about 10mins after that to see that the table Mariah was talking about had JUST gotten their food! At this point, we were hungry and tired of waiting. My cousin asked if Mariah could break up our party since it had been over an hour and a half at this point (into 2 sets of 4) and she said that it would be fine. She comes back over after another 5-10min and asks us if we could do 2 different sets of 2 and one group of four. At this point we are tired of waiting and tired of being lied to. My cousins leave and head to Lafayette and the remaining four of us sit down to eat. Mariah's attitude at this point was horrible and did not help any of our already awful experience.If I'm being completely honest, I've had better, I could have gone to any Coney Island in Detroit and gotten the same meal at a cheaper price and without the wait. I won't be back and neither will any of my family or friends still in the area.."
1 star rating,Awesome brunch spot! Always super packed. Got the salmon Benny which was super good. Salmon nicely smoked and the egg perfectly poached.
5 star rating,This place is definitely a must stop for visitors.Food is delicious and service is great. Very friendly and helpful staff.Waffle is the fluffiest waffle I've ever had. The crust isn't crispy but very light and airy with sweet maple syrup. Highly recommend.The veggie burger salad and salmon salad are awesome. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. The brussel sprout with mushroom is highly recommended. Again it's perfectly cooked and seasoned.
5 star rating,"Had the duck bop for brunchThere was a long wait but it was well worth it One of the best brunches I've ever had, which means a lot considering I'm from a city that loves their brunch. Would definitely return and recommend to others"
5 star rating,"Ahhhh dime store....Let's get the negatives out of the way. The hour + wait was severe. No other way to slice that. A party of four on a Saturday morning I do expect a slight wait, but THAT!! No bueno. Need the staff at the front to set realistic expectations from the beginning.On to the food..The steak benny was amazing yet paired with an awkward mixed green salad on the plate. Honestly this should be omitted or substituted with a better pairing.Korean BBQ fries were on point!! Perfection in a bowl. I hate all the bbq sauce sat at the bottom it's killer!!!!!The peach French toast ... my gawd!!! Heavenly.The loss of star is simple due to wait times everything and mean everything else was ooooon point!!!"
4 star rating,After reviewing the numerous brunch options downtown we settled on this gem. Busy but only a 10 min wait. Cool and funky decor. Broad and eclectic menu. Here's a breakdown of our meal:Bloody Mary - Good but not exceptionalBreakfast  old fashioned - Lacking bourbon flavor; very  coffee forward. But again good. Kung pao chicken hash - Amazing!  Next time I have leftover Chinese food am totally stealing this idea!Bacon avocado omelette-  well executed; good but nothing exceptionalKorean fries - Off the chain!  A little on the sweeter side. Would have have liked some more kick. Fries were perfectly crispy. Spicy mayo was a nice accent but again could have been spicier. Service was great and friendly. Will def be back!
4 star rating,"This was a nice little hole in the wall breakfast joint we found, definitely worth getting there early because it get packed fast! Food was amazing and so was the service!"
5 star rating,This spot is cool. Chill atmosphere. Service is friendly and attentive. Food is good. Prices are reasonable. Hit this place for breakfast twice. I urge you to give this a try- you won't be disappointed!!
5 star rating,"It costed little over a Dime in the dime store.. ha ha.. Amazing food, Good vegetarian options (more like eggiterian for breakfast). Weekend street parking is free. Sunday morning Mother's Day breakfast. The place was Super busy. When we went there were at-least 20 ppl waiting. Luckily we were only 3, so we sat almost immediately. . The wait area is comfortable it's the lobby of that building with ample seating. The staff is super friendly and nice. Starting at the front door, the hostess. Who was helping ppl pleasantly even during this busy morning. So the food: The days special - cheese cake and strawberry waffle. - Wow!! Delicious but it's a sin, at least 1 million calories. Lol. It was delicious. I never imagined that combination. But surprisingly superb. We all loved it.  Veggie hash - very good, A bed of crispy cubed potato hash with some sauté veggies, amazing seasoning, topped with two eggs. And a side of biscuit. Perfect dish. Just how I like it. The biscuit was little dry through! Veggie omelet - awesome. Something special about the way they cook the cheese or the type of cheese. Makes the omelette super yummy. Again served with hash and toast. They serve zingerman coffee- I was not a huge fan. But i was ok. They replaced it for a capachino for my wife. They ambience is trendy downtownish. I liked the roman style sketches in the wall and the rustic industrial recycled style furnitures. Basically we loved the place. We will come here often."

5 star rating,"The food here is creative, I love the fact that you can purchase mimosa pitchers here, as many other brunch restaurants do not offer this decision. It is the next typical brunch restaurant in the city. I had the Salmon Benedict and it was very rich. I would probably see myself coming here maybe another time."
4.5 star rating,"I have eaten lunch here several times and love it! I always get breakfast food, it's my FAV!! This time I had an omelette, potatoes, and an English muffin! Delicious!! The jam I believe is homemade and so yummy. Omelette cooked to perfection and full of flavor and ingredients. Our waiter was really good too, I believe his name is Jason. He works at the bar too. My favorite waiter thus far. My coworker had French toast and absolutely loved it. Definitely will be back. Try to go at an off eating time or you will wait; worth the wait though for sure!!"
5 star rating,"This was on my Detroit list of places to try - we got here around 12:30pm on a Sunday during a long weekend, and had about an hour and a half wait. They don't take phone reservations (understandably so given the long stand-by line) but also don't have any form of pager system (everyone basically waits in the lobby of the Chrysler house). It would be helpful in the future if they had some sort of pager system so that guests could explore the area while waiting.Once our number was called we were seated quickly at a small, comfortable table facing the street. Our server Catie took great care of us and got us water and took our order right away. Our food came pretty quickly. I tried the duck bop hash, which was absolutely phenomenal. The breakfast potatoes were diced the perfect size (most brunch places cut them larger) and seasoned and browned to just the right amount. The eggs I requested over medium, and it was perfectly done - a slightly runny yolk but crisp and solid egg white. The duck was flavored really well and very tender. I was a bit wary of the pickled vegetables and sriracha sauce, as I usually avoid both in my dishes, but found that both of them complimented the overall dish really well.They also had a favorite quote of mine chalked onto the wall:""We need to remember what's important in life: friends, waffles, work. Or waffles, friends, work. Doesn't matter, but work is third."" -Leslie Knope"
5 star rating,"A few months ago, I stopped in for a coffee and cookie. It was an oatmeal cookie with cranberries and some other stuff I can't remember, but honestly, it was the best store bought cookie I have ever had! I finally tried a meal at this place after months of saying I would. I got the bacon avocado omelette. A bit pricey at $12 and change for carry out, but the ingredients were quality and worth it. The bacon in the omelette was crispy, plentiful, and flavorful. The cheese was delicious too. And they didn't skimp on the avocado. I got the multigrain ""toast."" I found it odd that it wasn't toasted, I'll request that next time. The house fries were good, nice and crispy."
5 star rating,"One of my favorite brunch spots in Detroit. I try to order something different each time and have never been disappointed. The only downside is the wait. There is usually a 30-45 minute wait during peak times (precovid). However, it is worth the wait!"
5 star rating,"When there are 3 entrees you want to order, but there are only 2 people... First world problems of the brunch world :xTo be honest, I didn't think much of Dime Store when I first heard it, because I thought it was a museum in a potentially sketchy area. Then after seeing the pictures as a hip brunch place on par with the ranks of Portland and SF, I was all in for a trip to Detroit. (Insert comment about gentrification)Dime Store features an enticing menu with creative spins on brunch classics. Some of the dishes have a Korean influence to spice things up (pun intended), like the incorporation of bulgogi or a pan-Asian flair like pork belly. They also have a seasonal specials menu which is the perfect excuse to come back again and again.While I frequently dismiss fries because you can add virtually anything and it will taste (and look) good, I was quite impressed with Dime Store's creations. The Korean fries are all the hype on Yelp, but since we've had our share of bulgogi fries in California (*trying not to sound like a snob*), we started off with the BACON, PARM, & TRUFFLE FRIES ($6/half order) The bacon lardons were chunky cuts of smokey meaty goodness, coupled with a strong overtone of truffle oil and parmesan shavings for the ultimate bouge comfort food.The DUCK BOP HASH WITH PICKLED VEGGIES AND SRIRACHA ($12.5) had nice fusion flavors, featuring a generous portion of duck confit in a quasi-bibimbap, hash style. I recommend sharing; unless you are all about pickled veggies, it can get a bit tiresome after awhile, and the runny eggs render it not very take-out-able. The BLUEBERRY LAVENDER CUSTARD ALMOND-CRUSTED FRENCH TOAST (~$12) from the specials menu was an excellent brunch dessert. The French toast itself is indulgent and satisfying, with a soft eggy interior contrasting with crunchy chopped almonds on the edges. It paired well with the blueberry compote and custard sauce which tasted like condensed milk--unfortunately, the lavender got lost in the sweet mayhem.We had to forego the BENEDICTS, but the Philly cheesesteak Benedict essentially looked like a brunch burger and the pork belly Benedict had such thick cuts that would embarrass any ramen shop. The wait can get crazy on weekends, but thankfully you don't have to get here by 8am and eat a hefty brunch while still half asleep (Things I don't miss about SF). We arrived around 9:30 and there were a few bar seats and tables open. I'd say you're fine if you get here by 10, if you don't have a huge group.Ambiance is what you'd expect for a hip brunch place, nothing too gimicky but a hint of vintage industrial with the tall ceilings and Instagrammable wall decor. (""There has never been a sadness that can't be cured by breakfast food"".... story of my millennial life.)"
5 star rating,"As other reviews have noted, be prepared for a wait during busy dining times. No reservations and no seating until your entire party is present. We got lucky that there was only a short wait. The fortunate part is that they are located in the Chrysler House Building and there is plenty of space as well as seating. I hate the awkwardness of the waiting crowd, this eliminates that situation.The diner is small and a crowded with a fun decor. If you are claustrophobic or planning a secret spy meeting this may not be the place for you. The menu is a good assortment of the familiar and more unique. The service was awesome. I asked the waiter for some type of coffee that was sweet, but not too much so. He said ""I got you"" and he was right. My friend had the veggie omelette and I had the smoked salmon benny. My friends meal was average-good, we agreed mine was better. Others have mentioned the potatoes, they were not over cooked, but just a bit average and boring. I'd give her meal a ""3"". The salmon benny was great. Poached perfectly, everything went well together. Based on the other reviews it seems that the food may inconsistent/depends on what you order."
4 star rating,"Went a while ago. Had the order of Brussels sprouts and they tasted okay but recalled them being soggy, prefer when they are shaved think and roasted until crispy. I had the biggie burger and it wasn't bad, but nothing special. My friend had a burger but he eats anything as long as it's edible and thinks it's food.We also got a side of the parm fries and the taste was a bit lacking on the truffle and the fries appear home cut and on the thick side of things so they were limp and soggy. I prefer the shoe string size and crispy to be good."
3 star rating,"The Dime Store is nestled in the heart of downtown Detroit - a beautiful city that my husband and I visited for his job. Dime Store presents as a no frills, no nonsense craft beer kind of joint. But at second glance, this place takes great pride in their work. We shared the Chicken Hash and Mac and Cheese. The Hash was really good. They use fresh ingredients and it really comes across. The jalapeños gave the hash a solid kick and the cilantro was a nice touch. The Mac and cheese was pretty good too, but the hash was the true star of the show. Will definitely return next time we're in Detroit."
4 star rating,Great restaurant and definitely worth the wait. Try the Korean Fries!!!  Duck Bop was fantastic too. I would definitely go back.
5 star rating,"During a recent weekend visit to the D and not being super familiar with downtown, I luckily stumbled on Dime Store when searching Google maps for a place nearby our hotel to eat breakfast.  Because nothing good comes from eating breakfast at your hotel!Dime Store is located in the historic Dime Building, designed by Chicago's Daniel Burnham...which as someone who grew up in suburban Detroit now living in Chicago I found interesting.  Maybe you will, maybe you won't.Anyhow you didn't come here for a lesson on architecture, so lemme tell you about the FOOD.  It's excellent.  The breakfast menu is fun and creative.  Wide selection but not a huge diner type menu which can be overwhelming.  Let me give one tip:  anything with that Dearborn bacon is worth ordering.  The atmosphere is hopping, and the service top notch.  We sat at the counter by the kitchen which was cool, but man do they cram you in there.  Almost to the point I thought about removing a star.  But then again had they not cramped in a few extra chairs, I might've had to wait longer for said seat.  And the only thing worse than waiting for your breakfast seat is a hotel breakfast..."
4.5 star rating,"The wait for the two of us after 12 on a Saturday was 35 minutes. It was well worth the wait. We sat at the bar. It was fun and a tease to watch all of the food go past us. Our service was great, beer was cold, and the food was to die for. My smoked salmon eggs Benedict was one of the best brunches I have ever had! My Husband enjoyed his BYO omelette with cheese and sausage and said he would get it again. We will definitely be back!"
5 star rating,Amazing grub in an unassuming space. Go for the rotating chefs specials listing - save some space for the amazing Korean spice fries! We will be back!
5 star rating,I was downtown Detroit for a conference and found Dime Store on Yelp with good reviews. It did not disappoint. The atmosphere was great and the staff was incredibly friendly. You could see the cooks and chef making the food if you sat at one side of the bar which was awesome - they loved so quick! I got the roasted brussel sprout salad which was recommended by my waitress. IT WAS AMAZING. I changed the honey dressing for the bacon one. It was the perfect combination of salty and seasoning. It was great that it was a warm salad too because it really enhanced all the flavors together. I would definitely come back for that again. Great restaurant with a ton of options that is a quick walk from the Cobo Convention Center!
5 star rating,"Plus the Korean French fries and spinach and mushroom omelettes were delicious!Served by an awesome server Lauren!  Thanks Dime store, we will see you again soon!Deno"
5 star rating,"Wow. Just great quality food and service.First off, I'd recommend getting there before 10am (the brunch rush). It's located inside of a building lobby so it has limited street view. Second, they have pitchers of group-favorite bevvies. Mimosas, sangria and bloodies! Typically $8~$9 ea or 3x the price for four pours.Third, we were a table of five travelers so we wanted to try all we could. We tried the following, in no particular order, with their highlights: 1. Key Lime Pie French Toast - that lime curd & pie-like crunchy bits!2. Korean Fries - bulgogin goodness! The sriracha mayo is like yum yum sauce (if you know, you kno)3. BLT - thicc bacon + brioche; you can upgrade your fries for a ""half size"" loaded fry opt4. Seared Brussel Salad - thick bacon + charred brussel goodness5. Duck Reuben - I recommend adding an egg (I asked for them over med and they cooked two ind ones and put it on each half!)6. Jerk Chicken Hash - grilled pineapple gods!7. Korean BBQ Sammy - that sauce; just like a banh mi!All in all: quality matches price and services surpassed our Sunday brunch expectation. We had tons of mediocre experiences in the city and this was the best of all eight."
5 star rating,"Great diner place with awesome food, nice attentive staff and fun decor. Came to this place on Saturday of Movement Festival and the place was packed. Managed to get a place at the counter. That can sometimes mean a dead zone of service, but not here. Three different servers helped me throughout my breakfast. Bloody Mary arrived within minutes. Duck Bop a few minutes after that. Timely water refills, check ins etc. Great service!And speaking of the Duck Bop - the best!  Duck confit with pickles + over easy eggs over fried potatoes + a bit of siracha = perfect breakfast!"
5 star rating,"This place is so good, arrive early as they are always crowded and for good reason.  Unique offerings, great staff, very upbeat and more diverse than anywhere I have ever been.  If you are looking for posh upscale the decor might not be to your taste (I love it) but the food and service will."
5 star rating,"Good for breakfast/brunch. The food was what you would expect, so I wasn't overly impressed but it was good. I had the Eggs Benedict, which was on the good side of Benedict's I've had. My friend however, had the French toast and loved it. It gets very busy though, and is located in a pretty busy building so I imagine it's a lunch spot for a lot of people. The tables seemed a bit cramped, considering we were a two seater in the middle, we got bumped pretty often. If you have the option I'd definitely sit along the edges.Overall though, the food was good-great and the waitstaff was very attentive, I'm only docking a star because of the crowdedness."
4 star rating,"Dime Store is such a delicious brunch destination in the D. It's a small space located in the Chrysler building not too far from Campus Martius and Maru Sushi. Dime Store doesn't take reservations and they get very busy on the weekend so be prepared to wait. Also they won't seat your party unless all members are present. We came on a Sunday morning with a party of seven and we waited about 45 minutes. It's definitely worth the wait though and there's is an expansive lobby in the Chrysler building with plenty of comfortable seating and if you get bored, I'd definitely suggest checking out Bon Bon Bon's delicious chocolate boutique in the same building. The brunch at Dime Store is so delicious. They have several omelette options, breakfast sandwiches, brioche French toast, and creative spins on eggs Benedict like Philly cheesesteak, smoked salmon, and spicy pork belly eggs benny. All of the breakfast hashes on the menu sound amazing and that's what most of our party ordered. Half of our group ordered the housemade sausage breakfast hash, with breakfast potatoes, bell peppers, onion, topped with two eggs over easy, spicy ketchup, crema, and slided avocado, yum! You can also have the eggs cooked anyway you like, because one friend ordered them over medium instead. If you're feeling more adventurous, I'd definitely recommend the duck bop hash, which a few of us including myself ordered. The duck bop hash, has breakfast potatoes topped with super tender melt-in-your-mouth confit duck leg, spinach, onion, bulgogi, and is topped with two over easy eggs, pickled veggies and sriracha. The eggs could not have been cooked anymore perfectly! Definite food porn photography op when you cut into the perfectly runny yolks. The duck meat was almost shredded and kind of reminded me of pulled pork. The flavors were phenomenal and I definitely love this unique Korean fusion breakfast dish. I'd definitely order this again!! All of the breakfast hashes are served with an English muffin and jam. They don't ask for your preference of jam flavor, because everyone at our table was surprised with different flavors of jam, although I am sure you could request your preference. Some people had a peach jam and I had the raspberry which was delicious! They also have alcoholic brunch drinks like mimosas and bloody marys and a few others because what's brunch without alcohol but a late sad breakfast, lol. Most breakfast cocktails were around $10 a piece. I had the breakfast old fashioned which was Nitro cold brew coffee, bourbon, orange bitters, and was topped with orange dark chocolate shavings. It was delicious! A friend ordered a coffee with Bailey's and she also really liked it. Service was prompt and attentive. Our water glasses were always filled and we received our checks promptly. Had a great experience here and loved the food. I will definitely be back to get my brunch on again!"
5 star rating,"Dime store is a dime in my books. I was skeptical at first, especially after hearing about the constant wait time. But decided to give it a try since almost literally everyone I know in Detroit had great things to say about this place.I went on a Saturday morning for brunch with just one other friend, which probably minimized the wait time. From the moment we put our names down on the list, the service was impeccable. The greeters were very friendly and our waitress was super attentive and patient. Just such lovely people.This place has a slight hipster feel to it. It's not the biggest diner, and definitely felt cozy. We ordered coffee and the spicy Korean fries to start, which was a pretty decent serving for two girls. The coffee was really good. Our waitress said it was a special blend of Zingerman's coffee that is just for Dime Store. I didn't quite know what that meant but it still made the coffee experience that much more pleasant.I then got the duck bop hash (based off of other people's reviews) and my friend got the cold-smoked salmon bennys. We both loved the hash, which was so so good. I like food with lots of flavor and this certainly did it for me.100% I will be coming back. I loved the atmosphere. Loved the hearty warm meal. And really appreciated the validated garage parking. Even though I'm someone who likes to try different things, I think I will most likely get the same items again. Because they were that good. And I definitely want to come back during a weekday just so it's not so busy and then maybe I can get a window seat next time."
4.5 star rating,"With a 4.5 Yelp rating after more than 500 reviews, I knew the Dime Store was going to be good...it was just a matter of how good!  Walking two blocks from a downtown pay-to-park lot on a mid-winter weekday, a co-worker and I tried this very popular downtown eatery for the first time. Based on the Dime's popularity with the Motor City's lunch crowd, we arrived early at 11:30 am and got our choice of tables. Once seated, our server was quick and efficient in taking our drink order while we surveyed the menu and the interior of this hip and casual space.  I immediately noticed a huge mural of the head of Lady Liberty from the classic Mercury Dime (minted 1916-1945) standing out on the back wall. Right on cue, foot traffic started to increase with mostly young professionals and by high noon, every table in the place was occupied. I ordered the Bacon-Avocado Omelette while my co-worker opted for the Cheesesteak sammy served with deliciously sautéed Shitake and Oyster 'shrooms and onions and a side of outstanding hand-cut fries. Top rated for flavor!My omelette was also great...made with Dearborn bacon, a local fave, along with fresh avocado, tomato and white cheddar. The Dime Store was everything I'd hoped for...brilliant food served by a team enthusiastic about their restaurant. 5 big ones."
5 star rating,"Our time here was very pleasurable for breakfast/lunch. Although there was a short wait, we were able to score a nice 2 top table by the window so we could see outside and get some natural light. We ordered a Michigan Cherry draft, a Fat Tire draft, a breakfast burrito, and spicy Korean fries. Everything was great, and the price was pretty average. Our server, Lauren B, was very friendly and took great care of us. Would return in a heartbeat if I find myself in Detroit again!"
5 star rating,Great experience here!  Christopher and Nicole helped us get seated and accommodated our group of 7.  Kenyada was our waiter and was very polite and took care of us very well.  All encounters with staff were so welcoming with smiles and very very nice. Food was delicious and will definitely be returning!
5 star rating,"Dime store is located in Downtown Detroit. Came in for breakfast on a weekday and luckily we were able to get a table for two fairly quickly. FOOD: Cheesesteak Benny ($11.00)As soon as I saw cheesesteak on the menu, I knew I had to try it as it is a unique twist on the eggs benny. I was not disappointed as it was full of flavour. I'm a huge fan of sausage gravy so we also ordered biscuits and gravy ($11.00). The gravy was a bit bland but overall enjoyable. Overall, Dime Store is a nice and modern brunch joint."
4 star rating,"Wasn't expecting this to be tucked away in a building, but this place exceeded my expectations! Our waitress was incredibly welcoming and the service was speedy. The coffee came quick and there was no charge for refills. The daily special was a lemon curd waffle and it blew me away. Crunchy waffle smothered in lemon curd topped with strawberries and crunch. All the other food ordered at the table looked gorgeous as well.Price was reasonable and I suggest going through the week because it will be more quiet and easy to get a table.Highly recommend this place!"
5 star rating,"Very busy little shop with what seems to be a decent brunch menu. Seating doesn't accommodate large groups very well, as there is only one table that can seat a party of up to 10.The smoked salmon benny was alright. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the sauce was well seasoned; however, it could have been thicker. The home made biscuit was very tough to cut through and did not have any actual taste on its own. I also took the opportunity to try some my friends' dishes, which were similarly a mixed bag. One dish was a duck and potato hash tossed in some kind of sweet/savory sauces. Unfortunately, I found the sauce overwhelming and waaaaay too sweet. Another dish was what was advertised as a Korean bbq sandwich with consisted of a French style bread, barbecued meats, pickled vegetables and cilantro.... almost like a Vietnamese banh mi, rather than some Korean sandwich Overall, I found the entire experience underwhelming. My favorite thing would have to be the mimosa pitchers for the price of 3 glasses (get the peach mimosa)."
3 star rating,This was so good! We got the duck hash and the salmon Benny. We were tempted to lick our plates clean! The service was attentive and so nice. We would definitely come back.
5 star rating,"MUST COME HERE!!!! This is the best brunch spot in Detroit! Food is always amazing and service as always excellent. I usually get the duck confit but tried something new with the Cheesesteak Benny, which was delicious- highly recommend."
5 star rating,"Absolutely out of sight!A thoroughly enjoyableable experience from start to finish, even the waiting area was pleasant.When you arrive there it is a station where they take names and assign a number. I was so pleased that there were all these comfortable couches and chairs to sit in while you were waiting for your number.We were seated at the counter overlooking the kitchen, which was a lot of fun as we watched the kitchen staff hustle and make all of these amazing dishes.My daughter had a smoked salmon sandwich, which was prepared locks and onion style.  She indicated the cream cheese was a little overpowering, but I'm sure I would've loved it.I had the special, I have wonderfully prepared barbecue pulled pork hash with eggs on top. The accompanying biscuit was flaky and perfect, and the strawberry jam tasted homemade.Coffee from Zingerman's completed the experience and was absolutely delicious.Reasonably priced, terrific service, and wonderful food. You can bet we'll be back!"
5 star rating,"Unbelievable food, this place is tiny like 8 tables so unless you're there right at opening expect to wait. The service and our server were awesome! Definitely will be coming back! We had an omelette with potatoes that were cooked and seasoned perfect and their waffles."
4.5 star rating,"Ordered carry out today, quoted a very quick 15-20 mins. When I went in to pick it up, you could tell that they were very busy. 1-1/2 wait for dine in I overheard. With that being said, the carry out was awesome! You could tell that they put care into each order even when they are busy, which is rare for restaurants. The food was great and filling for an extremely reasonable price!"
5 star rating,"Today was my second visit to Dime Store and it was just as good as the first time. I ordered the strawberry French toast (Chef Special) & truffle fries and enjoyed every bite! Our waiter was Justin & he was great! Cons: The restaurant is fairly small and doesn't take reservations, so early arrival is suggested.However-This restaurant is a must visit place to eat in Detroit!"
4 star rating,"3.5 stars, but since this restaurant has such high ratings, I rounded down. I really wanted to like my dish. The duck bop ($12.50) sounded amazing. ""house-confit duck leg, spinach, onion, bulgogi, pickled veggies, siracha."" Nowhere on the menu did it state drenched in super sweet soy sauce. Maybe that's what ""bulgogi"" was supposed to mean, the combo of meat (beef) and sauce? I don't know. It was so sweet that I had to move my food to another plate and there was still a pool of sweet sauce at the bottom of my plate. On top of that, my plate was pretty greasy on the sides. My friends really liked their dishes.- The cold smoked salmon been looked delish- The Korean fries ($6 half order) had a good meat to fry ratio, but my friend did have to ask for more spicy mayo sauce.- The mac & cheese ($4 side) was a little too liquidy for my taste and was also grainy. I would skip this.- The latte is made ($3.75) with Zingerman's beans, so that was pretty tasty, but comes in the same cup as the regular coffee. - Coffee ($2.75) = free refillsService was average. The waitress did her job, but nothing out of the ordinary."
3 star rating,"Great brunch and breakfast place in an iconic building! We came here with a couple friends who we're visiting in town. Dime Store has been on my radar for the longest time, and many friends were in disbelief that we hadn't tried this place out sooner. But alas, timing wasn't on our side each time we attempted to dine here.We arrived on a Sunday late morning, and queued up to an hour wait. By the time we got seated, the wait was close to 2 hrs. Whatever you do, don't come here on an empty stomach if you plan to arrive around the same time! Bon Bon Bon has a shop in the same building to satiate your hunger pains temporarily. :)Husband and I got their cheesesteak Benedict, Korean Fries, and Brussels sprouts salad. All were simply satisfying, with the Cheesesteak Benedict being the star. Pristinely poached eggs, a creamy and light Hollandaise sauce amplified the earthy and hearty protein. One portion was enough for the two of us to split, but if you're feeling ravenous, one person can definitely gobble it all up. :)Fries were nice and hot, but I would have asked them to be more well done so it held the sauce longer without it turning slightly mushy. Brussels sprouts salad is for the pork lover, and a very generous portion. We were pleasantly surprised! Leftovers reheat wonderfully, or you can eat it at room temperature.Another thing to note is the local artisanal coffee they serve: freshly brewed and good value. I had a sip of Husband's, and thought it was wonderful.Overall, great breakfast and brunch place for Detroit, but be prepared to wait. Thankfully, it's located in the Chrysler House with lots seating in the lobby, and lots of parking options nearby.I'd be happy to return when I'm in the area next!"
4 star rating,"Stevie: So, just to be clear... I'm a red wine drinker.David: That's fine.Stevie: Okay, cool. I only drink red wine. And up until last night, I was under the impression that you, too, only drank red wine. But I guess I was wrong?David: I see where you're going with this. Um, I do drink red wine. But I also drink white wine. And I've been known to sample the occasional Rosé. And a couple summers back I tried a Merlot that used to be a chardonnay, which got a bit complicated.Stevie: Oh, so you're just really open to all wines.David: I like the wine and not the label. Does that make sense?Stevie: Yes, it does.So, David not only accurately describes my sexuality, but my taste in food as well. Dime Store seems to have done right by both of these. Not only is the staff fantastic...(yes, I'm talking about the gorgeous, tall host on a Saturday morning) They also have an amazingly eclectic menu. (yes, I'm talking about you pork belly benny)Please, go here. Anyone that contributes amazingly well to the new/old Detroit is great in my book. (yes, i'm talking about the host again)"
5 star rating,Cute breakfast diner in convenient downtown location.  Very charming.  I came by on a Wednesday morning so no line and quick service.  I had the signature dish- duck leg confit with egg.  It was really good!  The only thing was the potatoes were room temperature but the rest of the dish was hot.  The dish also had a bit more salt than it should.  Despite this it was still very good.  Friendly service.I am sure I would give this a 4 if I had a chance to cime
3 star rating,"40 min wait for lunch on Friday. Wish this place took reservations. The Brussels sprouts salad and kimchi fries are super great. I'd just get those next time. You should too!Corned beef hash was a real disappointment, even though waiter recommended it. Just tiny shavings of corned beef, too much potato, uninteresting. Wish I'd gone with the dick bop. Friend also found himself very unimpressed with his BTLE sandwich. Neither of us finished our food.Service was superb, but given that most of our food was underwhelming, I'm not sure I would go again."
3 star rating,"Ok so I know this place is supposed to be all the rage but we just thought it was ok. I was here a few weeks ago with a friend. We waited a bit over an hour for brunch and the lobby was packed. So they give you a number when you arrive and are flexible on you leaving the building as long as you tell them. Ok so we decide to go kill time for a bit and let them know. When we return they gave us a different number. Well this system doesn't work as they called the first number and not the second. If my friend had not remembered our original number we would have missed our reservation. Just let people keep the same number, since the staff does not communicate well and it's just not a good idea to begin with. So we finally get seated at a table that really shouldn't be there. It is a space between all the bench areas. It was not comfortable being backed right up to the people behind me and struggling to get in and out. I am sure the servers would also appreciate a little space to move. A couple was seated next to us after we ordered. Somehow they got their food and were almost done before we got our food, and then they blamed it on my friend ordering her burger well done. huh?? They don't take that long to cook. Not sure what really happened but the food came as soon as we asked for an update. So overall just ok. Our waitress was very nice. Atmosphere is cramped and loud. Coffee was fine, OJ is from a carton and not fresh, fyi. The burger, fries, and cheesesteak benedict were good. It is nice that salad is a side option without extra charge. The home fries are not good, very small squares of potato that were overcooked, not sure who thought that was a good idea. Even if the food were amazing, the atmosphere is uncomfortable and the wait too long for an average experience. We didn't get the hype and my friend said she liked The Hudson Café better. There are too many brunch places in Detroit to return."
3 star rating,"This is a delayed review: dined in 10.15. Three Words... Oh-My Goodness...When we arrived I didn't know what to expect. The wait was minimal for a two top (about 20-30minutes for a Saturday Morning). I was very curious about the menu at this Brunch Bar! The atmosphere was very thick, with medium chatter.  After our wait.....To my amazement there were these cute desk - table tops....Very Cute touch! I looked around in amazement how busy they were.  Yet, how everyone seem to be enjoying the food, beverages and just the restaurant itself.I ordered their Omelette with Turkey Sausage (you can get it with Pork Sausage too)....with an English Muffin; The Fontina Cheese was a nice touch...The Omelette had Much flavor to be enjoyed!!!...He had this 'Scrumptious - Dumptious' Waffle with Apple Drizzle, along with Whipped Cream and Donuts.  Yes that's right, two tiny bite sized Donuts. {Wish I could recall the name of it} Oh and the Diced Apples in that delicacy of a drizzle was very good. To my Delight ---- the English Muffin was skipped, I enjoyed his Waffle so much. Wish I can give this experience SIX Stars....Hey I love to eat --- till next time."
5 star rating,Food was amazing Tons of friendly staff Great atmosphere Wonderful location Great experience
4.5 star rating,"Be prepared to wait for a table, but the food is so worth the wait! We went in around 12:30pm on Saturday, and only waited for around 30minutes (the waitress gave us a very accurate estimated wait time!) before we were seated. Service is also great!Dime store is a small hipster brunch spot located inside a building. If you park in the Financial District Garage (which is literally around the corner from the building that the restaurant's in) you can ask for validated parking once you're done with your meal to get up to 2 hours of free parking! I ordered the smoked salmon benny (AMAZING!) with the side salad. You can never go wrong with a salmon benny, and not to mention the aesthetics were on point! My friends ordered the duck bop hash and one of the omelettes. They both enjoyed what they ordered too, and presentation looked amazing too! I have to say this place has a nice twist to some of the food you can order on the menu, and it's a place I would definitely come back and dine at! Prices were reasonable and the portions were perfect! Overall, had a wonderful time here with delicious food, good service, and a great atmosphere!"
5 star rating,Special. Spicy pollo loco hash. Coffee.Zingerman's coffee. Great special. Cool atmosphere. Great service. Great addition to downtown Detroit!
5 star rating,"During our visit to Detroit, it was recommended to eat breakfast at the Dime Store. Initially, as its name says, I thought it was a five-and-dime store but it was actually a popular breakfast spot. It had a nostalgic feel to it which felt like I was visiting Detroit during the early 1900's. I ordered french toast with strawberries. The bread and fruit was fresh and tasted delicious. The orange juice was fresh as well. They serve beer here which is cool because not too many breakfast places outside of Vegas serve alcohol. I would recommend coming here if you're ever visiting Detroit and want a good place to eat and not feel like you got nickel and dimed."
5 star rating,I had such a fantastic brunch here with an old friend visiting from out of town! I'm vegetarian & she is GF and we had lots to chose from. The mimosas were so good i had 2! Our waitress was really sweet & accommodating. They are taking great precautions against covid & the tables all had hand sanitizer for our convenience & the door had a station as well. The greeter was energetic & friendly as was all staff members we had interactions with!
5 star rating,"This is now on my list for my favorite brunch places. I came on a Saturday afternoon and the wait was about 30 min and so worth it. We got to get some coffee, sit in the lobby, and look over the menu before getting called. Luckily I was able to order the banana foster, and try bites of the Korean duck fries and the duck bop hash. There was not a single but I didn't think was great. The duck bop is their most popular plate it seemed like by how many people around us ordered it. The French toast was also a great sweet start of the day and the duck bop was the perfect combination of flavorful and sweet. I can't wait to go back and try more"
5 star rating,"The Duck Bop hash is probably the best hash I've had in town. The combination of the all the textures and flavors was incredibly satisfying. I've been to Dime Store several times and I'm pretty confident that I've had other dishes but I honestly don't remember any of the other ones that well. That's not to say they weren't good, but Duck Bop was special.Detroit's brunch scene is quickly ramping up and I appreciate that Dime Store was able to create a dish to set itself apart. I will be back to Dime Store. This single dish is enough for me to give 5 stars."
5 star rating,"Let me tell you something.....downtown Detroit is way cooler than I had ever imagined!  There were lots of cool looking lunch spots and I chose this one.Sat at the counter.  They primarily serve breakfast foods, but I was craving a salad.  So I had the one with Brussels sprouts and gigantic chunks of bacon.  Also tried the grilled cheese.  I washed that down with the cucumber/ginger drink they had on draft.  Refreshing! Love the ambiance, and the food.  Took a little while for my food to come out, but it was super busy there on a Tuesday afternoon."
4 star rating,Best brunch experience. Staff are so fun and helpful. Food was great and could be modified how I like. New social distancing setup was great. Fun place to brunch with friends :)
5 star rating,"Highly Recommend by a friend who had been here many years ago. cozy business inside another  building, look for signs. The staff is helpful, kind but rushed trying to get the patrons to seats and others out the door.  Busy place.The food was good and presented nicely.Nice place to try,"
4 star rating,"Diane and I went there for New Year's Day, and it was awesome they open at 10:00 AM so try to get there by 9:45 AM and you may have a short line like we did but It'll be OK"
4.5 star rating,"I have to agree with another reviewer. This place is finally one of those places that live up to the reviews and isn't just another pretentious hipster spot with overpriced average tasting food. I ordered the cheesesteak egg Benedict and wow! I don't know if I've ever tasted something so amazing in my life for brunch! It really hit the spot for me. I don't like mushrooms at all and I just ate them with this and didn't mind it or notice! It came with a side salad with some type of lemony tasting vinaigrette was pretty good too.   My boyfriend got the veggie hash. This one actually wasn't so great. It was not bad, it just wasn't amazing. It was kinda dried out. My dad got the special Kokomo French toast. Didn't try any except the maraschino whipped cream but it looked beautiful and yummy. My sister got the mac and cheese and was very satisfied. I tried some and it was good! Had a smokey almost bacon like flavor too it. Finally, her boyfriend got a cheeseburger and he was happy. My only complaint is they gave us the tiniest bit of ketchup. My boyfriend went up to the cooking area and asked for more ketchup and they gave him a big bottle. The waiter saw he had it and asked him how he got that. He then took it away and brought back another tiny container of ketchup and made an awkward situation for two people to share a tiny bit of ketchup -_-I will definitely be back!"
5 star rating,Popped into Dime Store for a quick breakfast after an early flight into Detroit and it was the best decision! Our waitress told us that we couldn't go wrong ordering anything on the menu and she was right! We sat at the counter and everything coming out of the bustling kitchen looked amazing. We had the vegetable hash and French toast with fruit - both were delicious! The French toast was hands down some of the best I've ever had. Top breakfast off with a peach mimosa (much bigger than expected) and we definitely left satisfied. I'll be back to the Dime Store next time I'm in Detroit.
5 star rating,"Hit this place for brunch on a Saturday for my birthday.  Had almost an hour wait, and my whole party of 6 couldn't even sit together.Food was good, but good enough for that wait, still unsure."
4 star rating,"Great place in the heart of downtown Detroit! I've been here a few times now and it has not disappointed. Although the dining area is tight and there is usually a wait, the food is worth it! I have had both the homemade sausage hash and the biscuits and gravy. Both were delicioussssss! I would like to go back for lunch or dinner sometime. The only suggestion I have is they text you when your table is ready. Wait times are usually lengthy and although there is an entire lobby area to wait, it would be nice to be able to walk around downtown Detroit to kill some time while waiting for your table."
4 star rating,"Awesome brunch spot in downtown Detroit! I visited with a friend around 1 on a Friday and it was packed! We waited around 15 minutes for a table and then were seated in the back of the restaurant. All of the food coming out of the kitchen looked amaaaazing so I couldn't help asking the waitress what everyone else was eating (don't judge). This wound up being my best idea of the day because tons of people were eating the daily special (BBQ chicken hash) and I knew I had to try it. My friend and I decided to share the BBQ chicken hash and an order of fries because the hash looked huge and who doesn't need fries with aioli at all times? Our only mistake was ordering a large fry because we couldn't let them go to waste... oh well we know for next time!When our food came out we were so excited! The hash was huge and had so many delicious layers of egg, chicken, corn, potatoes, etc etc etc etc and even came with a warm flaky biscuit. Our waitress also offered us our choice of hot sauces, which paired perfectly with our hash and tastes delicious mixed in with our truffle aioli for the fries (wow I'm making myself hungry). The food was very flavorful and the portions were huge for the price (the special hash was only $12.95). I will definitely return the next time I'm in Detroit! Food - 5 starsPrice - 4.5 starsService - 4.5 starsAtmosphere - 4 stars"
5 star rating,This place is one of my favorites. It's a definite go to for good food and a good time! I've lost count of how many times I've been. But I don't even look at the menu anymore because I get the same thing every time! I made a lunch sandwich more like brunch. I get the salmon sandwich and add an egg with a side of brussel sprouts and peach mimosas to make it all pop!!!!
5 star rating,"YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS oh my god. The waffles... lord have mercy. I had them over 2 years ago and I couldn't stop thinking about them. Finally I caved and went back and they were just as I remembered them. light , fluffy, sweet , and delicate. god tier. I don't even like waffles, but these are straight fire."
5 star rating,"Have been here for three times and now we finally decided this place is well overrated. I brought my friends who were visiting out of town here on a Sunday late morning. I told the host we had 6 people total and she initially said we had to all present and all wait there. The wait was about an hour to 1.5 hour long, which was fine. We actually left the building and walked around downtown. We came back within 50 minutes. I checked with the host and she actually had me down for 3 people. Then of course there was another table of six that they seated right before us who actually came after us. I really think they should have different system about seating people. Drink: we ordered a pitcher of Bloody Mary, a pitcher of peach mimosa, a cup of coffee. They were all OK. Mimosa was mostly orange juice. Food: we ordered 2 full order of bacon Parmesan truffle fries and a full order of kimchi fries. The first ones were awesome. We all agree that's the best item among all dishes we ordered. Kimchi fries was a fail. I ordered korean beef sandwich, oh gosh, which was wayyy too salty! This is my third time attempting to order something different here, it's also the third time being disappointed. I really don't think they know how to do the korean flavor, always way too salty. Thought I could impress my friends with this restaurant in downtown, and it turned out to be a disappointment, every single time."
3 star rating,So delicious! Menu is always so exciting and seasonal. Soups are SOOOO good! It's a small place and typically always busy so wouldn't be surprised if you have to wait. Usually go for brunch because it's my favorite meal there.
5 star rating,"Overall: Sweet, savory, coffee-y, dime store can cover all your needs. Tasted great!The good: Great tasting food, the pork belly benny was fantastic. Tried the duck hash too, and I wish I could've had that instead. Regardless, great food. Fruit cup was a great size, and the portions overall are good. The menu is huge and well-varied. The not-so-good: Place is pretty cramped and tight spaces, making moving around awkward and cramped. The service was lacking at times, had to ask bus boy for water and coffee two times.Atmosphere: 8/10Service: 8/10Food: 8/10"
4.5 star rating,"This was stupid good. As others said, the place is tiny (so you're seated close together) and there is often a wait, but we were so pleasantly surprised by this place! We were staying at a downtown hotel, so we walked here (very convenient). I ordered the Cheesesteak Benny and my husband had the General Tso's Benny - YUM! We also split a half order of the fries, which were divine. I'd totally come back here again if I'm in downtown Detroit around brunch!"
5 star rating,Fast. Delicious food. I would definitely return. The hot chocolate was good. Didn't care for the Lottie
5 star rating,"I've been here so many times don't let the wait discourage you TRUST ME. It's worth the wait and the time you will spend sitting, you can check out the menu while you wait. The 4-6 times i've been there always had a wait, the longest I waited was 1hr or about 1hr but it was fine."
5 star rating,Love love love the food and spicy bloody mary's.  I go there for brunch but get there early AF so I don't wait that long for a table.  I would wait if I have to because the food is that good.  Duck confit is my fave
5 star rating,"This is the absolute spot to grab breakfast in Detroit. Make sure you get the house made jam, it's an absolute MUST!"
5 star rating,A poor attempt at trying to be a trendy downtown breakfast shop. The potatoes were the pre shredded frozen variety. The eggs were over cooked. The spicy ketchup tasted like Heinz with some kind of poorly blended spicy added and this concoction was drizzled all over the dish. I won't be back. At least they have good coffee.
1 star rating,I LOVE THIS SPOT! Jus wish it wasn't so busy or the wait wasn't so long or else I would give it 5 stars. They have the best French toast ever!!
4 star rating,My husband and I were downtown yesterday and had breakfast at the Detroit Dime Store .  It was excellent!!!  I had the b.l.t.e. and my husband had the Spicy Belly Benny!  Will definitely go back again!!!
5 star rating,"Solo trip to Detroit, I wandered out of the hotel in search of a hearty diner-type late breakfast/early lunch. A helpful guy staffing an ice-cream window recommended this spot.  He said it was worth the few block walk and he was right!  Arrived about 11:20 am and the place was almost packed.  I sat at the counter overlooking the tiny open kitchen.  The cooks were focused and working in calm unison. Katie my waitress returned with my coffee very fast.  The homemade sausage hash sounded like the perfect choice ~ and it was!  The homemade sausage was spicy but not too heavy on the sage or fennel.  What really stood out were the potatoes. Seasoned cubes of grill-fried Heaven. The dish was chock full of sauteed diced peppers and sausage, topped with 2 expertly prepared over easy eggs and some avocado slices.  Probably could have drank the raspberry sauce served with the English muffin!! It's a pretty small venue.  Antique wooden school seats give a trendy hip feel. The servers are real pro's, I watched how they inspect and garnish each plate before serving.  It seems like everyone really took pride in their respective roles, no wonder this place is so highly recommended!"
5 star rating,"Did not even get a chance to go in, on Sunday wait was 45 minutes but after an hour we decided to leave but the host was super friendly"
4.5 star rating,"Two Big Giant reasons why it took me this long to finally walk though those doors and eat here is because.1.) The people I constantly hear raving about this joint are the chicken fingers and potato sticks crowd.2.) The shop sounds like a Chicken Fingers and Potato Sticks joint.But now I am a believer. I truly am very impressed with what they are doing here.Today was a Friday during the lenten season, so no meat in this mouth. We ordered the house fries with the truffle mayo and the seared brussel sprouts salad. The fries were really nice, perfect texture and crunch, paired with the truffle mayo is out of this world! The salad had so much depth and substance, it was just sublime! Plus that raspberry dressing was really nice. We did pick out the pork belly pieces though. But would probably be awesome if we weren't practicing lent. Oh well, maybe next time.The service was really good as well. The host was very welcoming, sat us right away. Our server was very nice and very friendly. Our beers were cold and our waters were cold as well.I enjoyed my dining experience here. I would definitely love to return and break bread here again. Thank you for reading my review."
5 star rating,"Waited about 30 minutes even for just one seat at the bar counter. Well worth the wait! The Duck Reuben was delicious, and the half order of Spicy Korean Fries complements it perfectly. A bit too much food, but hard not to finish it. Service was friendly, and it's evident that the staff is top-notch."
4 star rating,"Decided to take my friend here to celebrate her birthday-thanks to the Yep reviews, one of my other friends got there early to get us on the list.We only waited about 30 minutes and had plenty of time to review the menu.  The restaurant is small with close quarters but I didn't feel squashed.  It's a bit noisy with all of the people and kitchen stuff going on, but we could still carry on our conversation.We started with the pork rinds, which I had never had.  They blew my mind, crispy and light with a kick from the sriracha.  Between all of us, we tried the Belgian Waffle, the Chicken Pesto Sandwich, and the Spicy Belly Benny.  We tried each others food and were in general food coma heaven afterwards because everything was excellent.  Our server was attentive and friendly and we had a great time enjoying each other's company. I would highly recommend the Dime Store and I can't wait to go back and visit."
5 star rating,"It took about 30 minutes to get a seat for 2 of us, but now I know why.  Service was great.  Loud and energetic space.  Food was great we ordered Banana Foster French Toast and the Spicy Belly Benny.  Both were amazing.  Definitely will be back.  Great way to start the day."
5 star rating,I LOVE THIS SPOT! Jus wish it wasn't so busy or the wait wasn't so long or else I would give it 5 stars. They have the best French toast ever!!
4 star rating,"In town for business, this breakfast restaurant was walking distance from my hotel and had dine-in seating. I arrived early and only two other tables were occupied. I ordered a cappuccino and eggs benedict, with a side order of potatoes. The reason I give 3 stars is that nothing was hot. Not even close.  Due to Covid, I didn't want anyone touching my food more than necessary, so I ate without complaining. When the server brought me my check, he asked how everything was, so I told him that nothing was hot. His response was ""I'll tell them"". Not sure he followed through, so I'm telling ""them"" by writing this review. The quality of my meal was fine, but would have been a lot better had it been hot. There's no excuse for that."
3 star rating,"Been here a few times and I always get an amazing experience. I've seen this place get pretty busy but I've been seated fairly quick. The place is quite small, so you're seated pretty close to people. Hey, you might even pick up on some juicy convos. (kidding!)Ok to the food. Started off with spicy korean fries. It was really good, the shaved steak was cooked perfectly. For the main dish I got the cold-smoked salmon Benny. It was delicious! If you don't fancy salmon as much, I wouldn't recommend though. The English muffin was the perfect texture. You can also get the fruit bowl as a substitution side. My girlfriend got the duck bop, that was very tasty and flavorful. Service was great as always. Didn't get her name but she was a great help.I have yet to try their to-go stuff, next time!"
5 star rating,This place was excellent. Prices are reasonable for the amount you get. Had friends visitng from out of town and loved the brunch here. I'm not sure what they got because i'm vegetarianParking: OK - came on a Saturday morning and was able to find paid street parkingService: Very good and attentive waiterFood: Veggie Hash - Recommend for Vegetarians. I got the eggs well-done.
4 star rating,"Cool place! Busy, friendly staff and good food. Had a veggie omelette.  4/5 because I thought the coffee could be better and the food was good but somewhat average. Overall would come back again and I do recommend, has a very cool vibe!"
4 star rating,"You won't regret eating here!!Holy smokes what a fantastic meal. Nitro cold brew on tap, everything made from scratch. It was delicious! We haven't eaten downtown in awhile and were questioning if we were in Detroit or LA. The dining room isn't huge so if you're going at a busy time, I'd anticipate a wait."
4.5 star rating,"I don't give 5 stars often, but this place was just top notch.There was a long wait but totally worth it. I had the salmon Benny's while my boyfriend had the special hash of the day. Both amazing.We also had the pork rinds which were unreal.I hope to go again."
5 star rating,"First time eating here.Cool, brightly lit (brunch time) spot.It was 100% packed with everyone seemingly enjoying their food.I had a Spicy Bloody to drink and a special Cannoli Waffle. This was absolutely amazing! KudosOur server Scott was super nice and easy but also fast. I would definitely recommend this place, the food is awesome for Brunch style items. I want to go back for more!"
5 star rating,"OMGeeezy! The food was delish. The wait was over an hour, but I'm glad we stayed. I had the grilled cheese sandwich, and the mac 'n cheese with bacon and brussels added. Incredible! The others I dined with had the bananas foster French toast (perfect with just the right amount of sweetness, not overly sweet) and the garlic parm truffle fries with bacon  (tossed with the right balance of truffle oil, garlic, and Parmesan cheese). I cannot wait to dine here again. I did notice that the crowd significantly thinned out at around 12:30. 10 AM on a Sunday seemed to be a peak time. I will definitely avoid this time slot on my next visit."
4 star rating,The food was amazing! The wait staff was fast and very nice. Best breakfast in the downtown area and the Bloody Mary and mimosas are a great way to start your morning after a long night.
5 star rating,We went for breakfast yesterday food was delicious and the rest of the menu looks great.our server was a little slow with the coffee and cream with no rush. I would still go back and try the other items on the menu!
3 star rating,"The half hour wait to have brunch here was absolutely worth it. What the Dime Store lacks in square footage, it makes up in taste. The selections of food, drink and trendy ambience make this a go-to place, whether you go by yourself or in a party of 6."
5 star rating,"I was looking for a place to get brunch in Detroit and they did not disappoint! For the record, you should get here early - I arrived at 9 and got a quick seat, but by the time I left an hour later, the line was out the door! I can understand it, though - this place isn't very large. I got the spicy bloody mary - fairly standard, but still well done, as well as nitro brew coffee (delicious) - but the real standout was the duck bop hash - duck leg with bulgogi and pickled veggies. The only criticism i have is that it could have been a bit less sweet and a bit more spicy. Great staff, great food, great vibe."
5 star rating,Visited this place for breakfast on a Friday morning round 9 which happened to be the perfect time as our party of 2 got seated almost immediately and once we'd finished there was a sizable line out the door waiting lol.   The atmosphere was very chill but the waitstaff was attentive. The decor is just the right touch of hipster without going overboard. I ordered the Duck bop and it was delicious! Every component was flavorful but one minor ding is I think it had a little bit too much sauce which collected and soaked into the potatoes and kind of overwhelmed me after awhile. But other than that it was great! Will definitely come back and try more items! Everything on the menu sounded good haha.
5 star rating,"My first time eating here was today. The wait was 45 mins to an hour but I'm so happy I waited. The food is super yummy, the service is really nice, and the location is in the heart of downtown. I'm so happy to add this place to my brunch list! I ordered their French toast and veggie hash!"
5 star rating,"Great atmosphere, delicious food, fare prices but be prepared to wait for a table!First time stopping in for brunch over the weekend and I knew there might be a wait, but wasn't prepared for a 45-60 min. wait. It was a Sunday though, and a home Lions game, so I guess it's to be expected.Once seated, we were given water a few minutes to look over the menu. A friend of mine who had been there before (and was also a vegetarian/vegan) suggested a few items on the menu for me and I ended up getting the veggie hash. It was so, so good. Potatoes, peppers, shiitake and oyster mushrooms, crispy onions, crema and two over easy eggs on top. It also came with an English muffin and jam on the side. SO. MUCH. FOOD. and for $10.50! I left full and satiated for sure. The space is really small so the tables are packed in, but it wasn't too bad. It was also very hot in there and it was starting to get warm outside so that made for a little warmer visit than anticipated, but it wasn't too bad. Parking can be tricky but there are plenty of garages nearby (I parked in the Financial District garage on the Lafayette/Griswold entrance); my friends parked on the street and then a garage off Broadway/Woodward. Be mindful that on days where there are games, some garages cost more than others. The one I parked in had a flat rate of $10 on the weekend, so it wasn't to bad, plus it was right around the corner from the restaurant.Overall, we had a fantastic experience there and I really enjoyed my food. I will most definitely be back!"
4.5 star rating,"HELLOOOO DETROIT!While it is unfortunate it took me as long as it did to try out Dime Store, I am so glad I finally did! The Duck Bop Hash and the Gobbler Benny are incredible. As much as I love brunch, it can get pretty repetitive pretty quickly. Truthfully, how many different spins can you possibly put on eggs, potatoes, and breakfast proteins. Apparently, quite a lot, to my own surprise! More on that later.The Dime Store dons a catchy, cursive hipster sign at the base of the Chrysler House building. It is every bit as hipster as it looks, and I love it. The line to get in at 1pm on a Sunday afternoon spilled into a generous waiting area in the lobby of the Chrysler House building equipped with comfy chairs, high top tables/stools, and cushioned benches. While we were quoted a 1 hour and 15 minute wait to get in for a party of 2, we got called in at 40 minutes. And boy were we glad we waited!The menu was varied yet not overwhelming. While there were multiple items I had wanted to try, we ultimately went with the Duck Bop Hash based on a number of good reviews on here and the Gobbler Benny because of my Thanksgiving spirit. The Duck Bop Hash did not disappoint with its delicious runny egg, flavorful duck confit, pickled vegetables, and gochujang-y sauce, atop a bed of potatoes. And the Gobbler Benny is by far the most creative rendition of an eggs benedict dish that I've ever seen, and delicious at that! Perfectly poached eggs on top of turkey sausage and pan fried stuffing in place of an English muffin, all sitting in a bath of cranberry sauce--twas most excellent. The vanilla latte was also quite out of this world. An all around success as far as brunching experience goes and I cannot wait to come back to try some of their other offerings."
5 star rating,"My aunt and I were visiting Detroit for the the football game and decided to grab breakfast before we headed to the stadium. We both had their veggie hash, which was DELICIOUS. It was just the right amount of food and our waitress was lovely and super helpful. It's rather small, so if you don't like crowded places this spot is definitely not for you. Overall, I give this place two thumbs up! Great ambiance, friendly staff, amazing food, and Ford Field is within walking distance What more could you ask for??!"
5 star rating,"I think I will always love this place! It gets busy, but I think it's worth it! I've been coming here for about 3 years now and the food and staff are always above average! The atmosphere is great, it's hard to be in a bad mood here. Would highly recommend giving this place a try!"
5 star rating,"A really great brunch spot. We had the cheesesteak Benedict, parmesan bacon trifle fries, and my son had the peach crunch french toast, which was favorite! Their peach mimosa was perfectly refreshing. Would definitely go back."
4 star rating,"The food was delicious but holy moley was the wait insane for brunch! Waited for over an hour on a Saturday. Normally I'd say the food is worth the wait, but I was really hungry and brunchers like to take their time. They did mess up my drink order and give me two, so that was nice. If you've got plenty of time to spare and aren't particularly hungry at the moment, I'd say this is a good ""special occasion"" brunch place."
3 star rating,"Hands down to one of the best brunch places in Detroit. Expect 30 mins of wait time at the minimum. Try fruits or house potatoes instead of salads. Not that the salad is bad but others are better option overall.Few of my favorite dishes have been, smoked salmon Benny, duck bop and beacon avocado omelette.Tip: ask for separate mimosa and ice. You won't get ripped off of your drink (Bartenders secret), thank me later."
5 star rating,"This place has been on my yelp list for a year, I have tried a few times to come here but it was on the weekends and it was always a long wait. FINALLY I was able to go on a day off of work and I am glad I kept trying because the food was phenomenal. I had gotten the strawberry French toast and my husbands it the cheesesteak benny. Everything was great. If I am ever downtown on a week day I will be back."
4 star rating,"We've been trying to come here every time when we are in town visiting my family. It seems to always be slammed, which didn't use to be the case in downtown Detroit for restaurants a couple of years ago. But it's great to see the city bustling.Came here with three others. Shared two dishes with my gf. She got the pork belly eggs Benedict dish and I got the bulgogi and duck hash. Both were bomb.Cool to see a place in Detroit that has a menu with some Asian fusion to it."
5 star rating,"Best...breakfast...ever!  Enough said.  For those that have not eaten here, this place is worth driving into Detroit to experience.  Located in the Chrysler building, this restaurant is as hipster as one can get, but this place is not just show. Our table first shared their, ""Melted Belgian Waffle"" and it was amazing: freshly made waffle, soft and buttery, with local syrup that you can tell is the real stuff, not that fake sugary stuff you buy in supermarkets.  The waffle was already cut up into four hand sized slices, perfect for the four of us.My main breakfast entree was ""Cold smoked salmon sandwich"" with fried egg on brioche bun; I opted for their side of potatoes but one can order a side salad instead. This sandwich was also amazing: buttery, light brioche bun with a perfectly fried egg (with crunchy edges - yum!), chive cream cheese, onions, capers and arugula. Although the potatoes look really boring, the taste is really out of this world. They cut up the potatoes into really small, square pieces making them faster to cook and more edges that can be crisped up on the pan.Wish I can say the coffee was also out of this world, but it was decent, light coffee; (I prefer my coffee bold and robust, so it could just be my subjective preference).One other noteworthy thing: the clientele was really diverse. It has been 13 years since I last was in Detroit, and I am amazed at how ethnically diverse the demographic has become, and this restaurant was no exception. As a Filipina-American who grew up in California, that was really nice to see. Last shout out to our waitress, Christina: she was amazing!  Very courteous and chill, with really attentive but non-intrusive service. Much appreciated.  As a yelper who has eaten in so many places, this restaurant is my number one favorite breakfast place. A must eat.  (Note: the wait is usually an hour on the weekends.)"
5 star rating,I got the veggie omelet and added Dearborn bacon. Amazing omelet and the staff was super friendly / quick. Highly recommend and will be back when I'm visiting Detroit again.
4.5 star rating,"A DIMEond in the rough, this one. Was in Detroit for work and had a bit of time to go out and score some brunch and dime store served us up a delicious combo of breakfast foods and goodness. Located in a lobby of a building it's somewhat hidden, but the old timey vibe and hipster element makes all feel welcome. We sat at the bar and saw how generously they poured the bloody Mary's // always a nice touch! I had the waffles with turkey sausage and my boyfriend had the duck hash. Both were top notch. The duck hash looked amazing and I immediately regretted my decision but I was feeling a sweet breakfast on that particular day. All in all - fun atmosphere and good food. Fun place to grab some brunch downtown Detroit."
4 star rating,"We've been wanting to try Dime Store for a while, but due to scheduling issues, we never seemed to make it there. Until now. And I'm so glad we finally made the time for it. We came on a Saturday at 1pm hoping to have missed the busiest time. We did not miss it. We waited almost 45 minutes, but didn't mind is too much, as Bon Bon Bon is Also locates just down the Hall. If you must wait, wait with chocolate. Anyways, we did get in and sat at the bar, right in front of the kitchen. Now normally I would be afraid of sitting right in front of the kitchen where they're preparing this much food for this many customers, but this kitchen was on point. I was so impressed by the focus and warp speed that everyone worked with. They were churning out an incredible amount of plates, and doing so with care and precision and teamwork. There was no yelling or panic. Just incredible team work. I was impressed. Next, the device was top level. Yes, the place was insanely crowded and packed with hungry people, but our server gave us his undivided attention and was helpful and never made us feel rushed. He gave great suggestions and was very friendly. The food. Oh the food. I expected the food to be good and e plain the hype, but man. This place knows how to do flavor. Both of us ordered brunch like dishes and were both thrilled with our choices. We devoured our food and neither one of us spoke the whole time we were eating other than ""oh my gosh this is so good. You're not getting any."" All in all, we were thrilled with Dime Store and can't wait to come back and visit again. I personally recommend trying one of their seasonal dishes, as that was a highlight for me."
5 star rating,"We had plans to check out Belle Isle on a Sunday afternoon, so I found the Dime Store on Yelp and decided we should go there. We arrived at about 10:30am and were quoted a 45 minute wait. We put down our names and sat down in the lobby to check out our other options. Nothing within walking distance really stood out (we had parked the car already) so we decided to stay and wait. It took about 45 minutes, give or take. We were seated and greeted by our waitress, who offered us drinks. We both already knew what we wanted, so ordering was a quick process. I had the Cold Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict and BF had the Pork Belly Eggs Benedict. Both were really good - and came with a nice side salad. I really enjoyed my EB. The smoked salmon was very flavorful and tasted fresh (or as fresh as smoked salmon can be). Our food arrived in a timely manner and the prices were very reasonable. It's not a quiet or romantic place to have brunch, but it is very delicious and quick."
5 star rating,"Delicious spot for brunch. I had their salmon eggs benedict - delicious. Though I recommend getting some sides along with your meal, it wasnt substantial enough for me. I left feeling hungry. I will be coming back for another look during lunch. Overall I can't find anything wrong other than the menu just seemed sparse."
4 star rating,"Service has gone down the drain here. Three tables who put their orders in after us got their orders before us. The table next to us even commented that they got their food before us but they were sat after us.  We had to keep prompting our server, some douche bag in a ponytail, if our order was even put in.  The manager, delivered our food and didn't even address why it took so long to get our food until asked. She chuckled and rolled her eyes when I said we'd like better service.  That attitude rolls down to inattentive staff.  No apologies were given at all. Taking this place off the rotation.Sorry you and your ""fryer"" went down but ONLY for our table."
1 star rating,"I went to Dime Store around the time it opened. They started with a really solid, reliable menu and it has changed little since that time. Brunch and lunch options abound, including a smoked salmon eggs benedict, breakfast sandwich, or, my favorite, the Korean beef sandwich with an elegant side of mixed greens.Atmosphere is noisy. Service is fast and friendly. Rather lengthy wait for brunch on the weekends!"
5 star rating,"This place is a diamond in the rough. My friend and I made an irresponsible decision to make a round trip drive from Atlanta to Detroit and back in one weekend. I have to say we were taken aback at the scene when we rolled up to downtown Detroit. It was quite desolate. Not much going on. But then we found the dime store, and our faith was restored for downtown Detroit. Although space is tight, and the wait was a little long, it was all worth it for the brunch experience. I was sad that I couldn't have a drink while waiting but something tells me that's a city law they have to follow. I would say the brunch is on par to what I am used to in Charleston (compliment). The ambiance and decor kept me busy while waiting for our meal. It's beautifully decorated. If I ever find myself back in downtown Detroit, I will definitely come back!"
5 star rating,"Soooo gooood. Sooooo smallllll. Sooooo bussssssy. Once we got in the door, service is quick and courteous. It's pretty cramped, so don't expect to have an intimate conversation, but you can expect opportunity to people watch and eavesdrop! I had a duck confit dish with pickled veg, and a nice jammy red sangria. It was absolutely perrrrrfect."
4 star rating,"Amazing food, service and atmosphere! I highly recommend the duck bop hash. The wait was around 25 minutes to be sat down but definitely worth it. Our drinks and food came out quickly once they were ordered. Would definitely come again."
5 star rating,"My second time at Dime Store and my impression hasn't changed: This is THE spot in downtown Detroit for excellent grub and delicious drinks! For those who love brunch any day of the week, THIS is your place and you will LOVE it!!This time, I brought a buddy. She called her oatmeal, ""The best f*#%ing oatmeal {I} ever had!"" And yes folks, it was that good (I was given a taste!!). For me, I indulged in the veggie hash. Wow. The fresh vegetables- baby carrots, zucchini, corn, and a bright heirloom tomato salad adorned a plate that included 2 fresh eggs on top of the crispiest little paprika dressed spuds. Let me not forget the English muffin that came with a fresh side of homemade apple butter. Oh myyyyy.Hope you get to Dime Store at some point. I will always be sure to visit when my travels take me back to Detroit.Thanks, Dime Store team-- you guys ROCK!!"
5 star rating,"Delicious foodie heaven!! I read the other reviews and they were right- this place has fresh, delicious food- you cant go wrong with anything on the menu! I went in for a ""light"" lunch on a late Tuesday afternoon- ordered a side dish portion of mac n cheese with broccoli-- trust me when i tell you this was a full meal-- delicious béchamel sauce well-covering the elbow pasta. Well-seasoned. Wasn't over ridden with broccoli so you can really enjoy the mac and cheese.Super friendly service, great location, beautiful industrial interior.When I come back to Detroit, I'll be visiting the Dime Store again!!"
4.5 star rating,What a cool experience!  Sat at the bar next to where the prepared food comes out to the tables and watched the kitchen at work....and they were very hard at work. I had the Beef Chili with Cornbread Croutons (the croutons sold me on it) and had the B.LT.E. with avocado added on at the suggestion of my waiter.  Both of these were outstanding!  The chili was incredibly tasty and I wished I had ordered the bowl instead of the cup after I was done.  The sandwich was the highlight of the meal with a perfectly done bun (bread is sort of my thing) and bacon that I could've eaten another pound of.  The side salad was good as well.  Washed it down with a local IPA.  I'll definitely be returning for brunch/Lunch next time I'm in town.
5 star rating,Taste bud heaven!!! Best brunch place in Detroit. Perfect portions and everything was so fresh. I highly recommend the Korean fries!!!!! We also ordered the tortilla soup and it was so amazingly fresh. The cheesesteak benny was amazing as well. You should also try the peach mimosa and beer mimosa!! Amazing service and experience! They have an amazing nitro coffee too! Second time here was just as amazing as the first. I can't wait to come back again. Only thing I was mad about was that they no longer have the amazing tortilla soup!!

5 star rating,"Great brunch spot !! This is my first time in Detroit and the first place I stopped to eat. I went during lunch hour yet I was immediately taken to a table. I ended up getting the daily special of French toast which was delicious. My only complaint was that the toast was so thick and the syrup soaked all into it, so after I got thru half of it, it started getting soggy. The service was good, and the cooks were fast! Great atmosphere! Would definitely recommend for breakfast or lunch."
4 star rating,Fast. Delicious food. I would definitely return. The hot chocolate was good. Didn't care for the Lottie
5 star rating,"What a treat! It took me entirely too long to visit the Dime Store. Working and frequently visiting downtown Detroit daily, I've been intimidated to visit as there is always a line of people waiting to be seated and the restaurant always seems full and crowded. Today was my day! My co-worker and I made the last minute decision around 11am to go. When we arrived the restaurant was basically empty. Perfect! We were quickly seated and given menus. The abundance of vegetarian options was appreciated. We both chose the Veggie omelets which came with breakfast potatoes and toast. They were cooked to perfection. We waited maybe 10 minutes for our food, which was just enough time for the place to fill up. As we observed the room we were surprised to see how full the room got. So it's easy to say a sweet spot to visit for lunch and get quick service would be early 11am.Enjoy!"
5 star rating,Wow ! One of the nest brunches I've ever had. The Philly Cheesesteak Eggs Benny was to die for as well as the Korean BBQ Fries. The Eggs Benny had the authentic taste of a Philly Cheesesteak. All the flavors combined well. The Korean BBQ Fries was the perfect combo of salty and sweet. Absolutely delicious. Our waitress was so welcoming and friendly. This is a great restaurant that does it right
5 star rating,"A neat little breakfast place in the D, with food, drinks and decor that match the hype surrounding it. Although their menu is limited to breakfast foods, they are definitely good at it. Our order of a breakfast style old fashioned, cauliflower gruyere soup, veggie omelette and turkey sausage sandwich was anything but ordinary. The soup and side potatoes were slightly bland for my taste, but still enjoyable."
4 star rating,"Great service, great food, great atmosphere! Atmosphere is cute (although some may find it a tiny bit crowded). Service was super fast and attentive (constantly filling coffees and even giving us coffees to go, quickly clearing plates, etc). Food was also really good! I got the holiday fresh toast special with a delicious eggnog creme and apple butter filling. It was perfectly sweet and a great portion. My friends both really liked their dishes - an omelette and an eggs Benedict. Coffee is also really good as it is Zingermans! If I had one critique, I wish there was a bit more variety on the menu (particularly with more sweet items)."
5 star rating,"OUTSTANDING diner in Detroit!!! I travel quite a bit for work. I always look for a breakfast diner that offers the standard fare, but also some unique offerings. The Dime store did not disappoint! I was intrigued by the Duck Bopp Hash, but decided to order the Smoked Salmon Benny (Benedict). I have to say that my late dad made the best Benedict in the world, so I'm a bit particular in this area and will pass up a Benedict if it looks remotely average. I can't say it is the best Benedict I've ever had, only out of respect for my dad, but it beats the rest of the Benedicts I've eaten everywhere, hands down! The service was great and the staff was very friendly. There was no wait on this Friday January morning at 8:30. I will be back when I'm in Detroit for sure. Updated review: I did come back. Tried the Duck Bopp Hash and it was amazing! Service was awesome. Had about a 30 minute wait on this New Years Eve Sunday noon. If you have to wait (well worth it), you can grab a coffee at the counter and chill out in the warm lobby."

5 star rating,Wow. So good! I got the duck bop for breakfast and it was amazing. A fusion of French duck confit and Vietnamese flavor with the carrots. My only thing to the chef besides amazing recipe is that use slightly less sauce to cut down the saltiness.
4.5 star rating,"Best salmon salad I can remember in a long time. Salmon made with a maple glaze that's out of this world. Great staff, from the hostess, to the waitress and the cooks. Came on a Friday after the lunch crowd and got right in."
5 star rating,"I actually haven't been to Dime Store in over a year (a year, a week, and a day if you want to really count) bc I was over their bland/average food and long wait.  It actually felt like they had grown complacent and stopped caring about their food.  After a full year, I'm glad to report that Dime Store is off my ""do not eat"" list!! :DPros:- still loving the build your own omelette!! It's very filling- Coke products! I LOVE coke!- their bacon parm truffle fries are sooooooo yummy. ""It's 5 out of 5 stars!"" -my bf, who is well-trained in dating a Yelp elite girlCons:- breakfast potatoes are still frozen (I think. I've witnessed them throw frozen breakfast potatoes into the fryer multiple times), which can be a con if it really bothers you. It only bothered me when they didn't season them, but now they do!!- parking sucks- long wait on weekendsOverall, very glad I tried Dime Store again bc I can now continue to recommend it to others!!"
4 star rating,"Solid breakfast place!! It's right in the bottom of the Chrysler house with clearly visible signage. I made my own omelette with bell peppers, a little bit of cheese, and bacon. This came with some hash browns (they're actually some diced potatoes) and toast. The 2-egg omelette was fluffy and filling, the potatoes were delicious, but the toast and its jam were just okay. Not a biggie bc I'm not a fan of toast anyways. I also noticed my food is kinda salty, which I've found to be pretty consistent with everything else I've tried in the Midwest.My friend got some kind of Benedict, which came with a side salad, and she really liked both. She said the eggs were cooked to perfection!Great service, very attentive wait staff, and no issues wih wait time at all (everything came out in a timely manner). I'm glad to have discovered this place and can't wait to come back!"
4 star rating,"Great atmosphere, wonderful responsive staff, mediocre eats. I arrived for lunch to find the restaurant brimming with activity. Happy faces indicated this was their regular go to. I ordered an avocado omelette. The eggs were over cooked and cold, with the toast underdone and just 1/4 of an avocado. It was as though my dish was sitting back on the kitchen tarmac to time arrival. That creamy custardy center that is the signature of a perfect classic French omelette and the great flavor that comes with an Italian frittata (an Italian style omelette) both were missing. A local tangy feta sub for the dusting of cheddar might provide the magic needed for the timing to correct. The staff was incredibly positive and quick to try to fix things, so it was easy to fall in love with this spot."
3 star rating,"I really enjoyed brunch with two of my friends at Dime Store in Detroit. I got the Lox Eggs Benedict and the hashbrowns and it was heavenly. The menu is huge with lots of variety, and the atmosphere is adorable. We expected to wait for a while since we went on a weekend, but surprisingly got seated within 15 mins! It's crowded but as long as you don't mind getting friendly with your neighbor it's all good. The coffee was great too, and they offered a to-go cup. Great service."
5 star rating,"No joke, I have a major crush on this place. It's the best breakfast I have had EVER - and I promise you this is a very serious statement. We all know that breakfast is my thing, and we all know I'm a snob... how this place managed to top the list is this: amazing food, amazing staff, and amazing booze. Yep, that's what they did. Jerks.Food: I have dreams about eating the duck confit hash or reuben. I gaze off into the distance and imagine the pork belly bene hitting my palate. The truffle bene special (of course we had to add pork belly to that) was spectacular. So fresh, and truffles - yes please. And come ON with those brussel sprouts! I want those every day. Portions are perfect, I leave feeling full. If they were bigger, I'd leave feeling like I needed to vomit b/c there's no way I'd be able to stop myself from polishing off the plate. Really, you might see me in this restaurant licking the plate. I'm a little ashamed, yes - but a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.Staff: We had this waitress (Paige), she told us the best stuffs to order, she chatted us up, had a spectacular sense of humor. She even remembered the next time that we came in (a month later) that my friend had to go to his nephew's piano recital. She said to him, ""How was the recital?"" Really? That's a woman taking her job seriously - and rocking that job. I'm glad that I got to participate.Drinks: beermosa? Yes please. Delicious coffee, check. Add a little Bailey's? Sure, why not. Alcohol version of root beer and a cookie for dessert? Why the hell not?One thing to watch out for: the windows there get a nice blasting dose of sun in the AM and there aren't any shades. We sat at a table, were being blinded, and then the host gave us an attitude about wanting to change seats (easy, Detroit, with your new hipster attitude). They could fix that with a little shade action for the morning crowd - I mean, okay it's not sunny in Detroit all that often, but doing retinal damage over the weekend while trying to shove duck, pig, and beermosa down my gullet is not my idea of a good time."
5 star rating,This place was awesome! The food was delicious and even though we got it to go it was still fresh and enjoyable when it got to our hotel.
5 star rating,"Heard a lot of great things about the breakfast here. Since I came for lunch, I decided to get a Veggie Burger and fries. I was honestly disappointed in both. The veggie patty had literally no flavor. The fries also had no salt or seasoning. Was especially disappointed after seeing Michael Bolton loved his veggie burger here (eatdimestore.com/dime-st…).However, my friends really enjoyed their sandwiches and brunch dishes here, so this was probably just a bad first experience. They have the atmosphere down for sure. Nice ""instagrammable"" / ""foodie"" restaurant with a classy hipster vibe. You'd have to wait 45 minutes and pay 2-3x the price for something like this in New York or SF, so I can appreciate the accessibility to the community. I do envision this place getting busier and busier as more people move downtown, though. I might update this review the next time I go. Definitely give it a shot. Just do yourself a favor and don't get the veggie burger."
3 star rating,"Ok.. so I may receive flack for this but here goes.. Dimestore is SOOO worthy of a five star review. Why? Because the food is AMAZING... the service is STELLAR... the vibe is ON POINT.. and the location is THE BOMB; however, I am unable to rate this a five star at the present moment because of the following reasons: 1. During lunch hour a person can not be seated until all of the party is together. Huh?? Isn't that the point of being the first to be seated? TO SECURE SEATING INSTEAD OF WAITING?? 2. It is SUPER SMALL... the tables are smashed and I feel as though when a party is attempting to leave someone's big ass always bumps my drink, hand, or table.. not cool.. especially when manners are lacking! 3. I always leave smelling like I cooked the food myself. A mix between fast food joint and a smoking unkept stovetop with burning grease. Not cool when I have a super important meeting to attend afterwards.. The food is great, however, so if one is able to muster through my aforementioned nuances.. give them a try if you have not already :)"
4 star rating,"This is a great place for brunch.  I've been here twice and can't wait to return.  It can get crowded but we've been fortunate that we haven't had to wait for a table.  Like most good brunch spots I've been to, it's small and the tables are too close.  But hey I'm friendly so I can strike up a conversation with the neighboring table if need be.  Both times I've had the pork belly sandwich (pblt) and added smoked Gouda. This is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  Delicious!  We've also had the bacon, parm & truffle fries both times. I tried my friend's pork belly benny and breakfast potatoes and liked them as well.  I want to try other dishes here, but I can't let go of the pork belly sandwich and the bacon, parm, and truffle fries. Maybe I will venture out on my next visit."

4 star rating,"I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said. Hands down, best breakfast/brunch for me in Metro Detroit. And the lunch is just as delicious. I really like this place because it has fun with their brunch. You can get a standard breakfast...or you can get a chef's special that would include something like...say, a coney dog benedict. It's whimsical but not at the expense of quality. Their cooks/chefs have the chops to execute a delicious meal. My main quibble is the wait. Expect to wait for Sunday brunch. And wait some more. Are you still waiting? Yeah you are. We took spots at the bar because waiting for a table would guarantee an even longer wait time. The space is not in any way large. I felt quite claustrophobic. I do not know if it is their intention to move to a different space but I would be excited to hear if they are. I don't think that's enough to knock it down a star; the food is still very solid. Not that you'd be thinking about food after your meal, but Dime Store is in the same building as BonBonBon's downtown location and I would recommend stopping in either before or after your meal for some treats."
4.5 star rating,We waited for 35-45 minutes to be seated.  Was is worth it?  Yes.  I had the bacon avocado omelette.  The house potatoes was some of the best I've had.  Service was good.  The hot chocolate was good.  Wife had the sausage omelette and she enjoyed it.  Would I go back?  Yes

5 star rating,"UPDATE:After my initial bad experience here, the Manager (owner?) Ann-Marie reached out and wanted to make it right. She was pleasant and asked for details regarding when I got the Salmon as they wanted to ensure freshness as well.  They also provided me with a gift certificate to go back and try again.  I will definitely look forward to going back and trying another lunch!  I will definitely say this was A+ customer service!!!  I have had companies before state they will send a gift card and never provide one. It is also NOT my intent to get free things. Typically if I have a poor experience I just never go back.  I do believe sometimes businesses can just have bad days, after all it's run by people who we all have bad days, but knowing a business values the customers experience and input is appreciated.So thank you Ann-Marie for reaching out and providing great customer service. I will look forward to trying the Salmon salad again!...........................................This was my first time getting anything from the Dime Store. I opted for the salmon salad. Myself and a couple co-workers ordered. I will say the salmon was very underwhelming. There was no seasoning to it whatsoever. It was also very fishy smelling which, if the salmon was fresh shouldn't have that strong of a smell.  I would not order this again for $14.00 salad. Not to mention the salmon piece was exceptionally small. I've gone to other restaurants in the area who have served 5oz sizes for the same price. On a side note my coworkers ordered sandwiches and shared their fries with me which were good. I guess that's a partially redeeming aspect of this failed lunch"

2 star rating,"The history of the Chrysler House building that Dime Store is in represents a nod to its past where the building was occupied by the Dime Savings Bank and you could open an account with only a dime. When you first enter Dime Store, it maintains Detroit's hip, grungy modern vibe with exposed brick as a tribute to industrial design. I had the Duck Bop Hash (~$12) which was absolutely delicious! Visiting from out of town LA, the price can't be beat and there was a generous portion of duck. When the waiter came out to serve me, I realized this dish was very Korean fusion brunch with english muffins, runny eggs, pickled veggies, and duck. The flavoring of the duck is drool-worthy, with a nice tang of spiciness and is extremely packed with taste! It also came with a side of jam which made it a great combo of spicy and sweet atop cubed potatoes. I would recommend all visitors to come try. Sadly, does not accept Apply Pay."
5 star rating,"Stepped in here during a hectic morning - had 20 minutes for breakfast and this place delivered. Funky small diner-like spot nestled in downtown. Sat at counter and service was fast yet congenial. The special was a chicken bbq hash with poached egg and creamed corn. My god it was good - tremendous combo of flavors and I loved the interplay of bbq, corn, broccoli rabe, sweet potato and onion . Biscuit was also solid and coffee was strong and perfect .Highly recommend!"
5 star rating,"Duck Bop Hash sweet and spicy.  English muffin stale for my taste...I'm sure others let it soak in Strawberry jam, not me.  Potatoes cubed, need to soak too.  The Duck, egg and veggies- great.  Sat at the counter by myself while hard working women and men only had a moment to glance up to acknowledge my close presence on the other side of a glass separating counter.  Loved the atmosphere."
4 star rating,"Only visited twice, but I must say I'll definitely be back again. I love their brunch and the Korean fusion they offer like Korean fries and the duck bop hash. I always have to order the pork rinds each time I visit too. Another item I highly recommend is their seared Brussel sprouts.I've only gotten cocktails once so far, breakfast old fashioned and a Bloody Mary. Both were well made.Its a very busy restaurant and the location is a bit small. Be prepared to wait an hour minimum if you're coming for brunch on the weekends."
4 star rating,Worth finding parking to get here. Cool ambiance. Decor inside is edgy and creative. Beermosa and mimosa hit the spot. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Food was fire. Spicy Benedicts were awesome.. pork belly was delicious. Chef special kung pao chicken hash was also great. I hope to be coming back again soon. This place was WELL worth the drive into downtown for two not from Detroit Detroiters.
5 star rating,"The food here is so so good! I can proudly say that I'd try just about anything on the menu. It's that good. It's downtown location it's convenient. I've gone twice now with friends. I wouldn't recommend large groups of people because the restaurant is tiny and intimate. Due to this, there's been a small wait each time I've gone to the restaurant. The prices are affordable, especially for the the type of food that's served. I've only gone for brunch so I'm not quite sure rather or not they serve dinner foods. Credit cards and cash are both accepted. The restaurant does not have parking available. I had to find street parking and walk."

5 star rating,"Brilliant! Great service, friendly, and delicious! We went for breakfast (but a bit later in the morning because this place can get busy) and everyone enjoyed the flavors and atmosphere. Definitely an attraction in downtown Detroit!"
5 star rating,"Expect a long wait time but worth the wait. It's a cozy place small but fast pace.Great service and the food is delicious don't forget to get biscuits. I went with the cold brew, French toast and side of turkey sausage. They also have local beer that I was able to indulge. Breakfast done right"
5 star rating,"Soooo gooood. Sooooo smallllll. Sooooo bussssssy. Once we got in the door, service is quick and courteous. It's pretty cramped, so don't expect to have an intimate conversation, but you can expect opportunity to people watch and eavesdrop! I had a duck confit dish with pickled veg, and a nice jammy red sangria. It was absolutely perrrrrfect."
4 star rating,"After trying to eat here for what seems like forever...we finally had breakfast here and it was awesome! Loved there daily specials: a Korean bbq chicken thigh, slaw, hash and (we requested) soft scrambled eggs. It's was . The strawberry French toast was perfect. A thick cut bread that was perfectly cooked, a little custardy but not mushy"
5 star rating,"Popular for a good reason. The food is fantastic, well prepared and unique. Service is fast yet friendly and relaxed, which means that nobody is rushing you. The interiors are also unique, with quirky art. The duck bop hash is my favorite but there are chef specials that don't disappoint either. They also serve Zingerman's coffee and have lots of drink options for brunch. It is small though and they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait unless you come when it opens (8am)."
5 star rating,Good vibes and atmosphere. Food was great highly recommend the strawberry French toast.
4 star rating,"The food is delicious. Love the duck bop and cold brew coffee with chocolate. I would say it is more like American Asian fusion. Very modern nice and city like interior design. I feel like I'm eating my brunch in New York. Very nice location, there is a garage parking right across the restaurant, and there is e-scooter everywhere that you can download the app and take the scooter to the river where you can see the Canada."
5 star rating,"I had high hopes for this place especially since I waited twice for over an hour to eat here. I was disappointed. I had the Croque Madame Benny and was not impressed, the potatoes were completely cold and the Benny had very little flavor. The Mac n cheese tasted like a bad version of boxed Mac and cheese and the truffle fries were very thick cut which I'm not a fan of, and soggy. The blueberry French toast was the best part of the meal and it was sub par. I would recommend trying this place out if you're a mediocre foodie but for me, it just didn't satisfy any of my ""tooth's"" and was just okay."
2 star rating,Highly recommended.  Great food. Great staff. Great atmosphere. I have not been disappointed with the quality/perception/taste of the food; I went outside my comfort zone and tried multiple dishes and they were all delicious. Only down side is the wait - which typically means the food is excellent.
4.5 star rating,I had breakfast here this past weekend. I am from NYC-I saw good reviews - and was not disappointed! Got there early so luckily no wait. Very good experience & friendly server. Best truffle fries ever!
5 star rating,"Best salmon salad I can remember in a long time. Salmon made with a maple glaze that's out of this world. Great staff, from the hostess, to the waitress and the cooks. Came on a Friday after the lunch crowd and got right in."
5 star rating,Theres a wait for a reason people. This place is out of the park for brunching. Amazing food and great drinks!
5 star rating,"I'll be quick: the coffee was a huge disappointment. It was weak and flavorless.  We actually sent t back and ordered the nitro cold brew, thinking that would surely provide the taste and power we seek.  It was definitely better than the drip coffee, but still lacked ""oomph"".  The food was good but also didn't knock my wig back.  Service was excellent. We come to Detroit often and know all the best spots around the city from our own explorations over the years, and our connections.  So we were excited to try this new spot that's been getting rave reviews.  I wish I could give a higher rating, but the coffee definitely killed it."
3 star rating,"Solid breakfast, as the reviews suggest. I had the pork sausage breakfast sandwich and it was good. Ask for a side of the apricot jam and put some of that on it. I love when breakfast comes with greens on the side. These were a little salty, but still okay.My dad built his own omelette with bacon, onions, green peppers and goat cheese. Goat cheese in an omelette is the move. The server accidentally mixed up my parents' omelettes at first and when my mom had to swap my dad's goat cheese omelette for her own veggie one, she was a little sad. I would be interested in trying the pork belly benny or the duck bop hash and any other day I would have. I was in characteristically in the mood for a breakfast sandwich that day - no regrets."

5 star rating,Special. Spicy pollo loco hash. Coffee.Zingerman's coffee. Great special. Cool atmosphere. Great service. Great addition to downtown Detroit!
5 star rating,"The Dime store is Deff top of the list for breakfast places in Detroit. I have tried the omelets the breakfast sandwiches, but the Benny's take the cake. Today on special was the croque madame and it was nothing short of delicious. Each bite leaves you wanting more with wishful thinking of being able to make the plate at home (probably impossible). I have never had a cold brew prior to the here, but the hype of nitrogen cold brew isn't just a hype.  I can't leave out the great staff! Everyone is so kind and helpful and just seem happy to be here. We have had Chrissy at our very first visit and DJ at our most recent; both a pleasure.  So.....If you're in the area of downtown Detroit even for a few hours, even if it's not ""breakfast"" time, I STRONGLY suggest paying a visit! You will not regret!"
5 star rating,"A few months ago, I stopped in for a coffee and cookie. It was an oatmeal cookie with cranberries and some other stuff I can't remember, but honestly, it was the best store bought cookie I have ever had! I finally tried a meal at this place after months of saying I would. I got the bacon avocado omelette. A bit pricey at $12 and change for carry out, but the ingredients were quality and worth it. The bacon in the omelette was crispy, plentiful, and flavorful. The cheese was delicious too. And they didn't skimp on the avocado. I got the multigrain ""toast."" I found it odd that it wasn't toasted, I'll request that next time. The house fries were good, nice and crispy."
5 star rating,"I've been tempted through their Facebook images for awhile and finally made my way to their restaurant. My only disappointment is that I hadn't stopped in there sooner!The restaurant space is on the smaller side, but quite inline with a brunch location. The place is exceedingly popular, so expect a small wait to be seated. Smaller groups will find space first. Don't pass up on bar seating -- still fun up there and the bartender was a delight to speak with today. Once inside...this place is hoppin! All the waitstaff were incredibly friendly and had smiles on their face despite it being near the end of a very busy day. I was also impressed with the cook staff wearing beard nets -- thanks guys!The food...oh the food was worth the wait. Our waiter directed our attention to the chef specials menu and we chose two meals from it; Croque Madame Benny and Blueberry Cobbler French toast    The eggs for the Benny were poached nicely and the hollandaise was delicious. The French toast well prepared -- not overly sweet, but sweet enough not to require syrup. Before I knew it...I'd eaten the entire plate. Looking forward to making another trek down there and trying something else on the menu. Thanks, Dime Store, for rounding out my afternoon out of the house!"
4.5 star rating,"I got the spicy belly benny which I thought was unique to use pork belly but the meat was a little bland. Also the poached egg was cooked too long. The service is friendly and the interiors are unique. It's a cute shop, but food wise it was only okay for me personally"
3 star rating,"I've been to the Dime Store a couple of times now and have been impressed each time.  Fries are legit, they are accommodating for substitutions (vegan and veg options available) and the staff is friendly. If you can get it, bar seating is probably the best option, especially considering you will probably have to wait for a table (you absolutely will have to wait for brunch). Downfalls are the paid parking and wait times, but if you pop into Bon Bon Bon the wait goes by quickly."
5 star rating,"Savory Brunch at its best!!!  Sure there are a few sweet choices, but with all the savory bites to choose from it didn't break my heart to pass them up!We stopped in this past Saturday (during auto show weekend, eek.), we were not downtown for the auto show, but apparently everyone else was.  We waited about 30 min for a table which wasn't bad.  We waited for our food for about 40 min.  Which is a wait, but they were really busy so we could understand.  I had (at my servers suggestion) the Cheesesteak Benny.  Marvelous!!!  Ah geez, it was so good!  Super tender steak, sweet onions, and american cheese with a poached egg that all gets coated in a velvety hollandase sauce! The hollandase was great!!  Served with a small green salad that was light and refreshing.My husband has the Duck Ruben.  The toast was nice and thick, loaded with duck.  He really enjoyed it.  The hand cut steak fries were very tasty too!My friend had the Korean BBQ sandwich.  It was incredible!  The sauce was nice and tangy!Beer selection was really good.  Service was very nice.  It was really busy and everyone seemed to be helping each other out.  Always nice to see that among a team!"
5 star rating,Get the SPICY BELLY BENNY! It's literally pork belly eggs benedict. It's got this nice pesto flavor that complements the pork belly. That pork belly is cooked so well that IT MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH! There is a line so expect to wait an hour. Eat a snack before you go. You might just want to go when they open. But it is worth the wait!
4 star rating,Duck hash and keylime french toast was delicious.  Nice space and good atmosphere.  Hit some bikes and did a quick spin around the area after.  Dont miss the guardian building and a show at the fox.
5 star rating,Enjoyed the most fabulous confit duck bop hash at this equally fabulous gem of a place to dine. Wow!
5 star rating,"This brunch place is a favorite of mine in downtown Detroit. They do offer validated parking, so be sure to take advantage of that as parking can sometimes be difficult. We ordered the spicy korean fries as an appetizer, and I highly recommend it! It has the perfect blend of sweet and salty. We weren't too impressed by the spicy pork belly benny because the pork belly was lacking in flavor and was very dry. However, my duck bop hash was delicious! The radish on top, similar to the sweet radish that a lot of Vietnamese food has in their bahn mi or Bun, was a great compliment to the duck. It is definitely a must try for any first-time goers."
4 star rating,"The food here sounds better than it is but it is good. What really makes the place is the staff, each of whom is unique but they are all enthusiastic and genuinely interested in your having a good time. We had the pork rinds, the bibimbap salad and the cheesesteak. (All the sandwiches can be ordered ""as a salad"" with greens replacing the bread or bun.). Everything we ordered was fresh and well prepared but they didn't knock our socks off.  It doesn't matter when everyone is having fun. This place is worth a detour."

4.5 star rating,This is a cute restaurant in Downtown Detroit that serves breakfast and lunch. The apple Caramel bacon French toast was amazing( I didnt get the bacon). The Turkey sausage was the best I have ever had. It was moist and seasoned well. And my over easy eggs were perfect. The coffee was strong but not overbearing on the taste. The staff was friendly and attentive.
5 star rating,My wife and I checked this place out for breakfast in downtown Detroit while we were visiting and loved it! We both got great drinks (coffee old fashioned and beermosa) and had great breakfasts. It was pretty crowded when we went but that did not stop the service from being good. Our waitress quickly greeted us and our drinks and food came quickly too. And they were able to validate our parking for the parking garage that is attached to the building where the restaurant was. Overall and a great experience and will definitely be back to next time we're in Detroit.
5 star rating,"Absolutely fantastic food and service and definitely worth the 45 minute wait for a table. We started with a hot chocolate, mimosa, and bacon, parmesan, and truffle fries that really helped get the appetite going. Highly recommended fries, definitely something to get if you love fatty bacon. For the meal, I got the Spicy Belly Benedict with pork belly and a side salad. The meal is not so spicy that it would upset a hungover stomach, so it's perfect! The eggs were poached to perfection, and the salad was an excellent companion to the fattiness of the pork belly and hollandaise sauce. My friend ordered the biscuits and gravy and eggs--also very delicious and portioned very nicely. If you're looking for a place to take a friend from a bigger city, Dime Store is an excellent place to show off what Detroit really has to offer."

4 star rating,"This is a very nice basic classic breakfast restaurant. Service was friendly, coffee and cappuccino was   terrific.  I had the special French toast my guest had a very simple egg breakfast and coffee. Overall good food, strawberry rhubarb French toast was terrific. I was upset I missed the blueberry lavender French toast a few weeks ago. It is kind of loud for a  business meeting but not to bad. They  have a small alcove to hold 6 people for small group too. Only reason it's not a 4 is limited menu. But I did like they give you a parking voucher otherwise parking in the D is difficult and expensive at times."
3 star rating,"NO NEED TO CONTINUE READING, just do yourself a favor & go. The place isn't huge so there's usually a wait to be seated...but it's worth it. I ordered the El Toro Rojo: 2 poached eggs with hollandaise, housemade chorizo, tortilla strips, white cheddar, salsa roja, & pico de gallo w/a fruit bowl. We also ordered the Spicy Korean Fries  shaved steak, bulgogi, siracha mayo, pickled veggies & a SOFT PARADE BEERMOSA  to wash it all down."
5 star rating,"Ever since the Dime Store was slated to open in Detroit I have been pretty eager to try them. I love a good brunch place.  However there are so many great brunch places I knew they had some stiff competition. I waited off a few months so they could fix some of the new restaurant kinks. I was pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere and food.  We ordered a nice sample. First up, the cauliflower Gruyere soup topped with fried onions.  I thought this was pretty delicious. I would definitely get this again.We had such a hard time deciding if we should get the korean BBQ sandwich, duck hash, or spicy korean fries. They all were relatively the same in ingredients. We landed on the fries... Omg. These guys were so good. I see why people love the korean BBQ sandwich now. The beef and the pickled veggies along with the mayo and other sauce really made this unique. I love fries and this is a definite ""get again"" order. I may even ask for extra beef and veggies and make this a meal. The duck Reuben on rye was huge! It came with pickled cabbage, stone ground mustard and arugula. This was also a winner! Totes worth the price. The one thing is the sandwich didn't come with a side. We ended up ordering the brussel sprouts which are always a good choice. However they weren't good this morning. Being a salt lover I don't usually mind if things are a bit over salted but these were inedible. So we didn't  finish them. We did tell the waitress that they should tell the kitchen. I'm sure once they tasted them they would understand that the balance is off.  We were kind of bummed that we paid for them. No big deal because they were only 4 bucks but added onto the 13 dollar sandwich and it was a 17 dollar meal.Last item we ordered was the sausage hash. I'm going to be completely honest... I'm pretty sure I wouldn't get any of the hashes again.  Pretty tough on breakfast hash. I kind of walked in already knowing this was going to be just an average potato meat mix. It was ok. Nothing to write home about. I think it needed more seasoning or .... ? It just lacked flavor in my opinion. The gentlemen sitting a few seats down from us got the duck hash and it looked good. I'm sure it was since it had some of the same ingredients as the fries. Next time I'll try a Benny! All in all a good experience. Come early! We just made it past the long wait. When we walked out there were tons of people waiting. We got there a few minutes after it opened and almost didn't make the first round of seating.*****Edit*****The message from the business below shows good business practices and an overall want to make the customer experience positive. This is something that many new restaurants lack. I will be back to checkout the other breakfast items, but I'm pretty excited to try more of their sandwiches!"

3 star rating,"My food connoisseur and I decided to visit the infamous Dime Store. Following a few of our waiter's recommendation and yelpers' reviews, we ended up ordering the Chicken Tortilla Soup, Spicy Korean Fries, Duck Bop Hash, and the Spicy Belly Benedict. Although all of our food were extremely flavorful, we were only truly impressed by the Spicy Belly Benedict.  The flavors really came together well with that dish and the pork belly gave it a really nice twist with its crunch. The marination of the shredded duck meat for the Duck Bop was too overpowering for our taste.  Overall the Duck Bop and the Spicy Korean Fries tasted too much like the vietnamese banh mi tit nuong.- M"
4 star rating,"Clean place, friendly staff. I've been here 2xs and the food is ok. It's not bad, it's just didn't tickle my fancy."
4.5 star rating,"This place just has it going on.    Almost always a wait (in the 3 times I've been) but well worth it.    The seating sometimes affords little or no privacy, as your two-top is often immediately adjacent to another--which is I guess a positive as they're still ""getting you in.""The ingredients taste exquisitely chosen and fresh.    The servers seem a little aloof after food delivery, but it's above average overall."
4 star rating,"How has it taken me so long to discover this great restaurant within walking distance of work?  No matter, I know of it now.Boasting an modern, industrial vibe and a full bar, and serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner, The Dime Store is a trendy, trending place where you'll find an interesting mix of business people, hipsters, and tourists.  The co-worker who introduced me to this nearby treasure has been there multiple times, each time trying something new and ""never"" getting anything that wasn't good.  On this visit, he chose the chicken salad sandwich, which he described as ""out of the ordinary"" and ""good"".I opted for the PBLT and the spicy korean fries, each of which could have stood on its own as a lunch.  The PBLT was porkbelly, lettuce, and tomato, served with mayonnaise on a hearty, toasted and buttered, white bread.  Yum!  The spicy korean fries were topped with korean bbq beef and smothered in sriracha may.  Double Yum!The third person in our party opted for breakfast for lunch and got the daily special - two eggs any style (he chose over medium) with sausage and toast.  Both the eggs and sausage were underdone for his taste; he didn't eat the sausage, but he said the eggs (over easy) were good and the toast was wonderful.  Had it been me, I would have sent the sausage back for more cooking...We walked over from work for lunch, and an early lunch at that, so drinks weren't on our menu this time.  The Dime Store does have a happy hour, which I am certainly going to try out soon.  Yay!  Another great choice in downtown Detroit."
4 star rating,"I went here visiting from Chicago for the Movement Festival. I've got to say this place is cute, quaint, super friendly and family oriented. I felt at home. The food is delicious! The location is perfect, and the wait was well worth. I would definitely visit this place again when I go to Detroit."
5 star rating,A fun and original breakfast/lunch spot in downtown Detroit.  You may have to wait up to an hour for a table but there is a good and warm  lobby to pass the time.  The Menu is amazing and their specials can be wild!  A must try while in Detroit. Not perfect stars as my last visit the order was messed up and one dish was not warm.
4 star rating,"We came for Easter brunch fully expecting a line but not the two hour one that was estimated for a table for two. We were debating whether or not to stay but I had the idea to do take out and sit at the multiple tables/benches outside of the restaurant which cut our wait time to about 20 minutes.The lady who took our order was super friendly and thorough so points for that especially since it was just a takeout order. We ordered the housemade sausage breakfast sandwich, seasonal veggie hash, brioche french toast, and half order of Korean fries. The worst was definitely the breakfast sandwich. The patty had a weird texture and the seasoning wasn't the best mix - I would've rather had a Jimmy Dean-esque sandwich. The Korean fries were ok - they needed a sauce to tie everything together (pro tip dime store: take a look at oh my gogi in Houston). Brioche french toast was good but I haven't seen anybody mess up french toast so I wasn't blown away. The seasonal veggie hash was definitely a surprise in how good it was but could have used more salt. All in all, I'm glad we didn't wait 2 hours for the food because it would not have been worth it at all especially considering how small and loud the space was. Ok brunch place though."

We have had Chrissy at our very first visit and DJ at our most recent; both a pleasure.  So.....If you're in the area of downtown Detroit even for a few hours, even if it's not ""breakfast"" time, I STRONGLY suggest paying a visit! You will not regret!"
5 star rating,"Found this place on Yelp during a business stay.  Hard to describe but who cares when the food is excellent.  Started with he cauliflower soup served in a mug.  Creamy an delicious.  Then grabbed a beer. Yes they have a full bar. Finally the Korean BBQ fries.  Fries cooked well.  Meat done nicely.  Sauce was a touch bland for me but I like spicy so ""normal"" people will love it.  I added a bit of sriracha sauce for kick. Service was great.  Different people checked on my and were very nice. Highly recommend for lunch if you are downtown in the motor city."
4 star rating,The space is a little tight. It the food was on point. My friends and I really enjoyed our meal! I had the Benny and it was delish!
4 star rating,Amazingly good breakfast spot! Benefit philly was so good definitely recommend. Drinks were delicious and staff were so nice. Everyone wore masks and constantly we saw our server using sanitizer! Great spot
4.5 star rating,"I've had a ""draft"" of a review sitting on here for over two years. I never fully know what to say about Dime Store and keep thinking nothing I could say would ever compare to my experiences there. This is the best brunch spot I've ever been to. Hands down. I will fight you about this. You will lose. The entire team at Dime Store is phenomenal. They will give you the inside scoop on Detroit, they'll help you find the shuttle to the game, they'll give you tips on dinner spots and dive bars -- they treat you like a good friend the second you walk in the door. I'm a regular at Dime Store and know quite a few people by name, I've never had less than VIP treatment and always rave about this place. I once had two friends in town from Indiana and when we sat down at the bar at Dime Store they were completely blown away, I mentioned to the bartender that I wanted to show them the best brunch in the city and all of a sudden a few apps we didn't ordered were presented in front of us. We were treated like royalty, and not because they wanted return visits later (I was already a regular and my friends are from too far away for Dime to get much of a return on investment from the complimentary apps we received) they simply wanted my friends to have a great experience and they did.Pro-tip: Ask for the non-alcoholic old fashioned. Made with nitro cold-brew and orange and chocolate bitters PHENOMENAL."
5 star rating,"Let's begin with the fact that I appear to enjoy waiting for food.  Well let's just say here is one place you should wait on.  Was seated at the bar both days and it's amazing to see all that goes on with everyone behind there.  Cooking on the grill has everyone doing their part, the bar area has their part to do, and everyone is happy with their job.  Getting to the main issue you would love to know, the food is delicious and fresh.  It's not much else to say other than to visit this place and see for yourself.  For those not from the area, it's located in the Dime Building and fittingly named the Dime Store.  You won't regret this visit when you come to Detroit."
5 star rating,"Lunch and breakfast items available. And a long list of sides available! Although, it is usually very busy because of its small space, the wait is not too long. Nice location in the Chrysler building downtown. I had Cheesesteak with shaved steak, onion, and American cheese on hoagie. Withheld shiitake and oyster mushroom. And a side of Mac and cheese made with white cheddar and smoked Gouda, topped with bread crumbs and chives, with added Brussels sprouts."
3 star rating,"My husband and I visited the Dime Store on New Years Day to start our new year off with a new restaurant. I  heard about the wait but I figured since we got there 30 minutes before closing that it wouldn't be one. Boy was I wrong! However, we were assured, by a very friendly hostess, that we would be seated regardless and in 35 minutes and that we were. We were greeted immediately by our server Ryan. He was Great!! Not once did he make us feel rushed or like they were supposed to be closed. I ordered the cauliflower soup and the Cheesesteak Benny. My husband created his own omelette and ordered the Bacon Apple Waffles. MMMM MMMM GOOD!!!! Everything was so DELICIOUS  and SATISFYING! No complaints. The wait was worth it and the service was EXCELLENT! We officially have a favorite breakfast spot! Please believe the hype!! Everything exceeded our expectations and we will be back!!!!"
5 star rating,"Yelp, you have deceived me. After Movement, we were starving. Honestly, our standards at that point were quite low. I saw Dime Store had 4.5 stars so we decided to go for it. My first warning should have been the fact our Lyft driver, a Detroit lifer, had never been. Still, we went. Coffee was burnt. Like super bad. Plus they have creamer instead of real cream, always a bit of a deal breaker for me. We ordered the duck hash, pork belly Benedict, and waffle with fruit. The duck hash came with these sad lil potatoes and a sickly sweet syrup. Duck confit was...not deserving of that name. The Benedict was eh...dry pork belly, but probs the best of the bunch. The waffle was 1) soft 2) tasted like an Eggo 3) was an extra $2 for about 6 slices of fruit...like what??Honestly, an entirely regrettable meal..."
2 star rating,"I had one of the breakfast specials and it was phenomenal. I had the key lime pie French toast. Also had the amazing Korean french fries. That is a must try!!! When I come back to Detroit Michigan I definitely will come back here. Great friendly service, good prices and amazing food"
5 star rating,The service was pretty good here and the food is different and good. The duck Ruben has a unique taste because of the pickled cabbage but it is tasty. The mustard is homemade and the duck isn't plentiful. You want to get the Mac and cheese. Next time I visit I'll get the Mac and cheese add chicken with a waffle. It'll be the perfect combination.
4 star rating,"I wasn't very impressed for my first outing. It took a while to get a table. We were sat somewhere where awful lighting was blinding my friend. The food:Cold smoked salmon benny: I didn't think that even the muffin would be cold. It was a much colder experience than I anticipated and I guess that's not really my fault on this one.Veggie Hash: Good, but nothing too incredible.Sweat Poached Pear Salad: Quite sad.Brussel Sprouts: Phenomenal. Absolutely incredible.Anyway, this may not have been the best greeting, but the brussel sprouts were enough to have me very much on board for exploring the menu further. I'll be back."
3 star rating,"Yum!  This is a small place but VERY delicious! I ordered a special of the day, a Toro omelet, it was AMAZING!  Heads up - They wait until your entire party has arrived before they seat you but they will save your place in line until they arrive... My friend was late the day I went but we were seated pretty quickly after she arrived.I would have given this place a 5 but the service wasn't great... The waitstaff is friendly but we never saw our waitress I ran out of water and orange juice and it was like 30 minutes before we saw her again so I could ask for a refill. Plus she didn't stop by our table for like 10 minutes after our food was delivered to check on us and my friend needed cream and sugar for the coffee she ordered and we needed ketchup and the corn chips strips were missing from our omelets we ordered."
3 star rating,"I have to admit that I am not the biggest Detroit fan, I mean I'm a Chicagoan, but this place was good and was worth the long wait. The best part about the wait is the atmosphere, it was nice and warm inside the building which is all you can hope for on a cold December Sunday. I definitely snapchatted my way through the wait, lol! I swear I wanted to order everything off the menu but we contained ourselves. The spicy Korean fries were to die for and French Toast is my Jam so I was so happy that their Brioche French Toast didn't disappoint. Needless to say if I ever find myself in Detroit again I will definitely be dropping back in to the Dime Store!!!"
4.5 star rating,"The brunch was insanely fantastic. I had the duck bop. The wait was long, but it was well worth it!"
5 star rating,Coffee was great! Brunch was good! Would definitely like to try them out again. Hopefully next time we won't have a too long of a wait!
4 star rating,"We had a 1 hour wait, and it was definitely worth it!   The building dime store is in is also where Drought and Bon Bon Chocolates are, so we enjoyed some treats while we waited.We ordered the duck rueben and the sausage hash because we couldn't decide between brunch and lunch!Both were really delicious.  Food is really good, fresh, cooked well.   The higlight of the experience though, were the spicy korean fries!  HOLY CRAP!  Must try!  These exploded with flavor, were not too spicy, and we couldn't stop eating them. Will be back if we are ever in the mood/in the area for brunch again."
5 star rating,"Great stop for brunch!! The French toast was amazing!! Melts in your mouth; had turkey sausage on brioche bun with egg whites, spinach and grape tomato! Excellent place; great service and reasonably priced!!"
5 star rating,Waited just over an hour for Dime Store this morning for a group of 5. It was worth it! I've visited a few times before and enjoyed great coffee and always try the menu specials. Today I had the apple caramel bacon French toast. A healthy portion a cooked to perfection! I also had a Bloody Mary that was decent but not the best I've had. The rest of my party had some variation of Hash and there were no complaints.
4 star rating,"Was in Detroit for 24 hours... and ate at two spots. Katoi and Dime Store. BOTH live up to the hype. Went here this past Saturday and had a bit of a wait (1 hour-ish). Restaurant has a building lobby connected so sit back, relax, and wait for them to call your number. Ambiance had a dope, chill vibe to it. Music was on-point, service friendly. Had pork rinds (OMG - so good! never thought about putting sriracha on them), duck poutine, and duck bop. Had a beermosa (forgot what Michigan IPA it was served with - definitely recommended) to top off the meal. Had no idea what to expect when visiting Detroit, but glad yelp landed me here."
5 star rating,"The Dime Store is a great place to go with groups- it's always fun to watch what everyone orders because the food is beautifully presented. I am giving this a 3 star on account of food flavor and price point. First my table had the avocado and tomato sandwich on a brioche bun and side salad. The bun was surprisingly delicious - we could not put it down! The side salad dressing was olive oil/ vinaigrette based and very light - good flavor. I did not regret ordering this, but probably would not order it again because the flavor didn't wow us.Next we ordered churro waffles which were our favorite. It had a light airy texture with a crunch from the cinnamon sugar - definitely recommend.Finally we ordered the housemade sausage hash. The meat had reminded me of a taco flavor and the potatoes were a little on the dry side for my taste. Again not bad, but did not wow me.Overall we had a good experience and the staff was very friendly :)"
3 star rating,"I LOVEEEEE this place!! It is always super packed so don't ever think that you can just pop in and get a quick bite. Having said that it is TOTALLY WORTH IT! The service is awesome and I have literally never had a bad item and I swear I have eaten half of the stuff in the menu. The kimchi fries are my favorite, share them with your table. You literally can't wrong!"
5 star rating,"I love the food here, just be strategic about the time you come--I avoid weekends if I can. The weekend wait is brutal, it can be over an hour. But the food is always tasty and fresh and they have carafes of mimosas! The service is always great."
4 star rating,"On a business trip so it's was worth getting up early to escape the breakfast included hotel offering.  Cheesesteak Benny was nice unique take on the Benny.  Biscuit was a sweet upgrade on the English muffin.  American cheese sly attention. Get a side of the local pork sausage patties.  Why are you still reading, you should be ordering!"
4.5 star rating,"This is my favorite brunch spot in Detroit! I love the Kung Pao specials and their mimosas are delicious. Their coffee is also so good and definitely a local roasted, just unsure of who! Definitely excited to come back"
5 star rating,"Came here for breakfast, to say I was disappointed is an understatement. We tried to order a salmon Benedict but they were out of it. Come to find out that was a blessing in disguise. A side of hollandaise was ordered with the avacodo, tomato, egg sandwich and it was cold and flavorless.Wait, did I say flavorless? That seemed to be the theme for the entire breakfast. My French toast was soggy and had zero taste. If I ate brioche covered in Elmer's paste it would have been no different than the hunk of paper maché that was dropped on my plate. If there was a plus to the morning it was the delicious coffee.  Won't be returning.D-"
1 star rating,"Came during lunch and got their steak and eggs (poached) for takeout. From ordering to getting my food, I waited about 10-15 minutes and my food was still when i got to the office.The steak was perfectly tender and flavorful. The bite sized potato hash was crispy and salty and the eggs were rich and had a soft yolk. If I lived in Detroit, I would definitely be a frequent customer!!"
4 star rating,Nice place to grab lunch. Breakfast hours are really busy. Good prices for quality meals.
4 star rating,"Today was my first time here with my boss and team.  The food was great! It is in the Chrysler House Building right on Griswold.  I had the House made sausage omelette.  I will be back for the Eggs Benedict! Great mimosas, Bloody Mary's, and coffee with Baileys Irish Cream. Yum! You may want to come early because this place will fill up quickly."
4 star rating,"Went on NYE for brunch.  At 11AM, it was a 40 minute wait for a table for 2 (and when we left around 12:30, it was the same)...so be prepared for a wait.  But the lobby outside the restaurant is very spacious, plenty of room to sit while you wait.Once seated, service was fast.  We split an order of Korean Spicy Fries, which are life changing.  I had an omelet which was enjoyable, though I wished I had read more of the menu.  My GF had the Spicy Belly Benny which is her standard and favorite breakfast.  Very good!Will be back to try more!"
5 star rating,"Honestly, this place is overrated. Not sure why everyone is so obsessed with it. There are much better places to eat around the area. I gave it another try and ordered the pesto chicken sandwich and it was dry, unseasoned, and should have def been made with a diff bread. No thank you, to anyone who tries to convince me otherwise and order from them again in the future. I'll pass."
2 star rating,"Superb!  Cheesesteak Benny was perfect, and I am picky about my poached egg and hollandaise!  The mixed greens were the perfect accompaniment.  My boyfriend got the Philly Sandwich and said it was the best he has EVER had (he is extremely fussy about ALL food).  The wait wasn't bad either, only 30 min.  Waitstaff all so bubbly and we sat at the kitchen bar seats!  Can't wait to come back!"
5 star rating,"Excellent food with great & fast service!I ordered from their specials menu and it was excellent (gobbler benny the first morning and it was so good, I came back the next morning to try the hangover burger)!Big Mike was a great server behind the bar & played an excellent auxiliary roll as DJ."
5 star rating,"I went here for brunch & it was pretty good. It was super busy so my pal & I got stuck in a tiny table in the middle of two parties, so it was less than ideal. Te good was tasty so I think I'll try coming again when it's less crowded to get the full experience."
4.5 star rating,Super awesome service! The BLTE is my absolute FAVE! Nothing bad to say about this cool place. Food is great and the staff is amazing!
5 star rating,"The one hour wait for Sunday Brunch was buffered by a trip to Bon Bon Bon.....  nice dark chocolates to take home for later.The Shrimp Harumaki roll was most delicious!   Shared that with Dan as an appetizer. I had the roasted Brussel Sprout salad with Duck leg confit.  Dan had the house made sausage hash. Along with Bloody Mary's, of course!Next time we'll plan it better so as not to be inundated with St Patrick's Day parade runners  Place was crazy busy!!"
4 star rating,Bland and Mediocre food. Im glad I didn't have to wait to be seated since it was just me because it would not have been worth the wait. My first and last time going there. There's definitely better brunch places in the area.
2 star rating,"The Dime Store was a fun, uplifting experience.  Sit at the bar and visit with Big Mike, he's a solid dude and made our visit extra special.  He recommended the Fries, but having just had fries he redirected us to the Chicharonnes, this was the correct move to make, lemme tell ya!  Still crackling upon arrival this pile of crispy delights did nothing but please. Chicharonnes are tasty enough to begin with, but the Dime Store went ahead and turned it up a notch with a drizzle of heat and for a double bonus, at the base you will find a tasty pool of flavor for dipping, sweet, spicy and just plain delicious.  We also had the brussel sprouts, cooked perfectly and lathered in a savory sauce, very nice.  Our visit was short and sweet, but certainly left a positive impact.  The entire staff was friendly and helpful.  I would love to try out the brunch scene here and plan to do so on my next visit to  Detroit.  We came during the late afternoon which proved to be a good time as it sounds like there is often a wait.  Sit at the bar if you can, make a new friend and watch the magic happen!"
5 star rating,"I was in Detroit for a wedding and came here for both Lunch and Brunch the following day because I loved it so much.It's a really cute restaurant downtown with decor. Had the Cuban sandwich for lunch plus spicy korean fries which were BANGIN'. Think a Bulgogi beef but on top of really good fries.For brunch, I had the cold-smoked salmon breakfast sandwich and shared peanut butter and jelly french toast which was on special. PERFECT combination of sweet and savory, which is exactly what you want for brunch. The french toast was so good that I am going to try and make it at home.To top it all off, the wait wasn't too bad for 7 people for brunch on a Saturday and the prices are really reasonable for how good the food is and how big the portions are. The Dime Store is doing it right!"
5 star rating,"Their homemade pork sausage is incredible and I wish I could have met the pig whose flesh was that exquisite to show him or her my love, appreciation, and gratitude.  The mimosas are generous, and Big Mike at the bar taught me that burying yourself in leaves to survive in the woods isn't as fun as it sounds.I actually went back here two days in a row, mostly because I was meeting someone at Hudson Cafe the second day which was unexpectedly closed, and this is nearby, and I was not sad about it at all."
5 star rating,"I ordered the Brioche French Toast, it had to be the best French toast that I've ever gotten from a restaurant! would recommend for anyone. Great decorations and service didn't take too long!"
5 star rating,"I've heard a lot of great things about this place but I'm rarely in the area early enough for breakfast/brunch. My friend was visiting from out of state and I thought it'd be a good opportunity to try it out.The place was packed but our wait was maybe 5min, tops. Service was great and the waiter was able to point out the most popular items, and give personal opinion. They also offer parking validation for the first few hours if you use the lot around the corner.Food was very good and the portions are generous."
5 star rating,"In our very small circle of peeps, Ray and I are the ones in the know when it comes to cool food spots. This being my first visit and review of Dime Store goes to show how very tiny our circle is. So here I am,  the nearly 1200th review, with just as many pictures, and I'm supposed to say something new, innovative, something that hasn't been said before?????‍‍‍. Mostly I'll say, ""I agree, that's for sure, couldn't say it better myself"". We had bacon truffle fries, yikes- super dangerous with bacon ""not so bits"". Duck bop hash- great, surprisingly much better the next day!!! Same can be said for the goat hash special. Chicken tortilla soup was passed around our party of four making everyone wish they got their own. Even the guests sitting around us made it a great experience. Nobody was mad while I ogled their plates and drooled accordingly. And indeed it was the gentleman next to us that convinced my husband to order the goat. Shout out to the server who brought drinks and asked ""do you NEED straws""? Hell no sister, we're saving the sea turtles, thanks for asking!!!! I guess I'll end with a small pleasantry that had nothing to do with food. Upon arriving, our wait time was 45 minutes, imagine my delight when we were sat in 23 minutes, now that is great customer service."
5 star rating,I love breakfast here.  Great food that has never disappointed  along with an A+ attentive wait  staff
4.5 star rating,"Cool little diner with quick service and amazing food. Not much more to say -- about as good as it gets for lunch in Detroit.I had the Korean Fries which, as everyone says, are absolutely delicious. Also had the Philly Cheesesteak which was very good.Can't wait to go back!"
5 star rating,"We made a visit to Dime Store for brunch while visiting Detroit, and it was a great choice! The service was awesome - all their staff are super nice and welcoming. It's also in a great location, right in the middle of downtown. I ordered the pork belly benny and my fiancé ordered the veggie scramble. Both were great! My dish had a ton of flavor! The food cane out pretty quickly as well. We attempted to go back a couple days later (on a weekend) and the wait was over an hour. Just a heads up for any of you who are looking for weekend brunch! I would def come back to Dime Store the next time we visit Detroit!"
5 star rating,"Love love love this place! It's in such a beautiful building and the food...Phenomenal. Not a single thing I would change, at least for the dish I had. I had the Veggie Hash. So good!!! Highly recommend. As well as a chai latte no espresso and orange juice. Everything was so good."
5 star rating,Great food and large portions.  Everyone at the table was very happy with what they had. Excellent breakfast selections. Sandwiches and sides were incredible too.
5 star rating,"Completely amazed by this place. I've started to have an expectation of these hipster places in Detroit; looks cool, expensive but low quality food. That was definitely not the case here. I walked away feeling I got exactly what I paid for.This place is located in the Chrysler Building. Its decently large with some cool decorations on the inside. A really laid back atmosphere with workers that complement the vibe they give off.The food was on point. I ended up getting a Smoked Salmon Breakfast Sandwich. AMAZING. This sandwich came with a grilled egg on it which added to the perfection. I was thoroughly impressed by the quality, as I am very picky with food and refuse to eat something I purchase if its not made right or something is off. This also came with a side salad. Not knowing at the time, but the side salad is substitutible with fruits or fries. My girlfriend ended up getting a salmon salad. This is something she doesn't normally get because they rarely turn out tasting the way the chef wants it to. This was a smash hit. Very tasty and the salmon was cooked as if it was done at a 5 star seafood restaurant.I will definitely be back here and have already recommend this place to a few friends before writing this up."
5 star rating,"I wanted to try everything!  So many unique things on the menu it was hard to decide but I settled on the chicken pesto sandwich with a side of macaroni and cheese, because let's be honest, who doesn't want macaroni and cheese?  Both dishes were extremely tasty!!  The atmosphere is cozy, and a bit loud.  Service is quick and super friendly!I highly recommend stopping by if you're in the area, I promise, you won't be disappointed!"
4 star rating,"Dime Store... I need my five cents back.  People say this place is great.  My experience is the service is good, but like many places in the metro area... the food is just okay.  Not bad... not saying that at all.  I just don't think, the food here... you have to try ...  Maybe if it wasn't so hyped bore I went, I would give it a higher score.  So I went a few more times.  Service is good.  The wait is long (very small place).  The food... decent.  So I still don't get the hype. Décor: 3 out of 5Food:  3 out of 5Drinks: NAService: 4 out of 5Cleanliness:  4 out of 5"
3 star rating,"O.M.G!! This place deserves more than just a regular 5 star rating. It was the best lunch we have ever had.We got to downtown Detroit unsure of where to go, after reading some yelp reviews, we decided to stop by the Dime store. It was around 11:45am and surprisingly there were only us and 3-4 other parties. Though after 30 minutes, the place was jam packed. What we ordered: 1. Tortilla soup - the soup came in a cup with tortilla on top. The portion was enough and the soup was so good! Highly recommended this for appetizer. 2. Duck bop hash - my gf really really liked it. It tasted a little sweet (from the seasoned duck), savory (from the upside egg) and spicy (siracha).3. Smoked salmon Benny - I really enjoyed the meal. Overall, 10/10 for the food quality and service. The waiters kept checking on us quite frequently to see if everything was alright. Even when the restaurant was packed, service was not slow either. The experience here was amazing! A must try in downtown Detroit!"
5 star rating,"One of my top places to go to for Brunch. Exceptional food and service. Highly recommend this place for anyone for Brunch. Take into consideration the wait time as it gets really packed on the weekends, but its so worth it after."
5 star rating,"I don't understand why this place is so well reviewed, everything about it is terrible.First, the food. The salmon burger is a pre-made patty that tastes overly salty. The fries are very dry. The duck bop had overly sweet duck that was super dry and tasted old. The potatoes that it came with were previously frozen tiny squares of blandness. The English muffin was hard as a hockey puck. The chicken pesto sandwich was an under cooked piece of chicken (super dangerous) on a bun with pesto sauce. It tasted flavorless. I really don't get the hype when not one of the three dishes we got were even mediocre.Next, the wait. Two hours. Seriously?! Even if the food was good, is anything worth that kind of a wait?Last, the space. Narrow, crowded area with chairs all almost touching. It's very difficult to get into and out of your seat, the person next to and behind you needs to get up to let you out. There's nothing cool or hip about a small, crowded space inside a business building's lobby. No views. No impressive decor. Nothing.I give it one star because the service, despite all the other downfalls was polite and reasonably attentive."
4.5 star rating,"Amazing food, worth the wait, excellent service, and very warm atmosphere. Would recommend this to anyone!"
5 star rating,This is our favorite breakfast spot when we come to Detroit.  Fantastic food with wonderful service.  Never a disappointment.
5 star rating,Great Breakfast!  Good service.  Fast and wonderful Latte.  Industrial feel. Warm and friendly.  I highly recommended this stop.
5 star rating,"Came to Dime Store with the ladies last night. We've been trying to hit up this joint for a while and we were not disappointed!Ambiance: Relaxed, casual, between a diner and bistro - I quite liked the vibe in here. Service: Fantastic waiter last night, service was prompt. Since the three of us were sharing food, we asked for an extra poached egg on our benny - thank you to the chef and waiter for that! Also we were sitting around and chatting way past closing time - I really appreciated that we didn't feel rush and no one kicked us out even close to an hour after. Drinks/Beer: Small selection but something for everyone. We only had beers. My friend got the ginger beer which was pleasantly intense. I had the Ballast Point Watermelon IPA - delicious, highly recommend. Food: Delicious!! We got:- el toro rojo benny: This was very tasty! The chorizo was in patty form under the poached eggs. Very flavorful and tasty. I liked that the hollandaise was not super creamy. This definitely doesn't come across as an eggs Benedict to me but in a good way. - duck bop hash: this is a must-get. Definitely a different take on hash. I loved the pickled veggies and fixins on this one. The duck was a touch salty for my taste but I'm a low-sodium consumer usually. - seared brussel sprout salad: GET THIS. This was my most favorite thing we put in our mouths. I'm a huge fan of mushrooms in all things and the shiitake and oyster mushrooms in this salad were fantastic combined with thick cut pieces of bacon. It's served warm and is just so incredibly worth it. Parking: found street parking on a Thursday night right out front. The park detroit app is usable here which makes it easy to pay for parking.Definitely worth a visit if you're in downtown folks!"
5 star rating,"Three stars to me means nothing was wrong, but nothing blew me away either. I was definitely hyped up after hearing so may people talk positively about Dime Store, so that may be what some of the disappointment is attributed to. I must have missed something! I ordered an omelette and took bites of breakfast sandwiches and salads around the table. The pros: everything was very fresh, crisp, and plated well, mushrooms in my omelette were super flavorful and above average, and the rye bread was great. I also liked that the staff seemed very, very, very, VERY nice and caring in general. I would say I liked the atmosphere and getting to interact with the staff better than the food; they have that aspect down for sure. I wish I had more constructive criticism for the food...it wasn't bad, I just think that in a place like Detroit with so many options for brunch, the food needs to be atypically good. When I first read the menu, I was intrigued (cheesesteak benedict, duck reubens, spicy Korean fries) and texted my boyfriend a pic of the options that reminded me of him, so I will probably be back to give this place another try."
3 star rating,"Heard about Dime Store from a friend who suggested I go here for brunch while visiting Detroit and to say that I am pleased that I took this suggestion is an understatement.Arrived here around 2:20pm and although they close at 3:00pm the place was still jam packed. My manfriend and I like to have bar seating because it is always a more personal experience in my opinion. It was a 25 or so minute wait which was no problem at all considering they were about to close and still were willing to seat us. The hostesses were very apologetic and assuring that we would get seated soon which was way too kind of them.Once we got seated we were greeted immediately by our bartender/server (pretty sure his name was Antonio?) who made a magnificent bloody mary and was very attentive.  He was spot on about all suggestions (I had an omelette that was more fluffy than any omelette I have ever had in my entire life, not exaggerating!) and my manfriend had the special which was chicken jerk hash and he loved it.Since we were visiting from LA, enjoying some amazing food and a cocktail or two deep, we ended up chatting and befriending not only our bartender/server Antonio, but we also met a few other employees who were equally as welcoming. Even had the pleasure of meeting the owner, Larry who was super rad and very charming. Props to Larry for being so hospitable and shout out to Justin, Sid and Antonio again, as well. You guys are truly the foundation of a thriving and fantastic restaurant. I even left with a T-shirt that I am currently wearing as I type this. If and when in Detroit again would definitely be back to Dime Store."
5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing Sunday breakfast after Garth Brooks concert. Southwest chicken hash, strawberry stuffed French toast and Korean fries as an added bonus. Got to sit at the counter and watch the super talented cooks work their magic. Fun atmosphere. Great service. Delicious food. Get the Korean fries!!"
5 star rating,I love Dime. Wonderful brunch and service. Wish it was larger however just an all around great restaurant. We have limited options for brunch in Detroit and this is my top choice followed by Lady of the House and Parks and Rec. Parc's food is extremely average but location and service solid.
4 star rating,"I'm not sure why people keep opening these fancy hipster restaurants and making them tiny, but I digress. Fortunately, the food was good. The service was ""meh"", and definitely could be improved. Be prepared to wait way too long. I would come back during a weekday."
4 star rating,"It can be difficult to get in during normal times, but it's well worth the wait! I recently got take out from here and they made sure to package everything separately to avoid food getting soggy, which was definitely one of my big concerns. Going back soon!"
5 star rating,"Visiting Detroit from the other side of the state and we searched Yelp for the best breakfast place- THE DIME STORE. This place is awesome and the food is delicious! I ordered the special ""white walker French toast"" and it was literally the best french toast I've ever had. So unique! My fiancé ordered the Philly cheesecake Benny and oh my YUM! This place did not disappoint, and it's super fun inside. My only minor complaint is that our server brought our bill to us halfway through our meal without even asking if we needed/wanted anything else. Not a huge deal, but just not the best restaurant etiquette. Other than that, LOVED this place and will definitely come back the next time we're in Detroit."
4.5 star rating,"This place gives brunch a good name. We arrived to my Eater brunch pick of the weekend to find a massive crowd waiting in the spacious entryway. Luckily, our small party of two only had to wait about 5 minutes and we were promptly seated at the bar. The service was quick too. We ordered a veggie and philly hash. OmG. So good it was hard to eat mindfully and cherish every bite. The flavors and textures were perfectly balanced. Great food, service, music and vibes here."
5 star rating,"Went today for brunch with my boyfriend and we loved it! 20 min wait which wasn't bad at all. Service is efficient, food is tasty, and the inside is very cool and urban. I'm a huge fan of Asian fusion so I was excited to see some fusion dishes on the menu. I got the Duck Bop (duck confit hash) which was awesome. Boyfriend had the Korean bbq sandwich which he devoured in about 5 min .I hear great things about their eggs Benedict so we'll definitely be back!"
5 star rating,"So so good!  The place was packed but they still had time to be friendly and treat us nice. Once we got in the service was great and the food was even better. I wanted everything on the menu. Ended up with a smoked salmon dish and it was so great. My husband got a Reuben and it was pretty fabulous too. Even the fries were memorable. They also have a great selection of craft beers, some interesting cocktails and yummy coffee. This place is a MUST visit in Detroit!"
5 star rating,First off finding a breakfast spot open in downtown Detroit is difficult to find during the winter.  Thankfully this place was open and what a blessing it was.  We were sat down quickly even though the place was busy.  Neo greeted us with a nice smile and took our drink orders.  I noticed the special was the Cinnamon Almond French Toast which sounded amazing.  When I ordered it Neo gave me a huge smile and said that it was her favorite which made me really excited.  OMG.  It was absolutely fantastic.  When back in the Detroit area we will definitely be back!
5 star rating,Always Good...Once Able to OrderGreat place BUT it takes so long to get a table. They could expand and probably to just fine.  Food is Excellent!!!  Just have patience.  I would never go during lunch....that just wouldn't work!  I've saved my visits to weekends when we stay in Detroit.  Love it!
4 star rating,"Although the wait was an hour, it was worth it!! Hubby ordered the Duck Bop & I ordered the French Toast with strawberries. Both dishes were amazing. I also had a Peach Mimosa & it was great as well. Would highly recommend!!"
5 star rating,"Fun, yummy spot for brunch/lunch.  Way too long of a wait, but sometimes you just have to bite the bullet!  If you have the time, It's worth the wait, but plan for it and don't get worked up about it!  It's a small place and they know how to pack 'em in so be prepared for close quarters.  We enjoyed sitting at the back bar because it affords you a bird's eye view of the line cooks hard at work. Food is fabulous.  Service is super.  The Dime Store is worth every cent!"
4 star rating,"Our party of 6 was seated promptly during a midweek lunch around 1:30. We ordered Korean Bulgogi beef loaded fries, Korean Bulgogi beef salad, Duck Confit salad, chicken pesto sandwich with fries, and two orders of the Bacon and Avocado Omelet w/ breakfast fries and Rye toast. The food come out in a timely manner and were well-portioned in size. The servers were pleasant and tended to our needs without hovering unnecessarily. Also, the hostesses were very nice."
5 star rating,"Stopped by here for brunch while visiting Detroit for a wedding. Great service, really good food made from very high quality ingridients, and nice ambiance. This place is as good as any new American brunch spot you find in Williamsburg. Probably because we are from New York, but we also thought it is also really well priced. Definitely try the Duck Bop, which is sort of like bibimbop with shredded duck confit over French fires cut into little cubes. I would strongly recommend it if you happen to be passing by."
5 star rating,I am not a fan of breakfast food but the Duck Bop hash was absolutely amazing. I will never come back to Detroit and not stop by here.
4.5 star rating,"Overall, had great service and this was quite a lively brunch spot.  The duck hash was my fav, but the mimosas seemed a bit OJ-heavy and I did not feel great afterwards!  My fault, as we ordered a pitcher (we couldn't finish it anyways), but it did not feel like there was much champagne at all.  The Benedict was pretty good as well, but nothing crazy special.  I would recommend checking it out, but just a normal brunch to me."
3 star rating,"Tiny cute and busy, awesome atmosphere . Next time I'll order something more extravagant, I only had some slam dunk good French toast and a bowl of fresh fruit. The Mimosa was a bit off but the bar had plenty other great choices. Great brunch...I'd definitely go back again *Super attentive service! Loved that about this spot"
4 star rating,"Highly Recommend by a friend who had been here many years ago. cozy business inside another  building, look for signs. The staff is helpful, kind but rushed trying to get the patrons to seats and others out the door.  Busy place.The food was good and presented nicely.Nice place to try,"
4 star rating,"GO. Just go! This was another highly recommended brunch spot found on Yelp so we stopped by on a Sunday 30 minutes before they closed. This place is located on Griswold St, inside the lobby of the Chrysler House right by Lafayette and American Coney Island. You will have to park in a nearby parking structure and walk more than likely. This is hands down my favorite brunch spot thus far! We arrived at 2:30pm and we walked up to the host stand and was told there was a a 20-25 minute wait for a table but two. Immediately after she finished the sentence, we were seated...fastest 25 minutes ever! One downside..this place is small and tight. By the size, I would assume that this was supposed to be a place where the people that work in the Chrysler House building could hang out and eat but it grew into something big. I can imagine that during peak hours, the wait is close to an hour. Another downside, they close at 4pm on Monday-Friday and 3pm on Saturday and Sunday. I highly recommend coming after 1pm on weekends to avoid really big crowds. We ordered a pitcher of mimosas, I ordered the homemade turkey sausage sandwich and my fiancé ordered the steak and cheese and truffle fries. Everything was phenomenal and reasonably priced. Our server was sweet and attentive. Dime Store is at the top of our list of brunch spots and we can't wait to come back!"
5 star rating,"While visiting Detroit for the auto show I searched for the best breakfast/brunch place and I think I was lucky from the very first attempt. The Dime Store came on top of the list and without any doubt we headed to the restaurant to enjoy some food. There's a bit of onstreet parking in front of the restaurant (I wouldn't count on it) and a few lots right across the street. The waiting time on the weekend might be up to 30 mins depending on the party size and preference of bar/table but it's worth it regardless! We were actually seated pretty quickly at the bar. The menu has all sorts of things but their hashes stand out and I recommend ordering one of them (look on the right side of the menu for a special hash!) Our food arrived quickly and everything was perfectly delicious. We had the sweetest server and our bill came out to be very reasonable. I'd totally recommend this spot for dining out for families, couples, and singles any day of the week!"
5 star rating,"Ok so I know this place is supposed to be all the rage but we just thought it was ok. I was here a few weeks ago with a friend. We waited a bit over an hour for brunch and the lobby was packed. So they give you a number when you arrive and are flexible on you leaving the building as long as you tell them. Ok so we decide to go kill time for a bit and let them know. When we return they gave us a different number. Well this system doesn't work as they called the first number and not the second. If my friend had not remembered our original number we would have missed our reservation. Just let people keep the same number, since the staff does not communicate well and it's just not a good idea to begin with. So we finally get seated at a table that really shouldn't be there. It is a space between all the bench areas. It was not comfortable being backed right up to the people behind me and struggling to get in and out. I am sure the servers would also appreciate a little space to move. A couple was seated next to us after we ordered. Somehow they got their food and were almost done before we got our food, and then they blamed it on my friend ordering her burger well done. huh?? They don't take that long to cook. Not sure what really happened but the food came as soon as we asked for an update. So overall just ok. Our waitress was very nice. Atmosphere is cramped and loud. Coffee was fine, OJ is from a carton and not fresh, fyi. The burger, fries, and cheesesteak benedict were good. It is nice that salad is a side option without extra charge. The home fries are not good, very small squares of potato that were overcooked, not sure who thought that was a good idea. Even if the food were amazing, the atmosphere is uncomfortable and the wait too long for an average experience. We didn't get the hype and my friend said she liked The Hudson Café better. There are too many brunch places in Detroit to return."
3 star rating,"On a business trip so it's was worth getting up early to escape the breakfast included hotel offering.  Cheesesteak Benny was nice unique take on the Benny.  Biscuit was a sweet upgrade on the English muffin.  American cheese sly attention. Get a side of the local pork sausage patties.  Why are you still reading, you should be ordering!"
5 star rating,I love the Dime Store! I go there at least once a week. They have awesome breakfast/brunch or lunch options. I work in Detroit and they are next door to me. Awesome service and friendly staff!
4 star rating,"My husband and I love this place. Usually we get one savory dish and one sweet, but at Dime Store my cheesesteak Benny is all mine. We've always had friendly service and food has always been delicious. Chai lattes are good too."
5 star rating,Always Good...Once Able to OrderGreat place BUT it takes so long to get a table. They could expand and probably to just fine.  Food is Excellent!!!  Just have patience.  I would never go during lunch....that just wouldn't work!  I've saved my visits to weekends when we stay in Detroit.  Love it!
4.5 star rating,"The duck bop hash was divine! No other way to describe it, other than the fact that I'm still dreaming about it months later. Duck confit served with potato hash fried to perfection with oh so heavenly korean bbq glaze with an egg on top. A unique combination for sure, and executed so well your tastebuds are left in awe because you haven't tasted genius like this before.Extra points: Usually with these brunch dishes the toast sits on the side as plate filler, but their English muffin was served with some of the best not-from-a-jar blueberry jam that just as well stole the show. We also happened to arrive during their weekday happy hour! From 3-6pm Tuesday through Friday drinks start at 50% off to 40 and 30 percent every hour. Since it was brunch, ordered an Irish coffee that came in a trendy Dime Store mug and warmed my soul. It's no exaggeration to say I fell in love that morning - with a highly inventive brunch menu and trendy hipster vibe to top it off.A MUST EAT HERE. Going back as soon as I can."
5 star rating,"Took a nice walk in downtown Detroit and stumbled across this place. I got there maybe 30 minutes after they opening and the placed was already full. Sat at the bar top watching the cooks do their thing. French toast with fresh fruit, side of bacon and a hot coffee. Pair that with good service and I was very content. Well done."
4 star rating,"Easily one of my favorite brunch spots in the city. I have never been disappointed by any of the dishes I've tried. The eggs Benedict, French toast, veggie hash and tomato avocado breakfast sandwiches are all outstanding choices, but my favorite has to be an item that appears sporadically on the specials menu. It's their waffle with cheesecake on top along with fresh fruit and it is FANTASTIC. I hope they decide to add it to the regular menu at some point. They serve Zingerman's coffee which is great quality, the ingredients they use are all very fresh and I've never had a bad experience. The only issue is if you show up any later than 10 on weekend (especially in summer) you can expect a wait anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and a half. I normally am opposed to waiting more than a half an hour for a meal, but for Dime Store I'm always willing to wait."
5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I walked here after staying the night downtown at the Double Tree a couple of weekends ago. I ordered the sweet potato black bean chili with kale and the sweet poached pear salad. It was a great size and I only ate half of it for lunch and ate the other half for dinner! I really enjoyed it. He had the thanksgiving eggs benedict which he said was the best meal he had ever had for brunch downtown. It was on special. I'll definitely be back again. This was my second experience here and both were great. Last time I had had breakfast, so this time I got lunch. Check it out! Be prepared for a little wait, but there are places to sit in the lobby and wait and they move quickly."
5 star rating,"Man, maybe they were just having a bad day but our food was not good. This was our first time there, we're big time foodies and brunch people. Our food was cold and just overall not good. I ordered the veggie hash with avocado, the potatoes were cold and unflavored and the eggs just okay. The English muffin tasted like it was toasted an hour prior. My partner ordered the sausage omelet with avocado and bacon on the side, he said the same thing, subpar. My brother had the smoked salmon Benny And it was by far the only good thing at our table. My moms friend toast was okay, my sisters omelet was also just okay. Overall, not sure what time hype is about."
3 star rating,"I brought a group of 14 for a late lunch/early dinner (abt 4:30pm).  It was FANTASTIC.Everyone LOVED their food (see other reviews for specifics on interior and food, it's pretty well covered.)  They especially loved the time that the owner took with us - talking and telling his history, as well as the restaurants history.  The time was perfect to catch a meal, with a group, without waiting.  I think they stay open late enough to go before a Wings/Tigers/evening Lions game, which I would HIGHLY recommend, as lunch is crazy busy."
5 star rating,"I went to Dime Store with my mom, sister, aunt and 6 year old daughter. It was really, really busy for a Friday but we got seated right away. I ordered the sausage hash and it was good. Although I found the potatoes to be cut a little too small for what I think a hash should be. The were kind of hard to get onto your fork.My sister and mom had the Mexican burrito which was a special. They both liked it but didn't think it was something out of this world. Overall this place was solid, but the way people rave about it, I was expecting something out of this world. The service was ok and a little rushed. They weren't unfriendly, but there was a little something lacking. However, I would go back again and give it another try."
3 star rating,"Went here as couldn't escape the hype, and was somewhat impressed.Luckily didn't have to wait at all for a party of two for breakfast, although the place was very busy. It's pretty tight seating, not exactly intimate but what can you expect for a busy downtown place.One thing I'd suggest is to change the chairs! They make an awful screech when moved over the cement floor!Both of us ordered benedicts, myself the philly cheesesteak benny, my friend El Toro Rojo.We both substituted breakfast potatoes for salad.My benedict was absolutely delcious! Loved the steak and grilled onions, mixed with the hollandaise and egg nicely.The Rojo looked and smelled good too!I would suggest better breakfast potatoes/homefries. The ones we were served were not like the hash ones, they were the tiny ones you'd get from a freezer bag.Main reason for 3 stars, although I'd give the place another shot for lunch dinner, but definitely wouldn't wait 45-hour for it!"
3 star rating,"I had a lot of Brunches around the Dime Store and I can tell you first hand, its over rated. I have their Veggie Hash with 2 sunny side eegs and also the Banana Foster French Toast.Hash was something like I easily could of cooked myself. Very small potato bites but the balance defintley was there , no doubt. The portion size was smaller than I thought it would be as well.The Banana Foster French Toast.... Nothing special. Nothing really came out to me differently like eating at a Coney Island. I was expecting different flavors with the real Banana Foster taste, it was more like Normal French Toast with some Bananas. They could of Caramelized the Bananas and that would of been different but just plain bananas?? ehhhh I had a lot better before."
2 star rating,"Excellent. Duck reuben is a must. Slow on one cocktail, otherwise quick service. Party of six seated in ~20min at lunch time."
4.5 star rating,"We spent a weekend in downtown Detroit and chose the Dime Store for our breakfast spot.  It is a quaint, fun little restaurant inside the Chrysler House building. The coffee is from Zingermans.  We had the bacon avocado omelette, the spicy belly benny (the jalapeño pesto is excellent on the benny), and house fries -which if you love truffle, were excellent. The only minor complaint, is the mimosa was heavy on the OJ. We can't wait to go back!"
5 star rating,"I've had a ""draft"" of a review sitting on here for over two years. I never fully know what to say about Dime Store and keep thinking nothing I could say would ever compare to my experiences there. This is the best brunch spot I've ever been to. Hands down. I will fight you about this. You will lose. The entire team at Dime Store is phenomenal. They will give you the inside scoop on Detroit, they'll help you find the shuttle to the game, they'll give you tips on dinner spots and dive bars -- they treat you like a good friend the second you walk in the door. I'm a regular at Dime Store and know quite a few people by name, I've never had less than VIP treatment and always rave about this place. I once had two friends in town from Indiana and when we sat down at the bar at Dime Store they were completely blown away, I mentioned to the bartender that I wanted to show them the best brunch in the city and all of a sudden a few apps we didn't ordered were presented in front of us. We were treated like royalty, and not because they wanted return visits later (I was already a regular and my friends are from too far away for Dime to get much of a return on investment from the complimentary apps we received) they simply wanted my friends to have a great experience and they did.Pro-tip: Ask for the non-alcoholic old fashioned. Made with nitro cold-brew and orange and chocolate bitters PHENOMENAL."
5 star rating,"The hype is real! This place is delicious and worth the wait. Had a breakfast sandwich and waffles for the table and all were great. Especially the turkey sausage sandwich- one of the best I've ever had. Plus the server was SO nice, I wish I had her name to complement her. Great food and great service = five stars! I'll be back."
5 star rating,"Dime Store consistently delivers interesting and delicious food. From traditional scrambled eggs and toast to variations of eggs Benedict, it brings diner cuisine to a gourmet level. Today's breakfast included eggnog French toast and pork belly jalapeño eggs Benedict. The French toast came with a ruminfused sauce and the spice was bold in the eggs Benedict."
5 star rating,"Dime Store... I need my five cents back.  People say this place is great.  My experience is the service is good, but like many places in the metro area... the food is just okay.  Not bad... not saying that at all.  I just don't think, the food here... you have to try ...  Maybe if it wasn't so hyped bore I went, I would give it a higher score.  So I went a few more times.  Service is good.  The wait is long (very small place).  The food... decent.  So I still don't get the hype.

3 star rating,Have only been once for breakfast. Good portions and great service.  Will have to go back to post a better review.
5 star rating,"Pretty long wait on a Saturday - about an hour.  Quality of the food was decent, but they forgot to bring out certain sides until well into our meal. Everyone's toast and English muffin was overtoasted and hard as a rock.  Prices were fair and coffee was good and strong.  Not really sure why half the menu items need bulgogi in them??"
3 star rating,Excellent food and service. I had steak eggs Benedict.  Was excellent. Portions were good sized. prices are fair.
4 star rating,"Hit this place for brunch on a Saturday for my birthday.  Had almost an hour wait, and my whole party of 6 couldn't even sit together.Food was good, but good enough for that wait, still unsure."
4 star rating,"Sad you can't make reservations online, Yelp, etc. but this place is definitely worth the wait and hype. If I'm ever back in Detroit, I'm for sure making a stop here!  Shared everything with the spouse and we couldn't decide what to eat because everything in the pictures on Yelp looked so good!  Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs but it was sooo worth it!"
4.5 star rating,This place is awesome !!! The food is great! I tried duck bop and I enjoyed it! It's so delicious!!! I highly recommend this dish! The service is great too!
5 star rating,The Dime Store was the best brunch I've had in a long time. The biscuits were incredible as well as the French toast. The service was great and it is pocket friendly
5 star rating,"I can't say enough good things about Dime Store. Yes, you may have to wait to get a table but it is totally worth it. The peach mimosas are out of this world and the coffee is really good too. They always have different and interesting things on the menu which I always try... And even though they sound strange sometimes I have never been disappointed. The breakfast burrito was hands down the best one I've ever eaten. I've also sat at the counter and had some really cool conversations with the workers up at the counter area. Great atmosphere, great wait staff, and delicious food... What more can you ask for?"
5 star rating,"A brunch place with something extra special is not so easy to find. Their food have an extra kick, an unexpected twist to it, differentiating themselves from ordinary boring brunch menuFood: Duck bob - Diced potatoes covered with confit-duck leg. It's crispy, savory and also pleasantly sweet. Cauliflower soup - very rich and creamy. It's deliciously healthy. Location: located in the heart of downtown Detroit, parking could be tricky."
4 star rating,"Wow! This breakfast lunch spot is the bomb. We got the duck Reuben and the Philly cheesesteak Benedict. Both of them were out standing, they have a list on the back of the menu saying where the the local ingredients are from.  Both entrees were so tasty we will be back to try more of the menu!!"
5 star rating,"Great brunch! Little wait, but didn't mind because the lobby of the Chrysler House is beautiful. We ate at the bar and had great service. The bartender spoke very passionately about Detroit and all the Dime Store offerings!"
5 star rating,"Food was great. I am only commenting on the service.I was meeting a friend who was running late. I asked to get a table, but stated up front I would be waiting for my second person to join. Immediately I was told I could not be seated. So I waited 5 min then offered to buy a cocktail. The host said ""You would still be waiting for someone but I will seat you"".I got seated at the bar, immediately told the bartender I was waiting and he said no worries. I ordered a drink and waited. 10 min in of waiting I ordered a cup of soup and the bartender gave a smirky laugh. Like I wasn't going to order more. That bothered me. It wasn't my fault my friend was late.  She arrived, ordered...we ate and chatted. Once our plates were removed the bartender stood and stared at us, to the point where she mentioned it. I was ignoring it. I felt highly uncomfortable the entire time I was in this restaurant. There was no one waiting so I don't know why this guy was staring, trying to get us out of our seats. His final comment was the best...""thanks ladies for spending your afternoon with us"". I have never been more on edge in a restaurant before in my life. It's a shame seeing as the food is really good. I tipped the standard 20% because I was once in the restaurant business, and would have tipped more since we stayed longer than an hour...but after that, I didn't. I didn't even get a refill on my water."
2 star rating,"Sugar donut? Give me two! The Dime Store came highly recommended by the concierge and a couple of bartenders in the morning as we were leaving the Detroit Foundation Hotel. So we all decided to walk to brunch and wait in line. Turns out the line was FOREVER long, and we placed our 11 to go orders and hung out until they were ready. We walked to the waterfront, went to town on brunch, and went about our day.I ordered the duck bop, and was super excited about it. Who can say no to a house duck confit leg, spinach, onion, bulgogi, pickled veggies, and sriracha? Unfortunately it was extremely too sweet for my liking, and I wasn't a huge fan. I did enjoy the potatoes, but they weren't savory enough to contrast the meal. I wish they would have pan tossed them in sriracha. That would have sealed the deal on the sweet and savory. I did however, also really like the marmalade the dish came with. I scooped up everything in that little container with a couple bites of bread and made that ""dessert"".I'm not sure that I'd come back here if I was in town again, except for 500 of those sugar donuts."
3 star rating,"This place is one of the most consistent breakfast/brunch spots we've love to dine at on a regular basis. This small yet quaint space features bar and table seating. Prepare to get cozy with your stranger neighbors. If your looking for privacy this isn't place for your next business meeting, unless the subject isn't confidential. I also would not recommend this venue for large parties. The food here is always creative and innovative with specials added to the menu that change daily and weekly. There's also no need to dress up for this laid back atmosphere. THE FOOD: Is the main attraction from the variations of French toast to Egg Benedict. All items are cooked to order and served hot! They also serve lunch and the portions are filling. Try not to over order. Cappuccino here is one of my favorites as well. THE STAFF: Are pretty efficient when it comes to service and knowledge of product. There's typically a long wait to be seated on weekends but it's definitely worth the wait. I've never encountered a horrible server, just a forgetful one. But I will say they are accommodating if something isn't right."
4 star rating,"Service: 5 starsIn town for a few days and found this place on yelp. The wait was pretty long but I had time to waste as I was waiting for my airbnb to be ready. I sat at the bar and five stars for the wonderful service (host, server, bartender). Everyone was very friendly and attentive. Food: 3 starsI expected the food to be on a different level because of the outstanding reviews. Korean Fries. Maybe it's because I've had so much Korean food in my life but the Korean fries were underwhelming. Tasted like what it says. Fries, bulgogi, aioli sauce and pickled vegetables. Nothing special - I felt like it didn't blend together. ""Spicy"" Pork Belly Benedict .  The server highly recommended this. I couldn't tell that any part of this dish was spicy....but maybe my taste buds are numb from all the spicy food I've had in the past. The pork belly was super dry/fried. I was definitely expecting something juicier.  It was also pretty disappointing that the egg yolk was firm and didn't run at all. At least the hollandaise sauce was good...That being said, the french toast looked pretty tasty...wish I got that."
4.5 star rating,"This place is busy, so be prepared to wait a bit for a table. We went around 10:00ish and had a 10 minute wait. Totally worth it! The cold nitro brew was on point and even their black coffee was good. The presentation and more importantly the taste of the food was all there. I will say their homemade sausage may be a bit much for some people with the seasoning. Definitely would go back."
5 star rating,"Loved the brunch here. I went on a weekday and sat right at the bar. Really good service,  very yummy food and drinks!"
5 star rating,"I really enjoy this place. The food is good and I like the ambiance. Warning, they can get very crowded. I tried to go here at lunch twice during the work week, but had to leave when I was told about the length of the wait. It seems like getting in without waiting is the luck of the draw.  But once you get through the wait, the food is delicious. I love the korean bbq sandwich with the exception of the hoagie on which it is served. I think they need to toast the hoagie or get a toasted baguette for the sandwich. However, regardless of the bread, the flavors are spot on. This sandwich tastes like a beef banh mi.  Also, with similar flavors, the spicy korean flavors are delicious, and the full order is HUGE.  I am not a fan of their brussel sprouts, but otherwise everything else I have had here has been tasty. Also a bonus, they provide validated parking in a lot that is attached."
5 star rating,"Being from Florida, I had no idea what to expect except to believe EVERY positive review about this place and let me say - they are all SOOOO accurate.  I ordered the cheesesteaks bene, fruit and Mac and cheese with bacon... I am one happy camper!  If I am ever back in Detroit, I will be coming here everyday."
5 star rating,"We Recently visited the wonderful state of Michigan and historic downtown Detroit. We ate at several places but for breakfast this was my favorite. I actually said yum out loud while eating here. We ordered way too much food because everything looked so good. Our waitress was delightful, when I left I felt like hugging her rather than just saying goodbye. Here's a few pics of our feast. Grits, Benedict, Bloody Mary, sausage hash and I didn't post the carnitas breakfast nachos."
5 star rating,"I could eat here everyday of my life. Good food, well plated, well priced, good variety, good service, specials are good and keep the menu fresh, new school Detroit hustles harder type decor. Literally zero complaints. This place is amazing."
5 star rating,One of the best breakfast/brunch joints in downtown Detroit. The food is great and the vibe is right.May be a wait though.  Especially on the weekend. The staff is great for the most part. You might get a suburbanite hipster kid trying to be too cool once in a while but they are a part of the game.
5 star rating,"Wonderful breakfast place!! Visited on a weekend about a month ago with a friend while vistingthe area. I ordered the yogurt, breakfast potatoes, and a coffee. Service was great, prompt, and friendly. We really wanted to go one moretime but had to leave town. I only wish the place was a little bit bigger. Will definitley go again if I am ever in that area."
4 star rating,"I love this place. My favorite breakfast place in downtown Detroit, so far. I've been here and to Parks & Rec, which was great also, but am giving the edge to Dime Store."
5 star rating,"Went here for brunch. Crazyyy long wait to get in the door. Thank god there is a lobby area to wait in with couches and chairs. We even had time to wander and find Bon Bon Bon ( which was awesome, but not what we were there for). When we finally got seated we were squished into the bar seating. Service was ok for how busy it was. I had the turkey sausage breakfast sandwich and fruit bowl. It was good. But nothing l'd rave about. My sister and mom got the duck bop hash and they were the opposite of impressed. I tried some of the potatoes and they were very dry. I just don't understand the hype. It's decent food but not worth the wait"
4.5 star rating,Wasn't a fan of Benny's but bc of dime store I'm hooked.. awesome spot in the financial district!
5 star rating,"5 stars all around! This place was crazy good. The only downside about it would be the long, long, long wait, BUT that only means that people know the food is good and are willing to wait for it. Can't complain about that, and having to wait awhile isn't something I can knock stars off for. We were a group of 4 and when we put our name in they told us about an hour. It wasn't that big of a deal because there was a galley right down the street with a full bar so we posted up there and had a bloody mary while we waited. After a little over an hour we returned and were seated pretty quickly. The place is very small and quarters are close. Otherwise it's a really unique little place inside with big windows that let in plenty of natural light and provides a view of the city as you eat. We ordered the pork rinds to start. Not many places have pork rinds on the menu and typically, I think of them as a gas station snack (yuck), but these were REALLY GOOD. Sriracha and honey were drizzled on top. Suer tasty. I built my own omelette and after a few bites I literally said out loud to everyone at my table, ""this is the best omelette I've ever had"" and my mom chimed in and said the same thing! I mean i've had a million omelettes before but this was one creamy and perfect. It came with breakfast potatoes and I picked the english muffin as my bread side. Besides the omelette being A+ the jam that came on the english muffin was homemade and out of this world. Seriously. We ordered a pitcher of bloody marys as well for the table- nothing special and not loaded up with any goodies, but that didn't even matter. THE FOOD WAS SO GOOD. Service was great and our server was on top of everything. If I ever find myself in Detroit again, I will 100% wait to eat here again. Yum!"
5 star rating,One of the best breakfast spots i've found in a long time. I've been dying to try this place and due to their limited hours i could never go . But when i finally did OMG it was amazing. the wait was slightly long but it was worth the wait . food was amazing! the service was good. servers were very attentive but not overbearing. Breakfast and alcohol you can't go wrong .
5 star rating,Had the perfect breakfast here on a Friday. It was super cute ambiance that's very casual but the windows and wall art gives it a special vibe. The veggie hash was one of the most appealing vegetarian breakfasts I've seen in a while. This is the perfect spot for a casual breakfast or brunch when you want the food to be yummy and filling but not crazy heavy and oily.
5 star rating,"Worth the wait and the drive from the burbs! The food was solid, was creative and was perfect blend of flavors. I had be Coney Dog Eggs Benny, my husband had the Duck Bop. The food was fantastic but I was more impressed by the staff. From the hostess to the food runner and our server, everyone was kind professional and looked they worked well as a team. People were hustling to put people in their seats, the sever was genuine when is came to recommendations. Then restaurant was decorated modern hipster and was welcoming. Loved it! We will be back often!"
5 star rating,"Stopped by breakfast last weekend on a visit to Detroit. We were looking for a brunch spot on Saturday morning and this was the closest option.We had a wait of about 20 minutes and were then seated at the bar area. The menu is fairly diverse with both breakfast and lunch options. We opted for an omelette and French toast. Both were absolutely incredible. Omelette was thick yet fluffy, filled with any toppings you desire. The French toast was amazing. Nothing complicated at all, very simple, but the flavors and spices were unlike any French toast I've tasted. Overall, I'd highly recommend Dime Store to anyone looking for a top tier brunch spot downtown."
5 star rating,"Hold on. Stop the presses. The duck bop is the best thing smoking. Omg it os delicious. I usually go to lafayette coney island but parked around the corner and walked past this place amd decided to investigate and I am so happy I did. Lafayette is taking a back seat, but I'm taking some chili dogs home. Lol."
5 star rating,"Fantastic breakfast or lunch spot. All of the menu items are available all day. So you can do a burger for breakfast or a waffle for dinner. I opted for a mimosa to drink and it was absolutely delicious. My mom, whom is not a drinker even managed to down the whole thing in no time. I had the cauliflower soup, which is served in a mug, and it was velvety and divine. Has crunchy fried onion on top. My mom had the pork belly eggs Benedict. More than decent sizes of the pork and eggs were poached beautifully. My favorite thing I ordered was the bacon parm truffle fries. They came with a flavored mayo dipping sauce that was equally delicious. The service was excellent. Our server, Ann Marie, took the time to tell us about the menu and all of the popular items. She also made sure we had a great experience...and we did. I will definitely be back for more of those fries!!'"
5 star rating,"Did not even get a chance to go in, on Sunday wait was 45 minutes but after an hour we decided to leave but the host was super friendly"
2 star rating,"This place was a disappointment for me. I found the prices high and the food a bit bland. I ordered sides of potatoes, yogurt and turkey sausage in attempt to form a healthier meal. I forgot to specify no honey on the yogurt. Btw sweetener on Greek yogurt with fresh fruit is so unnecessary. The sausage had some kind of sweetened sauce on it and the potatoes were beyond basic. I'd rather had gone to a classic dinner instead."
4.5 star rating,"Great choice for a Sunday afternoon! We arrived about 45 minutes before they were scheduled to close and had to wait 30-35 minutes for a table which was no problem nor did they act like they didn't want you to be seated because they were closing. We had the cheesesteak eggs Benedict and the cheesesteak sandwich, my husband doesn't care for eggs Benedict. Both were very good. The Benedict came with a small side of mixed greens which was very fresh and had a light vinaigrette dressing on it. I also had a mimosa which was very good while my friend had a Bloody Mary which she enjoyed as you can see in the pictures it's already empty. This is one of my favorite places in the city when you are able to get seated without a crazy long wait. Just wish it was a little bigger to accommodate all that want to come here!"
5 star rating,"Great breakfast! We had a pretty quick wait in the spacious lobby area. Great latte and delicious Korean Fries as an ""appetizer."" I tried the cheesesteak Benedict and my date had the sausage hash with a biscuit instead of an English muffin. The biscuit was soooo delicious. Everything else was too but the fries, latte, and biscuit were the highlights!"
5 star rating,"While the wait is usually long, the food is extremely tasty and service is quick and efficient. This is a good place for brunch for a always delicious menu, but in my opinion, it does not allow for the most laid back or leisurely experience. If you're looking for a multi-hour drawn out brunch with many cups of coffee with a friend you have lots to catch up on, I would go here first for the food and then have another less busy restaurant or park lined up for afterwards."
4 star rating,"Amazing food! Amazing staff! So friendly and kind ! Went there with my dumb ass ex and he complained about the food because bland but I tasted it and it was fine.. he just liked his food even more salty I guess. I told him could just pour more salt on the eggs so he did.  I forgot to take home my order of Mac and cheese (so good.) and I called up and asked to come back and I had my receipt,.. and i was taken care of!"
5 star rating,"I've heard a lot of great things about this place but I'm rarely in the area early enough for breakfast/brunch. My friend was visiting from out of state and I thought it'd be a good opportunity to try it out.The place was packed but our wait was maybe 5min, tops. Service was great and the waiter was able to point out the most popular items, and give personal opinion. They also offer parking validation for the first few hours if you use the lot around the corner.Food was very good and the portions are generous."
5 star rating,Had breakfast there this morning. Great menu and friendly staff. Small but cozy - like the vibe. Highly recommend.
5 star rating,"Great place! We had breakfast there, bacon/avocado omelet. Wonderful Bloody Mary. We sat at the bar, our bartender was very friendly, and attentive."
5 star rating,I am not a fan of breakfast food but the Duck Bop hash was absolutely amazing. I will never come back to Detroit and not stop by here.
5 star rating,Amazing brunch place! Good size place and busy but wait safe is on their game. Whether you are grabbing a quick coffee or getting grub You will not be disappointed!
5 star rating,This place is incredible! Amazing salad sandwiches and fries. We were in town for a conference- came back two says in a row. Couldn't resist. Excellent food!
4.5 star rating,"I liked everything about this place except for the portions, not that they didn't give you enough .... I just wanted more ."
4 star rating,"Pretty long wait, but this place has the best breakfast I've had in my life!- Worth the wait.- Worth every penny.- You will leave satisfied and ready to get on with your day.Found this place on Yelp and I was not disappointed. I have recommended this place to everyone I know, even our pilot! I don't like to go to places that are too hyped up, but this place is worth every minute of the wait. I would recommend serving mimosas, tea, and coffee while people wait because we did get a little anxious while waiting. But once again, it was worth the wait in the end."
5 star rating,"Perfect historic location, good service and really good food! Perfect place to hash it up with fam ! Thanks to the staff to hosting the totally obnoxious Warmack Perry Edwards Banks & Barron family! #Detroitisbackonthemap"
5 star rating,"We were looking for a brunch/bloody Mary place to eat before Lions game, and Dime store had great reviews. Had some issues getting there because of the marathon but that was our fault for not doing homework. Waited a bit longer than the projected wait due to people watching the race after they were done eating. However the service and pace of delivery of drinks and food were super fast. Drinks were great and food very delicious with great presentation. We ordered a hash and an omelette. Both delicious. Only wish I had room for more food after the guy next to us ordered the pork belly Bennie. Getting that the next time we go. With the ""to go"" coffee bar in front you could get coffee to drink while waiting. Smallish place. Wish they had a little extra room to have a ""drink "" while waiting for table as you can't take alcohol out into building lobby where people wait. Not a huge deal. Just would be nice."
5 star rating,You HAVE TO try their lox Benedict! Definitely the best I've ever had!My husband and I can't wait to come back here on our yearly visit to Detroit!
5 star rating,"As expected from the photos, the food was pretty good. I had the Salmon Eggs Benedict (2) with a side of potatoes. The potatoes were a bit dry and over seasoned, but I still got through them. Overall the meal was fine. My issue was with the restaurant was how much I was rushed to finish my meal from the minute it was placed on the table. I get that popular brunch restaurants with people waiting in line have to move tables efficiently, but that shouldn't be at the risk of the customer's experience.I took a couple bites of my salmon and waved to the server to re-fill my water and coffee that had been empty for nearly 10 minutes. Instead of acknowledging my drinks she asked if I wanted a to-go box. I had literally just got the food a couple minutes earlier. Then as I was finishing up the first Eggs Benny, she placed the check book on my table. There were other things that happened but you get my point. I was alone so its not like I was hogging the table for hours while talking to friends.Regardless, if you're hungry and in a rush, definitely come here for a good meal. But don't come here if you want to actually savor the food in a chill restaurant environment."
3 star rating,"Great friendly atmosphere, fair prices, nice staff and good eats.  Great morning here.  Oh, and coffee is delicious.  Had the Spicy Benny.  Fantastic."
5 star rating,"Cool and hip small trendy diner vibe. Good service and a great location. Interesting and eclectic menu and the food is good enough to come back. It's small enough that the tables are very close together and that was a little annoying. They seem to have struck a cord with several variations of eggs Benedict that the hipsters seem to insist on calling ""bennies"" as though they just got the inside scoop on some gourmet novelty that hasn't been around for eons. And that, pretty much, describes the place and its clientele. Fun times."
4 star rating,"Food was great! We had to wait 50 minutes, but it went by quickly and they have a big lobby area to wait in and people watch. Also were able to order coffee and hot chocolate while we waited. The hot chocolate was delicious! Not some powder crap. I got the housemade sausage hash and fiance got the bacon avocado omelette. Both were delicious, however I wasn't blown away. Not sure I would go again based on the wait:deliciousness ratio. But the food was definitely scrumptious!"
4 star rating,"Awesome! Came here for brunch with a friend before a Tiger's game and it was great! We arrived at about 2:15 on a Saturday, and they were jam packed. The hostess estimated about a 35 minute wait - it felt much shorter but we weren't paying attention for sure. We sat at the bar and had such amazing service from the bartender. He was very friendly, easy to talk to, and had us laughing. My friend got biscuits & gravy, I got one of the specials (BBQ chicken & biscuit), and we split an order of Korean fries. Everything was amazing! The Korean fries were perfectly balanced with tasty beef & a spicy kick. Their biscuits are amazing - flaky and buttery. I cannot wait to go back & try some of their other offerings!!"
4.5 star rating,Stopped in on a Sunday morning and was stunned by the wait. This is clearly a brunch hot spot. We'll have to try again. In the meantime we placed a to-go order and used the generous seating accommodations in the lobby of this beautiful classic building.My brother-in-law originally brought us to showcase the pork rinds he'd discovered. I'm not much of a fan but I'll say for pork rinds they were pretty good. The real star was the Spicy Korean Fries. Those alone were worth the four block walk and twenty minute wait. The beef and spices were a bright spot on our hungover palettes and the fat content was just right. Looking forward to our next visit.
4 star rating,"I give this restaurant 5 stars because it the best breakfast place in Downtown Detroit. The Fly Trap in Ferndale is the best breakfast in Metro Detroit. Atmosphere is cool and the restaurant is located in the bustling Campus Martius area. Decor is nice and the staff is friendly. The food is delicious and not as ""precious"" as at Parks and Rec. I like Parks and Rec, but I like a real hearty breakfast and this place offers that in Spades!!! Coffee is great too. If you're in Downtown Detroit, and you want breakfast, this should be your first choice."
5 star rating,"We went to Dime Store on a Friday morning and the place was packed. We were the last of the party to arrive. NOTE: you won't be seated until your whole party arrives. The turnover was brisk without people feeling like they were feeling rushed.The restaurant is wheelchair and mobility scooter accessible. More importantly, all of the staff are considerate and not doting to ensure the seating accommodates your needs. We started off with caffeine. The hubster and my brother opted for nitrogen brewed, it was strong! Not my thing, but they dug it, reminds me of if Guinness were a coffee. I had a perfect latte.Next we went for some starters. Brussels Sprouts had a nice char, the sauce on the pork rinds had amazing depth and the bacon/parm French fries were just overall full of sin.On to the main event. I had the special, churrasco steak with a tomatillo sauced hash. One thing I have to call out - our waiter had the kitchen pre-slice my steak. I have to pull up to a table and eat sort of sideways from my scoot, it would have been impossible for me to cut the steak myself. That level of consideration made my day. Plus, my eggs were poached to perfection, possibly the best i have ever had.Other dishes at our table consisted of: French toast, sausage hash, sausage omelette and another special (forgot what that was). Everything was spectacular. I appreciate that the food was not salty. Too many restaurants over salt as their seasoning, instead the depth of our food came from well orchestrated spices.Dime Store is a new fave for us, can't wait to go back!"
5 star rating,"This was stupid good. As others said, the place is tiny (so you're seated close together) and there is often a wait, but we were so pleasantly surprised by this place! We were staying at a downtown hotel, so we walked here (very convenient). I ordered the Cheesesteak Benny and my husband had the General Tso's Benny - YUM! We also split a half order of the fries, which were divine. I'd totally come back here again if I'm in downtown Detroit around brunch!"
5 star rating,"The wait is very long - my friend and I arrived two hours before closing and we had to wait for 1.5 hours before being seated. The restaurant is tucked away in a big building that houses several other businesses, but you should be able to see the restaurant sign from the street as well.Tables are a little claustrophobically-placed. They seem to specialize in Korean-flavored food in non-Korean food like French fries and eggs. It is delicious, but Korean flavored American food aren't really my thing. They do have a parking garage with validated parking."
4 star rating,Really a gem.  This is my go-to breakfast in downtown Detroit.
5 star rating,"Yelp reviews led us to this lovely new restaurant when we were in town for the Detroit Jazz Festival.  Great coffee to start - love that they serve Zingerman's roast. The menu isn't deep, but it's carefully curated, and we liked that there were plentiful vegetarian options. We also liked that they were willing to adapt meaty dishes - like their eggs Benedict - to out veg requests. I had the most delicious heirloom tomato and avocado eggs Benedict. Every bite was sublime, and the salad they serve with it was perfectly dressed. We're currently looking for more excuses to be in Detroit soon so we can have more delicious food from the Dime Store. Warning, though: word has spread and there is quite a line on weekends."
5 star rating,"This is the absolute spot to grab breakfast in Detroit. Make sure you get the house made jam, it's an absolute MUST!"
5 star rating,"Love this place! Great food, drinks, atmosphere, and service. Only down side is that this place is so good that there is usually a decent wait, but it's totally worth it!If you're looking for a fantastic brunch in a chill environment, Dime Store is your place!"
5 star rating,"I absolutely love this place! The staff is always nice and the food is always great! The ""Duck Rueben"" is my fav...and the french toast is always amazing."
4.5 star rating,Cool little restaurant in the heart of downtown Detroit. Enjoyed my breakfast of the sausage hash (I subbed the turkey sausage) Had two of my sons with me and they had the veggie hash and the duck bop - duck bop was MOST HEARTILY enjoyed by my youngest! Would definitely return!
4 star rating,"My problem with Dime Store is just the pure inconsistency.  My coworkers and I had such a bad experience today, I had to come write a review again.  There was something wrong with every single order.When we picked up the food, we noticed that they overcharged one of us. They over charged her $5 and the cashier argued that what she charged was correct, we had to ask for the manager.  My omelet, which i ordered as a scramble, was missing the capers I asked for, I caught that before I left.  When I got to my desk I realized it didn't have the cheese I paid for though.  The poached pear salad one of us ordered had only two little pieces of pear in it and no goat cheese :-(.  The bacon on the bacon parm truffle fries was barely cooked at all.  The eggs in the hash that was ordered were supposed to be over easy, they were over medium for sure, maybe cooked a little longer than that.When you do a carry-out its hard to make these types of corrections once you get all the way back to your desk.  Sometimes my food here is excellent, but sometimes I have an experience like this.  Not sure I'll go here for carryout anymore."
2 star rating,"I have to update my review here because since my last one I have been back a couple times and tried other things.Lets start with the good stuff.  The parmesan truffle fries with bacon are soo good, they are my favorite.  The bacon just compliments the crispy outside of the french fries mixed with the truffle and parmesan taste.  I love em.  I also enjoy the salads a lot.  The simple salad add chicken or salmon is nice.  They have this lemon vinaigrette, it is the perfect salad dressing.  Light, just enough. My one complaint here is the service.  There have been three occasions where I waited too long to receive my food here.  The first two times I chalked it up to be because of lunch time, but the last time I was just upset.  It is when you see new people get seated and receive their food before you that you start to really have a problem.  I ordered the fries before hand as an appetizer, they took a whole hour to come and were brought with the salad.  Seriously?  An hour for a salad and some fries?  Not to mention my order was brought out well before my coworkers who go to just watch me eat.  I would have waited for her, but after an hour I was starving.  And all she ordered was french toast.  She said the french toast was awesome btw.Our waiter tried to make up for it.  He said a manager was coming over, but after that started to take forever he just comped the fries and we left.  I like the food here, but that long wait, they gotta do better."
3 star rating,"This place has a nice ambiance to it.  It's like Im very busy downtown today, but Im gonna stop here real quick to enjoy a quick bite.I havent tried brunch yet, only lunch.  Not impressed.  I wanted it to be so much better because I think its very cute and I liked some of the reviews.  But it was only ok to me.I tried there grilled chicken sandwich with apricot jam on it.  The jam was just too much.  The sweet flavor was over powering to the rest of the sandwich.  It was almost like it was an apricot jam sandwich with grilled chicken.The staff people were very nice, and I am still curious about brunch, so I'm gonna give it another try"
3 star rating,"Even after you wait you will be happy how tasty your meal is, how awesome your coffee will be and if you sit at the counter you have the treat of talking to ""Big Mike""! * I gave 4 stars because I don't like waiting an hour for a meal. Coffee service while you're waiting in the lobby would be great!"
4 star rating,"Prior to my recent trip here, I had asked a friend where to go and she came back at me with one answer: Dime Store.So on my Saturday here, I dropped by Dime Store around noon. There was a wait, but the hostess said it was 20 minutes, and true to her promise, it was indeed 20 minutes. The restaurant itself is located inconspicuously in the Chrysler House building. It's not huge so if you want to avoid a wait, get there early. We grabbed 2 beermosas, an order of Mothaduckin fries, an order of the cheesesteak benny, and a duck bop. I was happy with all that we ordered. I wasn't too blown away, but that being said, we did clear our plates. The cheesesteak benny, while semi-reminiscent of a cheesesteak, wasn't quite there - in other words, had I not known that ""cheesesteak"" was what they were going for and got this item blindly, I probably wouldn't have guessed it. I did, however, appreciate the salad on the side. The Mothaduckin fries were fatty, but oh, so good. I think that was the first to be demolished. And lastly, the duck bop hash - solid. Will I be back? Quite possibly.FYI:The restrooms are in the building, outside the restaurant but still within the building. Oh, and very clean."
4 star rating,Legitimate breakfast brunch spot with an interestingly delicious take on a breakfast burrito. Sub turkey sausage for the beef and it's still awesome. Need some energy? Ask for ginger beer with a splash of nitro  coffee. Their Spotify playlist will set you right. Don't let the generic facade fool you. This breakfast spot is one of a kind.
5 star rating,"Much anticipated to The Dime Store didn't disappoint. Went there for a Sunday brunch, and had the 30-40 minute wait that I anticipated. I went for a short walk around downtown and when I got back my table was ready within a few minutes.I would highly recommend the blueberry french toast. Amazing. Fair warning - you will need to do a few more walks around downtown to burn off the calories, but hey that's part of the game when you go out for a good brunch. (!)The Eggs Benedict were fresh, but the english muffin was really small and hard/almost crunchy. Overall they were good - not great.Seating is tight but the service is fast and the food is well above average. I hope you enjoy your visit to The Dime Store!"
4 star rating,"I just wish that I lived in Detroit so I could come to this place regularly. I also wish that they open earlier than 9am. I had the duck Reubens and my friend had pblt, the pork belly sandwhich. I tried both since we trade one with each other. Both are totally delicious. I fell guilty after chowing down the pblt sandwhich, but hey, you only live once!"
5 star rating,"Quick review update. I had the duck hash and wow!! One of the top 10% of breakfast dishes I've ever had! Tastes exquisite, very generous portion of duck. I absolutely loved it! Service was excellent (it was a packed Saturday morning and we had to get to the airport in an hour- our table was of 6). French toast is brioche and rich. Definitely a place to try for brunch in Detroit."
5 star rating,"Came here for a post-call Friday breakfast with 4 of my colleagues. We easily found street parking just around the corner (I heard they validate parking in a nearby structure, not sure which one). The place is rustic and trendy. At 8.30 on a Friday morning it was about half full. I got the smoked salmon Benny, and I LOVED it! The eggs were perfection, they had a very generous portion of salmon. It comes with cream cheese which I got on the side (trying to keep it low cal). And a huge portion of perfectly citrused spinach salad with cucumbers. The coffee was interesting, I liked it at first but it had a little bit of an after taste. All my friends loved their food. They serve alcohol. We were allowed to order certain things from the non-brunch menu which was cool (except for the Mac and cheese, but that's probably for the best!). I love that they open so early, as most of my dine out breakfasts are after a long call at the hospital, and the fact that they don't only have brunch on Sunday's. Best part is they're right in the D. I was too hungry to look at the rest of the menu, but I'll find it online and try something else next time."
4 star rating,"Dime Store has yet to let me down!!! Every time I have been there the food was amazing, I would make this my every weekend breakfast spot, but waits vary from 30mins to +1hr. Well worth the wait if you want a great meal. I rank this place to be in the Top 10 places to eat in downtown Detroit. What an asset!!! Great Job!!"
5 star rating,"I consistently go to the dime store for their Duck Bop. Man is that dish delicious! Their mac n cheese with brussel sprouts and bacon is also a winner. Also, be sure to peep at the specials menu because they always are serving up delicious items there too. If you sit at the bar you can get in and out pretty quickly during lunch time (weekdays). On the weekends there will most definitely be a wait (unless you go at 10am). Also, you're entire party must be there in order to be sat. So keep that in mind! This place is fantastic though. Great breakfast and lunch food. Solid Bloody Mary without too much flare."
4.5 star rating,"SO MUCH YES. The food here is incredible. My boyfriend and I came here with some friends on a Saturday morning and were really impressed. The food is incredible. Probably the biggest con I have is being so overwhelmed with how amazing all their menu options were that I had a hard time choosing what to get! Luckily, my boyfriend and I share similar interests in food and we split both our meals so that we could try two things.First of all, don't come here on a diet. Because, you are going to want to get the Bacon, Parm, and Truffle fries. SO GOOD. I could eat those for the rest of my life (I'm a big French Fry fan). We also seemed to be in a ""Duck"" mood that day. I got the Duck Reuben and he got the Duck Bop Hash. Both were fantastic although I enjoyed my reuben much more. Great portions too! I wish this place was open longer than 3pm. We didn't drink but, we did have a friend who ordered a Bloody Mary and let me try it. It wasn't anything special.Another con about this place is the small size and the loooong wait. If you are going to come on a Saturday or Sunday during peek brunch hours prepare to wait. We waited a good 20 minutes (and that was considered super fast). We were able to step up to the counter though and get a coffee and grab a to go menu to look over while we wait so it wasn't that bad.I definitely will be back to try everything else on their menu!!!"
4 star rating,"Cute cafe in a big building, almost missed it. Unique menu items, I had the smoked salmon Benedict which was so good. The homemade hollandaise really had a great flavor. Throw in some breakfast cocktails of bloody Mary's and peach mimosa and it's a hit! Service was also great!"
5 star rating,"Great food, great service. French toast is sooo good. Hard to get a spot on the weekends."
4 star rating,"Omg was this place worth the hour wait! Lauren was our server; beautiful, very friendly, and an A+ server. The spicy Korean fries (pictured, half order) were to die for."
5 star rating,"So good. Mother's Day brunch, wonderful service, wonderful food. 1st Time here and couldn't be happier."
5 star rating,"The eggs were poached pretty inconsistently. My friend and i had a good one and an overcooked one each. The portion is also pretty small in my opinion compared to other egg benedicts, but the flavors were very good. Probably would not come back due to the long wait and small portions."
3 star rating,"Great brunch with the rest of the Movement crowd.Sitting at the bar was a great opportunity to meet other festival goers and chat with Mike, one of the owners, about Detroit and festivals past. He makes a strong and spicy bloody mary, too!The hashes were a great way to go. Hard to choose between the sausage and duck bop. Unique flavors and nice portions.The wait moves quickly, so definitely be sure to wait in the big hall."
5 star rating,"Thanks to Yelp we stumbled across this place on our last trip to Detroit. Service was excellent and came with a small dose of sarcastic humor.The duck bop hash was different than my typical breakfast order, but exceeded all expectations. Zingerman's coffee and mimosas make this spot a must stop for future morning meals in the D."
5 star rating,"Absolutely delicious! Got the Bacon Avocado Omelette and it was so, so good. I think they must whip their eggs, as it had a fluffy consistency and the ingredients are well incorporated ion the omelette (versus just being thrown into the fold of the eggs). The potatoes that came on the side were tasty, crispy and a great compliment to the omelette. The atmosphere is fun and we had great, fast service too with lots of water and coffee refills (including a coffee to go!). Can't wait to go back!"
5 star rating,"Dank brunch spot. Long wait seems common but they have their system down so it moves along well.Great benedict and drinks. Friendly, lively atmosphere. Clean and delicious flavors. Hope to return one day! Thanks Detroit!"
4.5 star rating,"Reasonably priced, excellent food, attentive waitstaff and neat atmosphere- pretty much sums up this place. Only has breakfast and lunch all day (no big dinner entrees) but it is all delicious! Location is good- walking distance to campus martius. I'll definitely be going back."
5 star rating,"Once seated I decided on having the Eggs Benedict made in Philadelphia cheesesteak style. The eggs are fantastic they are cooked with a nice smooth yellow center and the English muffins are interesting seems like they're home cooked. They are smothered in shredded Philly steak and cheese. During the weekends,  It was a 45-minute wait and we were told as such. This also means I am already expecting the worst when I arrive at the table with a friend... I was pleasantly surprised. Being it is in Detroit and it is new in fame, I am forgiving the inconsistencies. The temps on my plate were varied from warm to very warm and again this something I forgive during the busiest day of the week. The ambiance was great, craft beer selection was in need of help, the liquor was fully stocked. It will be repeated and therefore it earns 5-Stars."
5 star rating,I'm not usually a big breakfast eater but every now and again it is a must while traveling. This place has friendly and attentive staff; best quality breakfast i have had in quite a while. Don't miss this one when in the D....get there early they fill up fast.
5 star rating,"Such a great place! I stopped in for lunch and sat on the counter. This is not a 5 min and your food is out place. It takes a little time, but worth it. Service is attentive, but no rushing and not in your face. I had the brussel sprout salad, a side of Mac n cheese, and orange juice. I wish I could have eaten it all, but the portion was a really good size. For me, location was perfect, near the convention center. The decor is so cute too!"
5 star rating,"Enjoyed a great breakfast in this quaint little diner located inside the Shoppes at Chrysler House.  Food is amazing, friendly service and piped in music from the 80's and 90's.  Ordered omelette and English muffin, it wad served with the BEST side of home fries I've had in years."
5 star rating,Great breakfast! Fantastic service. Jackie and Nicole are the hostesses with the mostest! Don't pass this restaurant up.
5 star rating,"My husband and I had lunch here today. Our server was excellent. She was friendly, and attentive. Our food was very good, and it came out quickly. The fries were perfectly cooked, our sandwiches were delicious and we will def be back."
4 star rating,"Amended Version after speaking with OwnerI found this place here on yelp and planned an Opening Day Brunch with my aunt and uncle. Reviews were good, and the photos showed good food so I was excited to try a new place down in Detroit. There was a 30 minute wait. No big deal. When we were brought inside I eyed the place and it was pretty cool. Great looks, cozy and good vibes. We did have a run in with a staff member but bygones will be taken care of. One thing I liked about the place was the bar. It could have used more than 2 beer choices but nonetheless a cocktail looked pretty easy up there. Another cool thing was the menu, there's rumor of local farms which is better but just looking at the menu was good enough. It was very eclectic and nice, cool niche dishes. I jumped right on the lamb benny. It was very delicious. Everything was cooked well. Everyone else enjoyed their dishes as well. I would recommend this place as I believe it is one that is going to be there as Detroit surges back. It's in a neat location and brings an awesome flavor to the city. I wish there was somewhere like this closer to my house that i could stop by on the way in to work."
3 star rating,Definitely recommend if you are in the Detroit area. Food was beyond great. Get a hash plate if you are there for breakfast. You won't be disappointed! I would get sriracha instead of the spicy ketchup if I would do it again. I'll definitely be back.
5 star rating,"This place rocks!  The best omelette that I've ever had!  Great service, ambiance, food and prices. Go and check it out!"
4.5 star rating,"Oh man... I was craving an amazing savory dish and the Spicy Belly Benedict killed it! Also, the restaurant is super hip but relaxed with excellent accommodating drinks. I feel like I'm in a Top Chef kitchen with all the fresh twists on the meals."
5 star rating,Love love love the food and spicy bloody mary's.  I go there for brunch but get there early AF so I don't wait that long for a table.  I would wait if I have to because the food is that good.  Duck confit is my fave
5 star rating,"Wow!  Just wow.  Came here for brunch and the place was popping.  Was a bit of a wait on a Sunday morning but sooo worth it.  I had the Duck Bop and my GF the Spicy Benny (we copied the people next to us)  and just because we are gluttons we ordered 2 half orders of fries (bulgogi and truffle) and the tussle sprouts.  The Brussels may have been the best I ever had, tangy and bright.   The duck hash was a celebration of flavor in my mouth, I almost couldn't eat it fast enough.  Seriously recommend this place.  If I am ever in Detroit again I am coming back!"
5 star rating,"Dawg not even gonna front, this spot is overpriced for what you get. location is a pain in the ass to get to because you got to find parking, then wait 20 min to get cold coffee. IHOP got unlimited pancakes with omelette right now so I won't be coming here for a hot minute. Sarah the only shining aspect of this spot dawg. b had this place poppin"
1 star rating,"Dime store never fails to provide an excellent casual dining experience!  The menu is eclectic in that it combines common food with a surprising touch which always delights all 5 senses!  On our last visit, we enjoyed the duck Rueben sandwich (- take your time and savor it!) - try it with a ""beermosa""!  And my son enjoyed the pbj French toast with peanut butter tinged whipped cream. Yum!  I think he actually said it was the best meal he's ever had!  High praise from a teenager! We were there at 2pm on a weekday.  Pleasantly busy but without the deafening sound of the lunchtime crowd.  The service is always top-notch -whether the restaurant is filled to the rafters or just a quiet hour. The price points on the menu  are also excellent.  Great value, wonderful food, near a great area of Detroit to explore!"
5 star rating,"Emmy English muffin was hard as a rock and the ""lemon vin"" that was supposed to be on my salad was nowhere to be found but everything else was good cool place but looks like they're getting beat up from all the hype that the attention to detail is lacking."
3 star rating,"Popular for a good reason. The food is fantastic, well prepared and unique. Service is fast yet friendly and relaxed, which means that nobody is rushing you. The interiors are also unique, with quirky art. The duck bop hash is my favorite but there are chef specials that don't disappoint either. They also serve Zingerman's coffee and have lots of drink options for brunch. It is small though and they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait unless you come when it opens (8am)."
5 star rating,AMAZING FOOD.I love brunch and this place is amazing.Long wait times but its very worth it.
5 star rating,"Food in here is extremely creative.I ordered their duck confit, which came boneless with cheese, on a bag of salads.Also, they have nitrogen infused cold brew, making the coffee smooth like Guinness with a head - major moustache time we are talking about here...I also ordered their pork rind with truffle oil.... truffle oil on pork rinds? It's taking good creativity to the next level. I love, love , love this city..."
5 star rating,I have to say the damn store is a fabulous place for breakfast. I've been there many times and that every time I go there are you blown away and from the service to the food to the ambience I can't imagine it were in Detroit having breakfast. Have to say it's a great place to have brunch or breakfast because they have both sides of the world. So many people who have not tried the dime store please make an effort to make a trip down to dime store at the Chrysler house. I was there when they opened the dimestore and 2014 I've been a regular customer for the past six years and I can tell you it does not change my opinion about a place to eat breakfast. I've tried many places in this country and for me that makes me wonder about other cities but when I'm home I definitely will go to dime store. I would say must try to French toast or other menu items because they make everything from scratch. I can't believe how that homemade made from scratch who is so divine. Makes me wonder about other person to treat have not tried I still think they're going to the same spot is a reputation that I cannot imagine thank you for having the dimestore in Detroit. So for quality and reputation and presentation and everything in that shell I can say I salute you.
4.5 star rating,"Not hip, not old school- just darn good. Excellent yogurt and granola. Had it with Korean  fries. Perfect combo! Coffee quite good for a just black drinker. Killer tunes too!"
5 star rating,"I'm a hesitant brunch person, but this was the most delicious place I have been to in years!! I had the hash and more than a few peach mimosas, while sitting at the bar. The bartender was super welcoming, and recommended more places we could visit on our day downtown. The only caveat are mimosas are always made with peach champagne and the taste is too sweet for more than one. Regular mimosas too please!!"
5 star rating,"5 stars ++Love this for a breakfast spot!Let me start from the beginning.  Some people may be discouraged to dine here if they are not familiar with the city and/or parking. But the great thing is the location is easy to get to and there is street parking all around.  And a tip to remember, you do not have to pay the meters on Sunday. (Fort street is full of street parking.)The restaurant is located in the Chrysler Building where the old Rio Wraps use to be. It is relatively small inside, but they do a good job of not having the tables on top of one another.They have a great breakfast menu which includes mimosas and bloody marys.  The bloody mary is tasty topped with a pickle and lime. They use a mix, but I didn't recognize the bottle. If you like home fries 100% hands down choose the hash. So So So So good!! Everyone I dined with chose a hash dish. I went with the veggie and the others had cornedbeef hash and a sausage hash. We all cleaned our plate! The portions are very generous.The service was great even for them being busy with a wait. Our server was great and super personable. Although I can not speak on their lunch menu I know if it is anything like breakfast then it is a must stop."
5 star rating,The menu was delicious. It was diversified and interesting. The pork rinds were delicious! The Korean fries were different and tasty. The mimosas were strong and tasty.
4 star rating,"The name says it all. This place is a dime/perfect 10.I've never been disappointed in anything I've had here to eat. From the delicious variations of fries, to the duck reuben, the breakfast food, I could go on...I would say try to avoid the lunch rush, it can get crazy. But that's because it's crazy good! And worth the wait."
5 star rating,"Came here on a Sunday around noon, which turned out to be massive human error... the place was PACKED and we waited for over an hour just to be seated at the bar. The food itself (got two skillets and Korean bbq fries) was pretty good but definitely overhyped. It was nice to come here once to check out the hubbub, but I wouldn't wait that long again!"
4 star rating,"I had been wanting to try this place for a while and finally had the chance to have lunch there last week.It definitely lived up to the anticipation! Great vibe and the place was packed!I had the veggie burger and loved it. I can't recall what kind of sandwich my friend had, but she loved it too!I will definitely be going back!"
5 star rating,"Quick service, easy in/out for a solo diner. The wait was an hour plus but they were able to sit me at the pass. I had the house made pork sausage, veggie omelette, fruit bowl and a coffee - just $21! It would be tough to come with a large group, but it looks like many people do. Food and ingredients were really fresh. I liked the oyster mushrooms and white cheddar in the veggie omelette--made it feel and taste very substantial. The fruit bowl wassliced strawberries, oranges, green apples, grapes and bananas. The coffee is from a local roaster - very nice cup."
5 star rating,"Great food, nice ambiance, reasonable price and friendly staff. The best part....breakfast all day! I had the BLTE (egg sandwich) in a brioche bun with a side salad. It was awesome! I'm definitely coming back for breakfast all day!"
5 star rating,"Oh my goodness. I've been putting off going here mostly because it's downtown (can never find parking), and I guess the name ""Dime Store"" wasn't ever appealing to me. I regret it now because all this time I could've come here for breakfast and brunch. They have pretty fresh and interesting menu items - I got the cold smoked salmon sandwich with the side salad, and it was wonderful. Every bite delicious, and it made me think the chef and owner put a lot of thought into their food. I'm not even one to say this, but all the elements of the sandwich were combined to perfection! Sauce, fried egg, greens, smoked salmon, slightly crispy brioche bun. I'm craving it right now.Overall, had a wonderful experience with a friendly waitress. Only downside is finding parking (I had to park and walk a couple blocks to the restaurant), but it's well worth it."
4.5 star rating,"Grabbed brunch at the Dime Store today and thoroughly enjoyed my meal. For a weekday, the location was busy but service was still exceptional. My meal (a bbq chicken hash from the Chef's Specials menu) was unique and delicious, without trying to be unnecessarily fancy or pretentious. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting downtown Detroit."
4 star rating,"I'll be quick: the coffee was a huge disappointment. It was weak and flavorless.  We actually sent t back and ordered the nitro cold brew, thinking that would surely provide the taste and power we seek.  It was definitely better than the drip coffee, but still lacked ""oomph"".  The food was good but also didn't knock my wig back.  Service was excellent. We come to Detroit often and know all the best spots around the city from our own explorations over the years, and our connections.  So we were excited to try this new spot that's been getting rave reviews.  I wish I could give a higher rating, but the coffee definitely killed it."
3 star rating,"I've never been to a more distinctly BRUNCH location than Dime Store.  From the drink options to the entrees, everything is geared toward being perfectly attenuated to brunch-time to the point that it would be almost strange to go any time other than the hours of 10-12 am.The el toro rojo is an awesome mexican-style benedict with chorizo; the bacon avocado omelette is pretty simple and self-explanatory but hits the spot perfectly; and the duck-bop hash is almost a signature Detroit dish.  For your lunchier fare, the duck reuben and cheesesteak are both awesome, and any sandwich can be made into a salad for a slightly healthier feel.  I'm not sure if this works well for every sandwich, but I tried the Korean BBQ as a salad and it was very legit.  The cauliflower cheddar soup (a chef's special, possibly limited time only) is a great antidote to the cold weather as well.Most if not all of their ingredients are sourced locally, and you can see on their website where everything is coming from.  Dime Store is a great, affordable option for people that actually work in Detroit and want something more than a coney (not that there's anything wrong with coneys)."
5 star rating,"The food was great as was our service.we got there early so there wasn't muc of a line. The house special ""rainbow waffle"" was great! Will definitely be coming back!"
5 star rating,"The food was sooo good!  I had the Benny CheeseSteak - 3 poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce on shaved steak, onion, shiitake mushroom and cheese on an english muffin, with a side of potatoes, instead of a side salad.  It was fantastic, I might get the salad next time as the potatoes were nothing special and maybe a little too dry for my liking.  My friend ordered the PB&J French Toast, that she said was great.    We also indulged in some tasty beverages - an Irish Coffee and a Bloody Mary, no complaints on either!  There was a 45 minute wait, but I think we may have waited 30 minutes in reality.  It is a small place with compact seating, but the atmosphere and servers were happy and busy!"
4 star rating,Loved this place!! The Bloody Mary with the pickle was LIFE!! I stepped into this place after a flight feeling sick and 2 bloody Mary's and the turkey sausage sandwich later I felt great.A must if your traveling and want some brunch.
5 star rating,"Off the hook. In the best wayMenu is wonderful, after countless visits, every dish has been a delight. Specials offer more chance for creativity if the regular menu isn't enough. Absolutely worth the wait. Service gets A+ too"
5 star rating,This place is such an added jewel to Detroit's dining experience. Great food. Slow service but somehow once the food came I didn't even care that it took so long. I've been here twice and never disappointed.
4 star rating,"Just stopped in for brunch. Delicious. Such an adventurous menu. As with anything, first impressions mean alot. The hostess was super nice and welcoming (even charged my friends phone.  Thanks) and our waitress Tamika was also very nice! She did a great job helping us figure out what to order, she was friendly and attentive. This started out our dining experience. Off to a good start! First up, pork Rinds,  good not great,  but definitely worth trying. The sauce at the bottom was very good. Next, cauliflower soup. AWESOME! I only wished it could have been hotter, but was still great. Finished up with BLT-E and roasted brussel sprouts. Delish!!! So, all in all a great dining experience. Would def come back and would def recommend you try it!"
5 star rating,"This is an excellent way to start your day! Once seated, we were sat at a two seater by the window. I ordered their pulled pork hash special which included pulled pork, an over medium egg (my choice), hash browns topped with Cole slaw. It was outstanding! Our waitress Christine was excellent ensuring that every patron enjoyed their own private experience. Overall, I enjoyed our visit very much."
5 star rating,"Breakfast is amazing here! Last time I went my food was room temperature and I normally feel so embarrassed to send it back. I did send it back and they were very gracious and attentive to make sure I was happy with my meal even on a busy morning. Very long wait on the weekends, but still worth it! Parking can be annoying just like anywhere downtown. If you don't want to wait, I'd get there as early as possible."
4.5 star rating,"After reading the reviews we had high hopes of liking this place. Unfortunately, the moment we walked in the building started off completely wrong. The reviews warned about the wait time so we were prepared to wait. However, the hostess was extremely rude and very dingy. We still decided to give them a chance. Placed our names on the list and patiently waited.After sitting and watching several groups of 4 or more be seated before our party of 2 I decided to return to the hostess to see where we were in line. The hostess said she thought she called our name and had scratched us off the list. How unprofessional. Not even an apology for the extra wait or oversight on her part. We were then seated in a small corner with the door to outside right next to the table and near the serving station for the waitress. The door was propped wide open and the cold windy day was turning this into a miserable experience. We asked to be moved and the manager was just as unprofessional as the hostess. We will not be returning!"
1 star rating,"I only gave this place two stars because my waitress was really nice. I had French toast, eggs with cheese and the housemade pork. The meat was so salty it could've given me high blood pressure, the eggs were runny and they don't even have grape jelly. What breakfast place doesn't have grape jelly. The seasoning they put on their breakfast potatoes is disgusting. I won't be returning"
2 star rating,"Came here for lunch and really enjoyed it!The space isn't huge but we came around 1pm on a Tuesday and it wasn't terribly crowded so we got a table right away. You can tell they do lunch for a lot of business folks in the area because they were on point with their service. Very fast and efficient. From our food coming out fast to our super attentive waiter. He was prompt but I didn't feel rushed. We were welcome to linger a bit after our plates had cleared and we paid our tab. But if we WERE in a hurry it would be great. Easy to get in and out in under an hour for sure. My girl Julia P got the mac & cheese while I, attempting to be a bit healthier lately, got the poached pear salad with grilled chicken. I stared at Julia's mac & cheese with sadness because it was everything I wanted (creamy, cheesy, carby) but then my salad was plated in front of me and I felt a lot better. It was great! Spinach, fennel, crunchy and spicy pepitas, creamy goat cheese, cornbread croutons, and a bacon vinaigrette. Lots of good textures and flavors all mixed together. Admittedly I didn't get a lot of bacon off the vinaigrette but it was still tasty. I was also glad they didn't drench the salad in dressing, it was just the right amount. The grilled chicken was the thicker half of a chicken breast, cooked perfectly (VERY juicy) and portioned just right. And for the record, I did have a bite of that mac & cheese and it was awesome. It made me a little jealous but not too much since my dish was so good.I thought for lunch the prices were pretty good (together our lunch was around twenty bucks) and the space is cool and convinenent when you're downtown. I'll definitely be back. Looking forward to trying it for brunch too!"
4 star rating,"Met a colleague here for lunch.  Arrived just after 1pm and were seated immediately, even though it was packed.  Close proximity seating permitted us to hear the table next to us complaining about their wait time for food.  Being our first time, we asked our server for recommendations, and she was helpful. We ordered the seared brussels sprouts as an appetizer, but it was not delivered until our meals arrived. Not a big deal, but generally when I order an appetizer, I would prefer to come before the meal.  My friend ordered the root omelette.  Tasty, decently sized, but the majority of the plate was taken up by potatoes.  Fruit cups were decently sized and had a nice variety of fresh fruit.I ordered the duck Ruben.  The doc was well-prepared, and the sandwich overall was very flavorful.  I would recommend. The bread was good, but dense, so the crust was a little tough to bite through.Overall, a good experience. I may come back for breakfast."
4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came here on Memorial Day while waiting for a flight that got delayed. It is a small restaurant with a long wait (I believe we waited for about an hour), but overall we had a good experience. The place is kind of difficult to find. It is located in the Dime building to the right just as you walk in. We were seated at the bar, which was a bit crammed. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We ordered the brussel sprout salad and the Philly cheesesteak benny. I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious both were, and despite the wait to get into the restaurant, we did not wait long for our food. I recommend this place to anyone roaming around downtown detroit looking for a good brunch spot. Just beware of the wait to get in."
4 star rating,"My favorite restaurant. Of all the places I've been this one is consistently good and has interesting specials. This place is ALWAYS busy but they move people through pretty quickly. I've tried Korean fries, Mac & cheese, house made sausage sandwich, nacho burger, a bratwurst, and a few drinks. All have been fantastic. can't recommend enough."
5 star rating,They brunch was amazing! I got the French toast and this is the best Detroit has to offer!
5 star rating,"We popped in for brunch on a Saturday and got lucky enough to get three seats @ the bar. Big Mike was awesome. The mimosas were awesome. My smoked salmon Benny, was also awesome. This is a cool spot and I'm happy to have experienced it on this trip back home.  Will be back for sure! My ONLY complaint would be the smokey smell. But that's a pet peeve I have. So if you don't mind smelling a little like a diner upon leaving... I'd say this place is well worth the trip!"
5 star rating,"Fantastic for brunch! I really enjoyed my Duck Bop Hash.  Long wait on a Sunday morning, but comfy seating in the lobby made it completely tolerable!"
5 star rating,"We went for lunch midweek. Busy, crowded, noisy, and delicious, with friendly staff everywhere. Definitely worth a stop."
4.5 star rating,BEST place I ate while my trip to Detroit! Our waitress Christina was AMAZING! She went above and beyond to make my last meal in the city enjoyable! We had to wait a little time to sit and eat! It was worth the wait. Please stop in if you are around you will be happy you did! Ask for Christina you will be happy you did! I give this place 10 stars

5 star rating,"Dime Store is totally trendy - and the wait gives that away right off the bat. We ended up waiting nearly an hour to get a table, and once we got in the service was a little slow, but I chalk that up to the restaurant being busy. The atmosphere was fun and quirky - as was the food. We loved the Korean fries and would recommend those to anyone whether they are popping in for breakfast or lunch!"
4 star rating,"Everything you think it's going to be! Ordered the sausage gravy and biscuits. I lived in Houston for a few years and let me tell you I know good biscuits and gravy.... This was a good whole new kind of delicious. I think it's the house made turkey sausage, but it was just right. The waiter had an extra order of pork rinds, with a spicy sauce on top, and a maple syrup on the bottom. I've eaten maybe four pork rinds in my life, they do not usually appeal, but these were perfect. My friend ordered the bananas foster waffles with mascara one, and the flavor balance was subtle and refreshing.  The wife ordered something with beets and sweet potatoes, neither of which I could ever review favorably, so.... The only thing I'd knock off a star for would be the bloody Mary, which was light on vodka but still tasted great. So I'll let it slide. Go early!"
5 star rating,"Recommended! Great service, cool staff, inspired menu. Got the duck leg confit Reuben and fried Brussels. This twist on the Reuben was unique, with pickled cabbage, Gruyere, and whole grain mustard. The duck was fantastic--soft, fatty and light. The rye for the Reuben was a little dry, but it's rye, so what did I expect? Really, it was just the crust, the center was soft and buttery. The Brussels were well prepared, but had mushroom (which I'm not a fan) and onion (which I don't eat if I'm working), but I was able to pick around them no problem. I was also given a cup of cauliflower-Gruyere soup on the house (don't know why, could be finishing the pot, could be I'm just lucky). Regardless, it was delicious. Creamy and smooth, a perfect warm-up served in a mug for a cold January day. The staff is pretty fantastic, not looking over my shoulder, but at the same time making sure my drink is topped off and I have everything I need (including an unexpected cup of soup). The music was great, too. Surprised to hear ambient electronic (lounge/chill), which complimented the meal nicely. Seriously good tunes. Now to get some mac and cheese to go!Update: the Mac and cheese with bacon was superb. Creamy with huge chunks of bacon; even hours later it was delicious. Came back for brunch today. Got the smoke salmon benny and it was delicious. Smoked salmon and hollandaise sauce (or even egg yolk) don't seem like they would work together, but they compliment each other nicely. Comes with a small side salad that was fairly basic, but wasn't drenched in dressing, which was a plus. It's also nice to see the kitchen staff in action. They work well together, churning out the non-stop orders quickly and efficiently. The bar tender is pretty cool, too. Thanks for some great meals, Dime Store!"
5 star rating,"WoW!!!  This place is AMAZING.  Friendly service, great unique menu, delish drinks, and the FOOD!!!!  Yum"
5 star rating,"One of my all time favorite brunch places in Detroit. The Egg Benedicts are absolutely to die for. If you're feeling adventurous the specials menu has never let me down. It's over all just a great brunch place, hasn't let me down yet and I'm for sure going back for more . Real quick though, there's this one waiter though, he looks like vin diesel he's a dick, wasn't friendly or courteous, we asked him to split the check because we were a big group but instead he complained and said it was too difficult and came back instead with all of our checks combined and asked us to split it ourselves and write the amount on the back."
4 star rating,"The variety of The Dime Store was pretty impressive and while we only ordered two plates and coffee, our neighbor's table had a variety that I wouldn't have expected (crackling chicharrones for breakfast - who would've known??). I had one of their specials for the day, jerk chicken hash. I picked it because it was different and I can say it was pretty good. Good serving sizes for sure. The coffee was a little thin for my liking but not bad. Flavors were good but did not knock my socks off (had I been wearing som of course! Lol). Decor was fun and modern. Service was good too. I'd say my Overall experience score is more like 3.55 stars."
3 star rating,"Super friendly people and well presented quality food make this a great ""go to"" spot for lunch or breakfast if you are in the area. I had the pork belly eggs Benedict and it was cooked perfectly. It could have used a bit more seasoning in my opinion but still a good experience. This location IS small and a bit noisey but isn't that what a diner is all about? Try it!!"
4 star rating,One of my favorite brunch spots! This is the first brunch place that comes to mind when I have people out of town come visit! I love the bulgolgi hash and the truffle fries are to die for! Always a long wait (because the foods so good) so make sure to come early!
5 star rating,Located in the Chrysler house. Closes @3 on weekendsIf ur in the area stop by. Enjoy
4.5 star rating,"Quality quality quality breakfast!!I stopped in for breakfast the morning after a Red Wings game and was quite impressed!Firstly, there was a wait.  I could tell that a lot of the customers were there because of the hockey game the night before but at 10am for a table of 4, we had to wait about 15min and another 15 min after we ordered to get our food.  It was well worth the wait!!The servers were very friendly and quick with drinks/refills.  They did their best to keep everyone happy until the food came out.For breakfast I got the cheesesteak benny, which was probably one of the best breakfasts I've ever had!  Eggs poached perfectly, cheesesteak was devious, and the onions were sautéed well so that they weren't overbearing.  So good!I noticed that there were so many little things that they did to enhance everything they made.  I shared some French toast and it was enhanced by a little cinnamon cooked in it.  The potatoes were crisped nicely and had some kind of delicious spice in them.  My wife loved their omelettes and couldn't describe it but said they were the best omelettes she's ever had.  Even the toast was good!  It was thick and tasted better than just store bought toast.The restaurant itself was quite nice.  A bit cramped but was very clean and had a modern look and feel to it.If you're staying in the downtown Detroit area and looking for breakfast, I highly recommend the Dime Store!  Such a strange name but you won't be disappointed!"
5 star rating,"This place is a little fun joint to try out. They are open for breakfast, lunch, and bar food. We tried it out for dinner so we ate off the lunch menu and got an appetizer off of the bar food menu. Good selection of sandwiches and the bread is really good here! They are very kind and provide excellent service. Would definitely come back for brunch to try out that menu as well. Overall, I had a good experience."
5 star rating,"Good coffee, why does coffee make me so tired? Oh, I think it's all the food I just ate! Very good hollandaise! Yum"
4 star rating,"I love this place.  Anytime I have the opportunity to eat here, I take it.  I have never been disappointed.   Sundays expect a line up, but it is worth the wait."
5 star rating,Came for brunch and loved it! Food was delicious. A bit crowded and noisy but nothing annoying. Definitely recommend!
5 star rating,"Got here just after open on a Saturday. We were seated immediately. It's now an hour after open and the place is packed full. We're sitting 6 inches from another table, which is fine with us, but if you don't like to get up close and personal with strangers, perhaps come when it's less busy. As far as the food, I need to come back for lunch, because every single plate that came out of the kitchen looked absolutely amazing and they obviously care about presentation here. The sausage is house made, and delicious, and getting the sausage hash was a great choice. Full bar all day is a plus too.Highly recommend."
5 star rating,Always good food.  Fresh and well prepared.  There wait was long but the kept the restaurant from being chaotic.  Well managed.
5 star rating,"The food is yummy, service was great ! The only thing I wish I could change were my BURNED turkey sausages. They were really burnt. Other than that everything was great and it's Black owned which is also great"
5 star rating,Small place and the wait for 45 minutes but I enjoyed the food and staff. I got the avocado bacon omelette and a peach mimosa and the mimosa with absinthe. I'd go back for sure.
5 star rating,"The Dime Store was fantastic. From the service to the food and the ambiance, it was top notch. My husband and I went there for breakfast yesterday for the first time. He ordered the house-sausage hash and I had the strawberry brioche french toast. Both were amazing. The house-sausage hash was an explosion of flavors without the grease. The potatoes had a slight crisp on the outside, the sausage was lean, and the addition of avocado and hot sauce rounded out the dish. The strawberry french-toast wasn't overly sweet, the strawberries were fresh and exploding with flavor.I highly recommend the Dime Store. It was the best breakfast we've had in a long time... and we've been to most the well-known breakfast restaurants. Dime Store topped them all!"
4.5 star rating,"A very delicious brunch experience! I had the Frenchman's Hash and we shared an order of Korean BBQ fries. Both of which were amazing. The fries were unique and unlike any other ""loaded fries"" I have tried. Would definitely recommend!While it is a little bit of a smaller space for a restaurant as busy as they were, they have a very nice waiting area and definitely seemed to know how to handle the flow of things. The wait was similar to, if not less than what they quoted."
5 star rating,"Love this place, hate the wait times but if you go earlier Sunday morning when everyone else is at church it's not too bad. I would recommend the speciality french toast if that is an option, if not then you should definitely just get the brioche French toast, the Benny's are awesome we tried the cheeseteak and the cold smoked salmon. I have nothing bad to say about this place but the wait times..."
4 star rating,"I have been wanting to try this place since they opened. Since it is located in downtown it was a bit annoying finding parking. I really appreciate dining associations with parking. Anyway, this place is located in the Chrysler house, first floor. The wait wasn't as bad as I expected. 15 minute wait for a party of 2 around 12:30pm on a Sunday. We waited and chatted in the comfy seats in the lobby. The decor here is very hip and wooden chairs and seats rooted to the floor. The staff like some other reviews mentioned, have bright pink hair and the place is filled with hipsters. I ordered a Ghiradelli hot chocolate - perfect weather for some nice hot chocolate. It came in their black dime store mug. It didn't look too fantastic but it was delicious. Veggie Hash: If you have been an avid follower of my reviews you know how much I love breakfast potatoes that is why you aren't surprised I ordered this. All the other items comes with a side salad instead of potatoes. This was tasty and I actually had to save some for another meal because it was pretty hearty. The potatoes were good but I have had better. My friend ordered:Veggie burger: She finished it all so I am assuming she enjoyed it. Seared Brussel Sprouts: Snack portion. A touch of sweetness. A light snack. Like other reviews mentioned order it! Its good! Overall, I am not sure if I would make my way back here especially with the parking situation but it was a good experience."
4 star rating,I had a late breakfast there while in Detroit for work. It wasn't bad. It wasn't exceptional. Just okay. Not a bad restaurant. Not great or in any way memorable.
3 star rating,"Great joint, pretty cozy atmosphere with amazing food. Try the Korean fries! They're not shy on big flavor & fat, but offer a side salad instead of potatoes with the breakfast dishes, which was a nice change of pace. There was a bit of a wait (we went on a Saturday) but a really nice waiting area with couches and plenty of space."
5 star rating,This place has hard core wait issues but it's a tiny place with some bomb ass food. So in the end it was worth it. I'd prefer Commonwealth in Birmingham.
5 star rating,"I love coming here for breakfast during the week, the bartenders are fun to talk to and the service is great. As far as the food goes, you really can't go wrong with ordering. The weekend is expectedly packed unless you get there before 9, but the lobby is nice to sit and wait in, or head over to Bon Bon Bon for chocolates or Drought for some juice while you wait."
5 star rating,"This is the best restaurant in the city of Detroit. I have been there on numerous occasions for various reasons: staff breakfast, catching up with friends, and dates. I usually get the sausage hash, which is delicious, and so are their French toast variations. The hash dishes are plentiful. I have never left hungry. I have always had a great experience with the server as well. It is also located in a beautiful building. The only down side is parking. Be prepared to circle around the building several times and/or parking and walking multiple blocks."
5 star rating,"I enjoyed my food here and the service was good.Came here on a Friday afternoon around 3ish. They have a tiered happy hour for 50% off drinks 3-4, 40% off 4-5, and 30% off between 5-6pm.It was pretty empty which was nice. I heard the the place can get pretty crowded on the weekends.After deliberating on the menu, I decided on getting duck confit hash.I enjoyed the duck confit hash. It came with what seemed as a pulled duck confit with chopped up potatoes cooked in some sort of a glaze. There was a characteristic sweetness to it which I felt complemented the crispy potatoes well. Also came with an English muffin with some Jam. The duck itself was a little bit drier than I was used to. You might have noticed that I mentioned that it almost seemed like a ""pulled duck"" confit. Duck confit is supposed to be a food that is cooked slowly over time within its own fat. It is supposed to be tender and moist, and not of a stringy consistency.Another caveat though, was that my egg was unevenly cooked. The hash came with two eggs over easy on top. One of the eggs was completely cooked through and the yolk was solid (shame), but my other yolk was still runny. It was a bit of a disappointment for me as I like to play with my food by breaking the yolk and mixing it up in the hash.I also got the beermosa which is basically OJ + beer. The beer selection here is a little scarce. Only had atwater dirty blonde and bells soft parade. I figured the fruitiness of the soft parade would complement the OJ well, and it did. Also had my friend's bloody mary and it was solid.Overall, I am not sure if I would wait in a long line or anything like that for the food here, as I thought it was good, but not anything particularly special. If I am in the area I will try again (which I will be). With what I had I would rate it at 3.5 stars, but I am going to round up (you should really have half stars yelp). I'll give them the benefit of the doubt until I can try some more items on the menu. Happy eats!"
4 star rating,Great ambiance and food tasted great.. service was prompt. Brought my family for breakfast and everyone enjoyed their meal.
4.5 star rating,Had the duck bop. Hands down the best hash brown meal around. Highly recommend. May have a little bit of a kick with the Kimchi but I didn't notice it.
5 star rating,"It's like a fancy waffle house, but the flavor isn't quite there.Had high hopes with the ratings, and it really was only average. The menu sounds good, had a chef's special of lamb benedict. Not a lot of flavor, lukewarm, and overall just not great. My son had an omelet which was just a regular omelet, again not much too it. Wouldn't recommend."
3 star rating,"Great place! The menu was very exciting and Fresh. I really enjoyed the burrito. I was impressed how quickly the food came out, considering how busy they were. I'd come again for sure!"
5 star rating,Glad to have this addition downtown! A lot of the businesses in this area only cater to the 9-5 work crowd and serve breakfast and lunch only. Kudos to this new hot spot for staying open until 9p during the week and hosting brunch on Weekends. The servers are eager to make sure you are content. The food is beautifully plated and there is clearly an attention to detail when it comes to the flavor profile. I will be back again soon.
5 star rating,"Perfect. Came here on Thanksgiving and had, quite possibly, the best poached (hard) eggs of my life. Will definitely be back! Sure do wish they were open on Sunday. We need more solid Sunday brunch options in Detroit.Update:....and now they're open on Sunday! Went back my second time thinking, ""what are the odds they'll poach my eggs perfect again?"" - and they DID. This place is a gem."
5 star rating,Go early. If you go within the first hour or two you probably will get seated right away but wait much later and you'll be looking at least an hour wait.Food was good and service was wonderful. Would recommend to anyone looking to get brunch downtown.
4 star rating,"It must have been our lucky day because we had about a 2 minute wait on a Saturday around 11. We were seated at the bar. There is a great energy and feel to this place - it's got cool music and decor and was super busy.My guy ordered the smoked salmon benny. He really enjoyed it but was a little thrown off by the chilled salmon which made the eggs get cold quickly. I got the avocado and tomato breakfast sandwich. Simple but very fresh tasting. We split a side of potatoes which felt like a very bland after thought - no seasoning, dry, boring. All in all a great, energetic place!"
4 star rating,"In the past I would have rated Dime Store(DS)a 5+. Our work location is what initially lead us to the Dime Store and we enjoyed the food so much that on non-work days we would pile the family into the car and make the long drive in for a late breakfast/lunch. Hours of operation are from 8:00am-3:00pm. For no apparent reason our journeys to the DS have been less frequent. We typically order the same items at each visit: Bacon Parm Truffle Fries; Spicy Korean Fries; Various Omelets; Breakfast Sandwich;Special French Toast of the day and anything with the House-made Spicy Sausage for sure!! My fav used to be the hash potatoes served with breakfast. They were so good we can get side orders too! We kind of just put all the food in the middle of the table and have a family style type feast! Over the last 8 months or so the Hash Potatoes have evolved into nothing but their fries cut up into little squares prepared exactly like... the fries. Needless to say an order of fries are easier to eat than balancing these ""little hard dry nuggets"" on a fork. Honestly, these used to be so good they have  side orders on the menu. We are potatoes with our breakfast people. I tried smashing/cutting them but they kept flying off of my plate and even mixed with my eggs they flew off my fork! Just wasn't happening! Lol I have to say that you must try the different french fry options. The Spicy Korean Fries are the best!!! The sausage yummy too! Still worth trying. Just not the same"
3 star rating,This is our favorite place for breakfast.  The food is consistently delicious and the servers are always wonderful.
5 star rating,"awesome food, but get there early they are constantly busy.   Worth the wait."
4.5 star rating,"I absolutely love the Dime Store. I worked in the Chrysler House for a while and having this place on the first floor was dangerous! They have something on their menu for everyone, whether you want a simple yogurt with honey and fruit for breakfast, or a salmon eggs benedict, or a duck reuben, or a poached pear salad, or a kickass burger. They have SUCH a good menu! You can expect to wait for a table, since the food and drinks are so delicious. Make a morning/afternoon of it!"
5 star rating,Loved this restaurant while we were visiting Detroit. The oatmeal with strawberries was excellent!
5 star rating,"Everything I've ever had at Dime Store has been exceptional. Their staff is also extremely pleasant. My only complaint would be the long wait they usually have, but it's worth it!"
5 star rating,"If you don't frequent Detroit often you may struggle to find this place, but it's just inside the Chrysler building on the corner of Griswold and W Fort St. There is usually a wait to eat here, but on a Wednesday around 1pm we managed to snag a table right away. We were sat pretty close to the table next to us--I joked that it felt like we were on a blind double date--but the volume of noise was perfect enough that we couldn't overhear each other's conversations. My friend got a delicious cider and I sipped on a decent sangria. I have high standards for sangria, but this one wasn't bad. What I liked is if you have a larger group you can get a full pitcher and save money in the long run! Our food was scrumptious. I got the chicken pesto sandwich with fries--which were delectably seasoned with salt and some fancy green stuff (foodies you'd know what it is). Only complaint, which is only relevant if you're a ketchup addict, is that it is served on the side at your request. This makes most sense for the business and size of the tables, but I don't like having to ask for more and in such a process admit that I consume way too much ketchup for a normal person. The sandwich was flavored greatly, but since it is made with a thicker serving of chicken, it seemed a dash dry. The vinaigrette that was drizzled on the side with it could maybe be served in a side cup with the meal as well to add to the sandwich if desired? I felt guilty dipping my sandwich with such bomb flavors in ketchup, but it needed something in my opinion. I definitely recommend going here despite my small comments. Our ""blind date's breakfast looked extremely appetizing as well--looking forward to trying out more on the menu in the future."
5 star rating,"Great breakfast had the meat omelet, did not care for the housemade sausage but everything else was delcious. Loved the open kitchen and the bar seating right in front of it so you can see your food being freshly made."
4 star rating,"Back in Michigan to see my daughters. Spent the day in downtown Detroit and we had to go to the Dime Store for brunch. My daughter raves about it and she is right. It was bustling inside. Adorable decor. The staff was very inviting and the Peach mimosas a must have. Had the special with turkey sausage, stuffing cakes and cranberry sauce topped with poached eggs and hollandaise. Oh My! Hurry in specials are changing soon.  Sorry no picture. I was too busy enjoying."
5 star rating,"Great breakfast!, Un burrito con huevo, frijoles, carne y queso! Sat at the bar among strangers, Antonio at the bar attend me-Great service, Thanks Antonio. The girl to my left said hello. So I gave Antonio a 25$ tip and paid for the girls breakfast too."
5 star rating,Great little breakfast joint with super fresh ingredients and unique menus items. They have a cafe on sight as well and I'd recommend their chia tea latte. Make sure you get their early or be prepared to wait a little as this is one of the most popular breakfast/brunch spots downtown.
5 star rating,"Do yourself a favor and go here. Now!  I'm from silicon valley and accustomed to a super diverse, chill crowd, and i felt right at home here. I mean it really felt like i was home, and that feeling is unparalleled. So now that we've established that the vibe was awesome, i can tell you the food was even better. Top notch doesn't even do it justice. Flavorful, unique, comforting, and moist of all, delicious. Seriously, this is one of the best places in all of Detroit to eat. I love it and will be coming back again and again!"
5 star rating,"I'm not a fan of community seating. By community seating, I mean the type of seating where you sit at a table with other strangers. For example, my mom and I came here for brunch on a Sunday. After waiting an hour, the hostess sat us at a table that seated four. I had no issues whatsoever until ten minutes goes by and the hostess seats two people at our table. My mom and I were sitting there enjoying our orange juice and all of a sudden we are joined by two random people. This was especially awkward because my mom and I are private people. We didn't even feel comfortable having a conversation because the people next to us were sitting about six inches away from us. If you are fine with this, you'll probably enjoy this place. The food was OK. It was a small portion of food. I was still hungry when I left and I'm an average woman. Honestly, the community seating ruined the entire experience. I wouldn't recommend this place."
4.5 star rating,"The Dime Store has been a Yelp Bookmark for quite awhile.  I had tried to go previously but finding parking in this area is tough-I would love if any Yelpers have (reasonably priced) parking tips for this area please share!  Anyways, I saw on FB they were open at 10 am for brunch on New Years Day so I rustled the family out of bed so we could hit the road to be there by 10. We actually got in around 10:30 (again the parking...) and had a wait-but thankfully there is a big beautiful warm lobby to wait in (which should have a coffee shop-big opportunity!).  3 of the 4 of us got the hash which was dee-lish and my husband and I both ordered a bloody mary (simple-not overdone, Vivio mix, McClure pickle).  It was the perfect breakfast/brunch to kick off the New Year!"
4 star rating,"I've been here twice, and I gotta say it's pretty darn good. Be prepared to wait, but remember that you can walk down the block and gawk at the amazing architecture in the Guardian building or go to Bon Bon Bon and squee at all of the beautiful expensive chocolates.I have tried two sandwiches, because (gasp) I don't really care for eggs, which eliminates many brunch foods. The chicken salad sandwich is pretty much the perfect chicken salad sandwich (I have had maybe two that rival it), and that means a great deal coming from me, because I consider myself an expert in the very basic, very simple thing that is chicken salad. People think it's boring and easy but it is sometimes the simplest things that are actually the hardest to pull off.And it's good. Even better with an order of the super addictive and really good fries, which might be my favorite fries in the city. Next time I'm just throwing caution to the wind and getting the loaded fries because **** it, it's brunch and there are no rules."
4 star rating,I had breakfast here this past weekend. I am from NYC-I saw good reviews - and was not disappointed! Got there early so luckily no wait. Very good experience & friendly server. Best truffle fries ever!
5 star rating,"We came on a Sunday morning around 8:30am and there was no wait. The food was delicious. I had bacon avocado omelet and my husband had a seasonal french toast. Both were terrific. Although, the coffee was not our preference. It was very strong and bitter. We realized it was Zingerman's coffee which we have always had bad luck with in the past. I wish they offered an alternative. The server was very friendly and attendant. I would love to try other dishes but I would skip the coffee next time. What I really like though, is that they offer a fresh weekend breakfast that isn't a $20+ brunch buffet."
5 star rating,"Great restaurant! It's really small so you may have to wait but they try to keep the lines moving quickly. We went on a Saturday for brunch and had to wait about 20-25 minutes.The staff is really friendly and helpful. If you don't like sitting in tight small places this may not be the place for you. The decor gives the restaurant and old 50s vibe. It's located in the Chrysler building.I had the salmon Benny, and oh my was it gooooood! I would highly recommend it! The Benny comes with salmon, poached egg, capers on an English toast and a side salad. It was a perfect combination. If it was just the Benny it might have been to salty, but the salad helps to reduce that. Definitely a good find in Detroit!"
4 star rating,"very good, cool spot, moderate wait. Great food. :)"
4 star rating,"Took my daughter here ,had an amazing experience really enjoyed everything She is vegetarian sometimes hard to please but found some stuff she loved and I did as well ,peach mimosas taste great ,awesome brunch place ! Well done !server/bartender was Kari nice gal!"
5 star rating,"I had been looking forward to visiting this place for a while now. Several of my friends recommended it and after reading so many positive Yelp reviews, I knew I had to see what all the fuss was about. I arranged to meet several of my favorite gals there for brunch today at eleven. We should have come earlier. When I finally located the place (it's inside the Chrysler House), I checked with the hostess to get my name on the list and to inquire about the wait time. It was 45 minutes to an hour for a table. I wasn't in a rush so I agreed and we headed over to Starbucks to kill some time. After returning, we were seated. The wait time was accurate, as we were seated after about 55 minutes. The restaurant space is cute. I like the cozy feel of the place. Our waitress promptly brought us water and took our drink orders, despite it obviously being a busy time. She was very helpful and offered her suggestions. We ordered the sausage hash with turkey sausage and I ordered the Brussels sprouts. The food took a while, which I anticipated due to the crowd. But, once it arrived, OMG! Everything was delicious. The food was hot, fresh and many of the ingredients are locally sourced. Overall, the food is delicious and the service is excellent. Just keep in mind that this place is popular so you may have a wait. Bring snacks."
4 star rating,"This was my second time here for brunch, I liked it. It's usually always busy with a line but it's a coo place to check out if you're in the area."
3 star rating,"I live about 30 miles away and found this little gem via an online search. I am so glad! Whenever I'm in Detroit I try to stop here. Although there's usually a wait, its ALWAYS worth it.Among my favorites are the duck bop hash, cheese steak benny, and bacon parm truffle fries. Everything is cooked beautifully and I've never had anything short of a great experience.If you haven't been...GO!"
4.5 star rating,"I Like Ike. And so does the Dime Store! At least that is my assumption with their giant print of him. If Dwight D. Eisenhower like's a place then I'm game. As expected on a Sunday afternoon it was buussssy- 40 min wait (told 1 hr) for 2 people around noon. We got seated at the bar- but were at the far end so we couldn't see anything cool happening behind the counter. There menu has a decent spread of sweet and savory. Not a ton of options- but options none the less. I loved that they had a beer menu for brunch. Trying a local Atwater beer definitely hit the spot. The wait for the actually food was a while (20 minutes or so) after we ordered. When my peach crisp french toast came out though it was worth it. I am normally not a french toast type of person because I feel that cinnamon can overwhelm things easily, but I will do anything for grilled peaches. To perfection- the french toast was thick and crispy with a little hint of cinnamon paired perfectly with the peach jam. The real star of the show was the grilled peaches. I am pretty sure if I just had those for a meal I would be content. Pricing was fair-with my total check with tip around $20.A note on parking- If you park in their garage and ask the waiter for a validation ticket it will cover 2 hrs. Unfortunately with the wait and then use exploring the Riverwalk afterwards we far surpassed that and ending paying $10 for parking for the day. The ambiance of the restaurant itself is hipster- busy- loud rockish music-with wooden tables and exposed industrial ceiling. An interesting mix but a good vibe."
4 star rating,Small diner style place with a smaller menu. I was there at 1pm and not in the mood for breakfast so I decided on a burger. Much to my surprise the burger was outstanding and bursting with flavor.  Had the Mac and cheese and added bacon lardons which was very tasty. I'll be back in the future as this place was very good.
4 star rating,"I'm missing something here. Are there two Dime Stores in Detroit? The one I went to was nothing like advertised. The food looked nothing like those pictured. Even the signature dishes that people talk about weren't on the menu I was given. I double checked the address but it matched. I've heard good things about the Dime store for a while now. I had really been looking forward to go there. We all left disappointed. We had a group of four that went here before a Lions game. Maybe the menu is different on game day's? We've eaten at a lot of restaurants in Detroit. I'd rank this one as average. There are far better breakfast shops in Detroit. Some real hidden gems that I won't mention because I hate long waits. For those who don't mind long wait times. The Hudson Cafe near by is far superior and has a slightly longer wait time than the Dime store. So expect to wait 30-45 minutes or longer to be seated. I had an omelet, my wife had the French toast. The food was good not great. Nothing special at all. In fact I felt my portion size was small compared to what you get from other restaurants in the area. For example I received one slice of toast instead of two. Come on ... everyone gives you two slices of toast for breakfast. My wives French toast was two slices of toast. She said it was over cooked and dry. At least she got two slices of toast ...lol ... my omelette had some nice options that you don't normally see. So I was excited to order but overall the omelette was just average. The potatoes were a nice surprise and very flavorful. The ambience was extremely crowded, the floors dirty, and not what you'd expect from a 5 star rated restaurant. Literally I was rubbing elbows with the table next to me and my back was against the person seated behind me. Very crowded. The building it's in is a trendy little building but the restaurant wasn't. However I'd says it's on level of what I'd expect in the busy downtown area.  Our waiter was nice, attentive but not overly friendly. I say he was average to above average. My wife said this was 2 stars I felt 3 stars. Needless to say I don't expect to come back and I wouldn't recommend it."
3 star rating,Nice trendy place in Detroit for breakfast. The food was delicious and had great service. We will definitely go back when we are back in town.
4 star rating,"A delicious duck for the dapper, debonair, duke of detroit. Ambience 4: located in the old dime bank building, it has a sophisticated feel with a hipster undercurrent. The set up is open but fairly small. It has a smaller bar, that fits maybe 8 people. If you're looking to watch a game, this isn't the spot, due to no televisions, which I'm okay with.  It has a private table, which would be great for a small get together of yelp elitists.Food/spirits 5: I had the duck bop to eat. It invaded my palate with notes of sweet, acidic, freshly cut flowers, rainbows, and gum drops. Basically delectable. I drank multiple mouth watering mimosas. By the time I left I was no longer a sophisticated duke but a drunken dullard.Service 5: The service was plodding. Luckily, our server and host were extremely friendly and polite, which made up for their sluggish service. They were also really busy, so I understand the difficulties of maintaining prompt service when a restaurant is filled to capacity.Overall I had a great experience and I plan on gracing them with my presence again. That could be the most self centered sentence I've ever typed...haha"
5 star rating,"I got takeout for lunch and was really impressed when the person that cashed me out opened every single container to review the order.  Such a simple step, but so great, as anyone that gets frequent take out knows.I ate the Korean bulgogi fries and they were pretty fantastic, something I would gladly go back for.  The pickled vegetables paired perfectly with the fries and shaved beef."
4 star rating,"While visiting Detroit for the auto show I searched for the best breakfast/brunch place and I think I was lucky from the very first attempt. The Dime Store came on top of the list and without any doubt we headed to the restaurant to enjoy some food. There's a bit of onstreet parking in front of the restaurant (I wouldn't count on it) and a few lots right across the street. The waiting time on the weekend might be up to 30 mins depending on the party size and preference of bar/table but it's worth it regardless! We were actually seated pretty quickly at the bar. The menu has all sorts of things but their hashes stand out and I recommend ordering one of them (look on the right side of the menu for a special hash!) Our food arrived quickly and everything was perfectly delicious. We had the sweetest server and our bill came out to be very reasonable. I'd totally recommend this spot for dining out for families, couples, and singles any day of the week!"
5 star rating,I love brunch here.  The Spicy Korean Fries were the surprise star of the show. The service was prompt and very pleasant. Our server brought over some little toys for my 3 year old niece. Can't wait to go back.
5 star rating,"Well I was really looking forward to trying this place out for brunch recently. I came down to the Dime Store on a Saturday with some friends to try out their brunch menu. I am not a fan of frequenting downtown because of the battle to find a parking spot..this is not a fault of this resturant, it is just my own pet peeve.  When we arrived at the host stand we put ourselves on the waiting list and waited to be called. They're customer traffic slowed down soon after we got a table which I expected.  While this place was crowded and is not huge, I was still able to hold a conversation with my table without having to yell across the table. My excitement to come here had me look at the menu before arriving so I had an idea of what I wanted.  I ended up ordering a coffee, and the bacon avocado omelette with potatoes and a side of fruit.  I was not a fan of the coffee. I found it to be very bitter. My omelette was OK. I am not sure exactly how else to describe it as it did not blow my mind. The potatoes that I had been looking forward to were really dry. SUPER disappointed. The fruit bowl was pretty big and I enjoyed it.  My friends ordered the b.l.t.e sandwich and cheese-stake benny's. They said their meal was OK- again nothing that would blow your mind.  My friend also ordered a mimosa and it was kind of lame seeing the Tropicana carton sitting on the bar while she was sipping her drink and the obvious up charge for it. The customer service was normal. Our server did her job and had a smile on her face the whole time. I was once told by a server friend that a serving job is similar to an acting job and  you're on stage. She did well in my book. I am not going to write this place off yet because there are more items I want to try on the menu, and I really don't want to judge them based on one meal I had here. I think they have a good thing going here and I will be back."
3 star rating,Great atmosphere! Good coffee Specialty drinks! Unique food options and delicious food! Friendly staff too!!
4.5 star rating,"This place represents, however it should not be confused with the dime store, music venue close by (although I was welcomed there and it turned into a fun night too).Great beer / breakfast pairings (for dinner).They do close early and are in a office building, so be aware.I will be back next time I am in Detroit!"
5 star rating,Enjoyed the food and ambiance! Great service and meal. Seated quickly. Small but good.
5 star rating,"Working in Detroit, I eat here once a week. Everything is a good with new specials consistently. Price is fair for creative good food. Would love to come on a weekend and try their drinks."
5 star rating,There food use to be so good when they first started . Now they suck . The food is so nasty . I waisted $29 bucks .. they got the name fromWhere they first opened .but now they suck. Sad to say. Maybe they changed chefs . Nasty Mac n cheese . Where's the cheese
1 star rating,"Went there for brunch, fairly close to closing time.It was packed, and they fit a lot of people into a tiny spot.  My friend and I shared the Sausage hash sub turkey sausage instead and Smoked Salmon benny, and two mimosa'sEggs were done perfectly on both, not overcooked (which believe me is quite common unfortunately)portions were a good size. mimosa's should be called OJ with a splash(maybe even a dash) of champagne. Quite lackluster and definitely not worth the 7 dollars each. Service was fast and our server was great. If we go back there will be no drinks. Overall fun time with delicious food."
4 star rating,"Lunchtime on Wednesday. Very busy time of day, arrived just before noon and had a 25 min wait. Not that the place is small so if you're going during prime meal times go early. Seating is tight so you will close to the next table or side by side at the bar. Menu selection has nice options for breakfast and a few sandwich and salads. I went with a veggie omelette- which was OK, however the hash browns were a miss. They were not hot or crispy. Chicken salad sandwich was good, but seemed lacking in the amount of chicken(large chunks, large pieces of walnuts, Large pieces of grapes). Service was friendly, prices fair, just too long a wait for too little return."
2 star rating,"DELICIOUS food!! I LOVE the Korean fries. The salmon benny is delicious, fresh, filling.  excellent food, excellent service!  everyone is so friendly."
5 star rating,"Fantastic breakfast/lunch place in downtown Detroit.  Waited around 45 minutes after getting our  name put down and getting a number.  It was no problem because the lobby of the building has couches and seating.  Ordered:1.  Spicy pork belly Benny.  Hubby loved this one- it's a slice of fried pork belly on jalepeno relish on a crumbly biscuit with a perfectly poached egg on top.2. Cheese steak Benny.  This was my favorite - cheese on steak on a crumbly biscuit with a perfectly poached egg on top.3. Spicy Korean fries.  This was very tasty; fries topped with bulgogi, siracha mayo, Korean sweet pickled daikon and carrots.4.  Chai latte- perfect chai flavor, creamy and foamyHubby wanted the fries to be more crispy and the biscuits to hold up more (English muffins are usually more sturdy).  He liked the lemon dressing but I would preferred less acid.Breakfast was $40 (tip not included).  The servers are fantastic!!!"
4 star rating,"Needed a quick hearty breakfast outside the hotel. This place was referred by another restaurant down the street that didn't provide breakfast. Lively place with music, and an active vibe. The service was excellent. Sitting at the counter may have had something to do with that, but nonetheless it was great. The food was hot, tasted good and quickly prepared. I had the Belgium waffle fruit on top with a side of thick sliced bacon."
4 star rating,"SO SO SO good. Came here for brunch and it was really great. We came on a week day so we were sat right away, I'd expect a wait for weekends though. I ordered the Duck Bop Hash and it was absolutely incredible. It was probably one of the best breakfast dishes I've ever had!! Service, and atmosphere were great as well. The only downside to our experience was that we were informed after we ordered our food that the building was going to have a fire drill and that we would have to evacuate for 45 minutes. The server asked us if we wanted to cancel our order and when we told him that we did our food was already up. So we had to scarf everything down super fast which was a little annoying.... other than that, everything was great!!"
4.5 star rating,"Stopped in while in Detroit on business, and now it's secured that I will come here for my remaining breakfasts on this trip. I had the Gobbler Benny (a special) and my partner had the Salmon Benny. The Gobbler Benny was awesome, considering I was in the mood for what was in it. The turkey sausage was just slightly over seasoned, and the cranberry sauce could have been lessened because it was overwhelming. But those are the nitpicks. The eggs were perfectly poached, the stuffing cake perfectly moist, and the hollandaise was top. I also had a chai latte that was a bit muted in flavor(too much milk) but overall it was warming.The service was a little slow here but it's to be expected. The volume of people coming in right at opening was crazy, and by 8:30am it was half full. Definitely get here early if you want to get in quick!"
5 star rating,"We were looking for breakfast or brunch options within walking distance of our hotel. Per yelp, we decided on Dime Store. This place is nothing like a store and very popular as well as busy! We had a 45 minute wait before being seated. The hostess was very nice so we didn't mind. Besides, I just had to see what the hype was about.  I was starving and didn't want to spend much time scouring the menu that I settled on the Belgium waffle, scrambled eggs with cheese and their house-made pork sausage. My friend settled on build your own omelette and potatoes. The waffle was lukewarm but tasty once I slathered it in their delicious syrup. It tasted like yummy cane syrup. My eggs were scrambled perfectly with the right amount of cheese. The sausage however I sent right back to the kitchen and replaced it with bacon. Something wasn't quite right with that sausage. My friend enjoyed her omelette but the potatoes not so much. Oh I forgot to mention the peach mimosa I ordered was delicious and refreshing. The service was great. I'd visit again if I happen to be in downtown Detroit again as long as there isn't a wait."
4 star rating,Went there for lunch - get their early otherwise the line goes out the door. It's a small place so seating can be tight. Food is worth it...I got the special which was corned beef and hash. Highly recommended!Go for the salad(s) with Salmon my co-worker got that it looked great.
4 star rating,"I am working in Sterling Heights and my brother in law is working in Dearborn. We had to find common ground. This was a great place to find that. Park in the building garage and they will validate! Our server was great, honestly. No frills and straight forward. I got the BLTE breakfast sandwich. It surprisingly comes with a side salad, which I thought was odd. I am happy it did though. Leafy greens and a lemony dressing. Perfect starter. The sandwich was good, as well. Dearborn Bacon was thick and the brioche was super soft. My BIL accidentally left his food, and as we were heading to the elevator, our server runs out with his food."
4 star rating,"I came here with my fiancé and buddy before a baseball game and was very satisfied with my meal and the service. It's inside of a building with a couple of businesses and you have to put in a reservation and can sit at one of the chairs or tables while you wait.Upon entering the place it can get a bit crowded; we were seated 4 people and I could definitely hear other tables conversations without trying. We sat down and our waiter was awesome when it came to his recommendations and getting us drinks on time. I started with an Irish Coffee (may as well pregame before a baseball game right?) and went with the duck Reuben. My girl got the BLTE and it was also delicious. My buddy's wife got a bulgoki sandwich and it was so good that that is what I'll be ordering next time I come back here. The French fries were also good.Good location, but can be a long wait; but overall worth it to check out as a good brunch spot."
4 star rating,Worth the hour and half wait! At least you can wait in a seated area in the Chrysler building's lobby.  The staff was very sweet and came over to us apologizing about the late being longer than stated. It was a nice for them to acknowledge it and come by. The vegetarian hash was the best I've had. Love the potato cubes. The bloody Mary's were great. Will definitely come back here. Bring a game to pass the time
5 star rating,"Amazingly good breakfast to be found in the heart of downtown Detroit.  Very small, need to have your party all together to be seated, and it felt crowded. But considering how fabulous the hash was I totally understand why! Delicious artisan coffee, and a crazy variety of options for breakfast.  I'll have to go. Ack to try more! The service was prompt, but because of the fact that they are small and need move people quickly, I felt a bit rushed.  Still, very good food and adoreable atmosphere make this a place I would go to again!"
4 star rating,I visited after seeing Dime Store at Yelpdetroit on instagram that they are announced #1 restaurant in Detroit. I and my fiancé are from a small city so we just don't like driving around big cities because of parking situation. But Dime Store provides very convenient parking garage (Financial district garage) for 2 hours. We got there and of course there was wait but table turnover is very fast so we only waited 15 mins. I liked the ambience of the restaurant and the server came to my table fast and often. And.... the food was very good. My fiancé got cheesesteak sandwich and he wished it was bigger and I do agree it was smaller portion. But my food was very good. Thank you YelpDetroit for sharing your best restaurant. And Dime Store for making good food!
4 star rating,"My husband and I love this place. Usually we get one savory dish and one sweet, but at Dime Store my cheesesteak Benny is all mine. We've always had friendly service and food has always been delicious. Chai lattes are good too."
5 star rating,"Had lunch here a few days ago.  If my memory is right, companion had the special which had poached eggs on top of stuffing on top of turkey sausage sitting in cranberry sauce.  Said it was delicious, but one of the poached eggs was a little undercooked (the white part).I went with a mushroom omelette, potatoes sans seasoning, multigrain bread, and a side of turkey sausage.  Delicious.4.5 stars, but rounding down for the egg.Not my first trip and won't be my last."
4.5 star rating,"Had a great experience at the dime store. Went on a Saturday morning around 10:30 and was seated very quickly. I loved their menu selections, there were multiple options that I wanted to try.....not to mention that everything that came out looked delicious. The food was fresh, flavorful and reasonably priced.I ordered a create your own omelette and the French toast. Both were really good but my French toast was lukewarm at best. Aside from that everything we ate was great. I really enjoyed the hashborwn as they were cooked perfectly (so many people fail here )Overall we had a great visit and will definitely be back again.I knocked down a star for the service (our waiter didn't refill waters, or coffee. We had to get up to grab our on salt and pepper) and also because our French toast was not fresh. I'd imagine the next visit could easily be 5star"
4 star rating,"I have been trying to get into Dime Store since the day they opened but every single time I'm here, they are packed with at least a 45 minute wait.Well today I was downtown at 3pm, kind of an off hour as Dime Store closes at 4pm. They were about 25% full with lots of open seats!! Today was my day!!I ordered Bacon Avocado Omelette, Rye Toast and they allowed a substitution of the best damn fruit bowl I've ever had at a restaurant in place of the potatoes. The omelette was outstanding, and the rye toast was fabulous too as it was served with homemade jam.Tom ordered Maple Honey Salmon Salad. He said he loved it! Just looking at it made me want to get it! The salmon looked amazing!!We love the ambiance, the decor and the music too! Can't wait to go back!"
5 star rating,"I went here with a friend on Sunday morning and wasn't disappointed. You're immediately welcomed by a cool atmosphere, (including the neon sign people talk about), and a courteous, energetic staff.We each started out with an Irish coffee, which was generously poured, which is to say it was great. It's served separate from the coffee, so that allows you to choose how to ration the two components. It's a true Irish coffee: it has whiskey in addition to a cream-based liqueur. I had two.For our first course we split the waffles and the French toast. I preferred the latter but both were good. The brioche used for the French toast has a slight crisp to the crust, and a mild sweetness that you can taste before adding any syrup. We both still drowned each plate in butter and syrup, though, just to be safe.We couldn't decide which of the eggs bennys to get, so we ended up ordering all three and sharing. This isn't a bad way to go for two people, because each order has two portioned halves. We couldn't decide if we liked the pork belly or cheese steak variety best, but both were good. I docked a star from this place, though, because the eggs on two out of three benny orders were cooked through, meaning they were overcooked. It didn't detract in a disastrous way, but I missed the running yolk. But notwithstanding that, they were all tasty and pretty, and the side salad that comes with them is simple yet elegant too.Our server was Christina and she was very nice and attentive. All of the staff seemed pretty laid back and happy to be working there, it was a positive environment. I think that I prefer Hudson Cafe in terms of breakfast places downtown, simply because their French toast blew my mind, but I will still definitely return to Dime Store."
4 star rating,This is my best place to eat brunch  the salmon benny is my fav!!!!! thanks Larry!!!!!! I have fantastic time every time i come in.
5 star rating,"The food at Dime Store is awesome - love this menu.I'm also a huge fan of the atmosphere and decor - it's a fun place for anyone looking for a good start to your day!One thing I wasn't a fan of is how tight the space is. Our table was inches away from the next table, and unless I'm purposely going to a restaurant with community tables (i.e. Gather, Frita Batidos) I typically expect to not be sitting on top of each other. It's also really popular for lunch, so beware of a wait! That being said, I'll definitely return again... still so many things on the menu I want to try!"
4 star rating,"I'm a foodie and I have tons of experience in eating (LOL). Just moved here from DC and we visited this place about a couple of months ago when looking for a place to stay. The food and service was impeccable so we were excited that we were going to live only a block away'ish from this place. We went back again and man...their food is just.very.yummy. It's super casual yet the food doesn't look or taste casual. It's super fresh and nicely put together. Man, what's up with that spicy Korean fries?!?! What?! Although it wasn't spicy at all to me, it was a nice blend of Korean bulgogi with some thousand island dressing-like sauce on top of yummy fries. It was delicioso!! I love this place! You can't make reservations so sometimes, you will have to wait for a long time. The place is small so I understand. We were there before 9am on Sunday so there wasn't any wait. However! After 9 seems to be when it starts to get much busier. My plan is to taste every single dish from this place. #foodiegoals May be it's not such a great thing that I live so close to the place! Thank God I love to workout too!!"
5 star rating,"This place definitely gets crowded for lunch during the week. If you're heading there for a lunch break during the workday I'd head there by 11:30 to avoid waiting- the place isn't very big. The place is always busy for brunch on the weekends too. It's a little pricey, but the food and service is always good. I usually get the salmon burger because I love lox."
5 star rating,Waiting time  is long and they do not have online reservations. Food is really good! Next Best brunch place in Detroit after Hudson Cafe .
4 star rating,"This is a great place for breakfast.  Freshly prepared and chef inspired cuisine for breakfast? I'm down. I have tried a several things which were all tasty. However, the most memorable item I have eaten was the bacon.  No kidding.  Thick cut and meaty Dearborn bacon.  Not some BS bacon layered with fat.  They can get pretty busy. I have always waited for a table. However, the wait is not usually more than 15 minutes.  There is tons of available parking if you know where to look.  Just go to the West side blocks off Woodward."
4 star rating,"Came here due to the ""hype"" and all the rave reviews. It was honestly SUCH a let down. To begin with, right as we sat down, we got an attitude from our server. We were ordering and we felt very rushed, as we ordered and were not given a chance to finish ordering. I understand this place is busy, but at the least, customers should not be rushed. We started off with hot chocolate and coffee. She never came to our table after dropping them there. They sat there the whole time, along with a container with sugar packets and container of creams (at a very, very tiny table, mind you). She never came by to clear anything out of our way. She brought our food out and squeezed the plates onto the table around all of the clutter. We simply and nicely asked if she can please remove the items, since there was not much room for our plates, at this point (which she should have done on her own). She responded ""um, okay"" and rolled her eyes. Although she was very rude, we still tipped her accordingly, out of respect. Food was not worth the hype, as well. Mac and cheese was roomtemperature (not warm and cheesy) not good (and I am a mac and cheese fanatic). The BLTE sandwich had absolutely no flavor, at all and barely any sauce - and you guessed it, when I asked for more, I got an attitude. Everything we ordered was very bland and flavorless. Even the breakfast potatoes! I felt like I was eating nothing. 1 star because the sausage hash was okay - was not filling or anything out of this world though and we noticed that the other servers/staff seemed nice (just not the one we ended up with). This place is overhyped and was not worth the hour drive or the $60 for a breakfast for two."
4.5 star rating,"1st.time here because of a Yelp recommendation. Ok place inside a office building. Very noisy food was good,first try it came out cold even after ordering ""The Special"" On a Saturday.After all good food great service if you want this type of location."
3 star rating,"This place never seizes to amaze me. I come here as often as I can and would drive past all the other spots to get to this one. Their specials menu is always in point and the staple meals are never not made right. I also love that this place sells beer and wine and also mimosas. You get the ultimate brunch package when visiting the dime store. If you go on the weekends, be prepared to wait a while before being seating if you come after 11 AM."
5 star rating,"Hands down one of the best brunch options in downtown Detroit. I've had the brunch here several times over the last few years, and the quality has not diminished. Be prepared to wait if you come at peak times because there are no call ahead reservations, but it's worth it."
5 star rating,"Handy tip :  Go at 2.30pm on a saturday. That's when their wait lines go away and you can get seated immediately! :)What we ate : I got the veggie hash with beets,sweet potato,potatoes and pumpkin squash. It was lightly flavored with some curry powder. Yummy with eggs. Portion size was quite big. Their jam was also great! My husband got the veggie burger. Patty was made out of barley. The whole burger was really soft and melted in the mouth. However, the patty did not have any special taste and was almost bland. Maybe we wont order this again. Great house cut fries and mayo. We are glad we tried it."
4 star rating,"This was my first time dining at this restaurant and I must say the food was absolutely delicious! I had an item that was on the specials menu the strawberry cheesecake waffle! I literally felt like I had a small Slice of Heaven! The mac and cheese with the brussel sprouts was also a winner! The waiter was lackluster,  but that did not take away my experience from the food! The Chrysler Building that the restaurant is located in is also a great spot for culture and architecture! I definitely plan on dining here again."
4 star rating,This place is incredible! Amazing salad sandwiches and fries. We were in town for a conference- came back two says in a row. Couldn't resist. Excellent food!
5 star rating,Interesting place very good service excellent foodWe've only ever had breakfast there but it's quite outstanding
4 star rating,"I went here with a friend for a lunch today. Very busy, very loud, and they pack in the customers so it's a little cramped. The service was good, our waitress was tentative and polite. The only thing is the reviews I've read hyped this place up. It's more or less a cool cafe or diner in the ""new"" downtown Detroit area.I had the cheesesteak eggs benny and she had the Duck Bop Hash. My food was ok but honestly nothing special. She enjoyed her food, maybe more than me. Overall it was cool but not worth the hassle of finding parking downtown nor to be in a cramped space."
3 star rating,"We spent a weekend in downtown Detroit and chose the Dime Store for our breakfast spot.  It is a quaint, fun little restaurant inside the Chrysler House building. The coffee is from Zingermans.  We had the bacon avocado omelette, the spicy belly benny (the jalapeño pesto is excellent on the benny), and house fries -which if you love truffle, were excellent. The only minor complaint, is the mimosa was heavy on the OJ. We can't wait to go back!"
5 star rating,"This is a must stop! We came in a rush before the Lions game, the food was delicious, healthy, and fast!"
4.5 star rating,Omg. That's all I can say. Amazing food. Outstanding experience. Was waiting 45 min for a table but it was worth it. Great service too
5 star rating,"Went for lunch today. It was pretty crowded, which I took as a good sign in Downtown Detroit on a Sunday.  I ordered the Spicy Korean fries, cauliflower Gruyere soup and their ""simple"" salad. The fries are out of sight!! I ordered the small...wish I'd gotten a large. The soup was a little bland for my taste. The name of the salad explains the salad. Note: there are other salads that sound much more flavorful. The menu is full of interesting sounding dishes...from pork belly to Korean beef sandwiches.I'll would definitely return."
4 star rating,"Sad you can't make reservations online, Yelp, etc. but this place is definitely worth the wait and hype. If I'm ever back in Detroit, I'm for sure making a stop here!  Shared everything with the spouse and we couldn't decide what to eat because everything in the pictures on Yelp looked so good!  Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs but it was sooo worth it!"
5 star rating,"Dime Store consistently delivers interesting and delicious food. From traditional scrambled eggs and toast to variations of eggs Benedict, it brings diner cuisine to a gourmet level. Today's breakfast included eggnog French toast and pork belly jalapeño eggs Benedict. The French toast came with a ruminfused sauce and the spice was bold in the eggs Benedict."
5 star rating,"Just finished a 3 day trip to Detroit, 2 out of the 3 mornings we chose Dime Store for breakfast. You always know you are going to get great food here. We really enjoy sitting at the bar, love watching the process of the kitchen staff!"
5 star rating,"I had the duck bop hash, featuring duck confit, bulgogi, pickled vegetables, and sriracha... and boy, it was sooooo good!   A cool as hell vibe with really nice service. But I have to be honest...I disliked the coffee"
4 star rating,"The only reason I'm docking a star is because the counter space is cramped and someone had the bright idea to sit an older woman with a cane there and not offer her another option. The food was great! My husband and I shared a 1/2 order of the Korean fries. I built my own omelette and got the Belgium waffle. It was a hungry type of morning. Our waitress was great, despite being really busy. My omelette was too cheesy for my liking, but I could have ordered it with less cheese, luckily we had so much other food I left full.This place gets packed around noon, so come earlier if you can."
4 star rating,"Tiny cute and busy, awesome atmosphere . Next time I'll order something more extravagant, I only had some slam dunk good French toast and a bowl of fresh fruit. The Mimosa was a bit off but the bar had plenty other great choices. Great brunch...I'd definitely go back again *Super attentive service! Loved that about this spot"
4 star rating,Have only been once for breakfast. Good portions and great service.  Will have to go back to post a better review.
5 star rating,Definitely worth the wait! Went here for a Friday Lunch and there was a 35min wait for the little place. The place was definitely jammin' with all the nearby workers. They have lunch/brunch specials so look to the board to the daily special. The hostess was amazing and was able to accommodate our group of 4 that turned out to be 6 last minute -so def kudos to her for making it work! She was so polite and hardworking -truly amazing.Now onto the food: Locally sourced so you are supporting the city :) Menu looks simple but the tastes were amazing. I had the korean BBQ sandwich and bacon fries: Nice charred taste with the korean sweet bbq and the fries will satisfy your salt craving. Fries were not greasy or fatty tasting. The added Parmesan was perfect part to satisfy cheese craving. Bacon was thick cut so best to eat with forks. The Pork burger was prob the best part if you like spicy -looks fresh -tasted fresh as if they had marinated and mixed the meat patty just then and there as the spices all melted in  your mouth. It wasn't overly done so it was still juicy and  packs a kick once you start chewing! Went with a group to try everything between us. Def great to go with a small group or off hours with a big group cause the food was amazing. Parking is metered in the street or across the street in a structure. We lucked out with street parking.
4.5 star rating,"Korean bbq sandwich was okay would be a lot better if it was spicy, Brussels sprouts were really good, and fries were great as well"
4 star rating,Wow!  Dime store did not disappoint... Everything about our experience was great!  Service was friendly and efficient!  I had the Spicy Belly Benny and a side of breakfast potatoes... loved every bite and would highly recommend the Dime Store!  Can't wait to go back and try something else from their delicious menu!
5 star rating,Host said that wait time was 30 mins... ended up waiting for an hour! Food was worth it tho.
4 star rating,Best breakfast in Detroit.. hands down.  The duck bop hash is the jam.   Mimosas also aMazing!!
5 star rating,"Great atmosphere and awesome food. To be honest, the menu looked pretty typical for a brunch-like place, consisting of salads, sandwiches, eggs, French toast, fries, etc. But, wow! All of it was delicious. The fries with special mayos were out of this world. The French toast was done just right. My omelette was perfection. Worth the wait! A must eat place."
5 star rating,"One of my favorite brunch places in downtown. Although the wait to be seated took awhile, the service and food make up for it. The atmosphere is both high end and casual and the price isn't too bad. I had the duck bap and was pleasantly surprised at how well seasoned the potatoes were. The bulgogi fries were also a delicious treat. Although, I was a bit disappointed with the peach mimosa as it really just tasted like a regular mimosa. Either way, definitely recommend to brunch lovers in/visiting  Detroit."
4 star rating,"Yum, yum, yum!!  The bacon avocado omelette was perfection!!  The Brioche French toast was the perfect sweetness to go with our savory omelette.  I noticed a neighboring table enjoying a side salad and couldn't resist adding that to our order.  It tasted as fresh as it looked!!  The potatoes were addicting, although we were both nervous to try them because they didn't look super-appetizing.  But...there was almost nothing left on our plates!!The coffee was hot and delicious.  The mimosa was refreshing.We waited about 45 minutes for Sunday brunch.  We didn't mind sipping coffee in the large lobby area of the building.  There was plenty of seating, and sunshine coming through all of the windows.All of the servers seemed friendly.  Our server was attentive and polite.  The only negative part of our visit was that the host was not very friendly.  We never saw her smile, and her attitude made it clear that she did not want to be there.I will definitely be back!!  There were a lot of menu items that caught my eye.  I may have to stop in for lunch later this week!!"
4 star rating,"Cute little place that gets very busy for weekend brunch and weekday lunches! Be prepared to sit very close to another table if only 2 people in your party. Food is good and the menu is a decent size. First impression service wasn't great, but that won't deter me from visiting again. Server may have just been having an off day."
4 star rating,"Such a great way to start out the weekend.  Had the waffles with plum compote and lemon drizzle, topped with almonds, I think it was a special, it was absolutely delicious.  Husband and I shared the Philly cheesesteak benny was which also really good.  Although I was concerned that this would be overly salty, it was perfectly seasoned, and served w/ crispy potatoes.  The meal was filling but not heavy.  Got a latte, which was good.  Service was attentive and friendly.  The only thing is that the place is REALLY loud, especially on a weekend morning.  I probably wouldn't try to go with a group any larger than 4, 6 at the max. Great experience overall!"
5 star rating,What an experience. When you go to breakfast you expect a relaxed atmosphere typically accompanied by a lackadaisical wait staff. We arrived and given a 25 minute wait but were able to sit down within 10. Our waiter got to us within minutes after our host brought us our drinks. I had the spicy belly eggs Benedict while my wife had the cold cut salmon sandwich. We were both surprised by the prices. Nothing on the menu was more than $15 and the serving sizes of these portions will leave you stuffed and satisfied. Our meals were cooked right in front of us and we watched as our eggs were fired fresh within 2 minutes of the order being out. We received our meals within 15 minutes and began our feast. What a delight. I have never had eggs Benedict so fluffy and the addition of fried pork belly really escalated the dish to the next level. I will definitely be coming back to Detroit to have this wonderful breakfast experience again!
4.5 star rating,"Dime store, always a special treat. They usually are serving up something fresh and new on the menu."
5 star rating,"This place came highly recommended from locals while I was in town for a conference, and I'm so glad I came by! I sat at the bar, and got excellent service. Ordered the Duck Bop, which was the perfect mix of sweet and savory. The ambiance has a very hipster vibe, which I loved. Will definitely be back whenever in Detroit!"
5 star rating,"Yummy  the food was really good. Service was top-notch today and we had an lovely omelettes, duck hash, salad and salmon. What could possibly be better?Recommend this restaurant. Great flavors. Start with the Pork Rines."
5 star rating,Seating was quick even though it was packed.  Food was great and service was amazing as well
5 star rating,"Pretty long wait on a Saturday - about an hour.  Quality of the food was decent, but they forgot to bring out certain sides until well into our meal. Everyone's toast and English muffin was overtoasted and hard as a rock.  Prices were fair and coffee was good and strong.  Not really sure why half the menu items need bulgogi in them??"
3 star rating,"We got a hotel downtown Detroit and I found this place through Yelp. Since this was our first time visiting Detroit, we didn't have any idea how dangerous it would be to walk around downtown early in the Sunday Morning. But this place seemed bright and nice, so we decided to give it a try. I had the Pork Belly Benedict and it was the best Benedict I've had so far.It had basil sauce in it and it gave great depth of flavor to the Benedict. The atmosphere was great and this place made us forget that we were in Detroit."
4 star rating,Great place and atmosphere.  The food is really good with reasonable pricing.  Awesome location we walked in before a concert we were able to eat and walk on over to casino after.  There are a ton of new restaurants downtown but I would give this place a try.
4 star rating,"Had a fantastic lunch year after walking all around downtown Detroit. I love that they let you get any sandwich you want but made as a salad. Great for a midday meal. The mac & cheese is a must. Be sure to get some Sriacha to add to the mac & cheese if you like! Great atmosphere, great buzz. Great location."
5 star rating,Excellent food and service. Came here from out of town for brunch. I got the sausage hash.
5 star rating,"I came once before and got the duck bop and loved it.  So I brought my boyfriend and a friend here for brunch and we basically ordered everything off the chef's special menu, all the Game of Thrones items.  I got the braavos Benny which was delicious, I like that it wasn't serve on an English muffin or some other type of carb, just the crab cake.  My boyfriend got the red wedding hash and pretty much licked the plate clean.  Our friend ordered the mother of dragon omelette and really enjoyed it.  We all split the white walker French toast and the spicy Korean fries.  The fries had a great mix of salty, spicy and vinegar from the Kim chi, awesome!  Yes, all that food was for 3 people, welcome to brunching with us :)"
4.5 star rating,"Wow!!  Why can't Dime Store be located in Baltimore, MD?  Our daycation started at the Dime Store, with two drinks and a half order of the spicy Korean fries (killerrrr!).  This stop set the perfect tone for our Detroit bar crawl.  Great service, friendly atmosphere and kickass food...If you're an outta towner, sit at the bar and chat it up with Big Mike.  He knows any and everyone when it comes to the Detroit scene..."
5 star rating,I love the Dime Store! I go there at least once a week. They have awesome breakfast/brunch or lunch options. I work in Detroit and they are next door to me. Awesome service and friendly staff!
4 star rating,"This place popped up on Yelp as the first option and it did not disappoint food wise. I had the biscuits and gravy with these thick, yummy bacon bits on top and the bf had the salmon eggs benedict; both dishes were to die  for! The only reason I'm giving four stars is because it was incredibly packed and we had to sit at the bar right by the entrance to the kitchen, so we were constantly being bumped by the staff and one person broke a glass right next to me and splashed water on my clothes.  Other than that, staff was friendly and helpful. Highly recommend if you can avoid sitting at the bar near the kitchen."
4 star rating,"Really nice place! Customer Service was excellent! Ordered the spicy Korean fries, corn beef hash & bacon apple waffles. All taste pretty good! I am really sad that I didn't get the large size of the fries, I'm craving them now!!"
4 star rating,"Fun ""diner"" with a nice vibe that is freaking impossible to get into at night.  Literally.  There was not an unlocked door to the building, and when we rang security, they just kept saying ""security"" and didn't hear that we kept asking to be let in so we could go to the restaurants.  Finally a lady came out and we quickly grabbed the door and scuttled in.  The place was nearly empty on Tuesday night (maybe because other people didn't try so hard to get in?)Once we made it in, things got better.  We ordered a few sides to share and each got an entree.  Items ordered were the mac & cheese, spicy korean fries, pork burger,  brussels sprouts, duck bop hash, and pblt.  I didn't try either of the latter three but did sample the first three.  My coworkers liked the hash and the pblt.  It was said though that the english muffin and the jam were wasted on the duck bop hash because the korean sauce overpowered the jam.  My pork burger was pretty good and an interesting flavor combination.  The mac & cheese was good, though I think it needed a touch of a slightly sharper cheese to make it really stand out.  I enjoyed the Korean fries but would have preferred more Sriracha mayo and beef and less of the BBQ marinade in the bottom.I will admit that I think I would have been even happier with our meal if I hadn't just eaten at Wright & Co the day before which featured some very similar items (pork belly sliders, brussells sprouts salad, pasta w/ gorgonzola etc.) and was just beyond the bell curve amazing so very hard to live up to.  Regardless, Dime Store is a great restaurant that's definitely worth a visit."
4 star rating,"If I could give this restaurant 6 stars, I would. I'm obsessed with their brunch menu. I always get the Pork Belly Benny and my boyfriend gets the Sausage hash- however, every day their specials sound better than the next. They maintain consistency in the best way possible. If you sit at the bar, you'll most likely be helped by the most entertaining man who adds to the overall delightful experience. (If you know, you know). The wait times can get long, but if you're starving you can get a smoothie from the little shawarma shop next door. It's worth the wait. Trust me"
5 star rating,"Let me start by saying that truly great servers are hard to find, but Lauren was awesome. When staying downtown,  the best breakfast is at Dime Store!!.   Hash in variety, quick service, trendy atmosphere, & great location - walking distance from the hart plaza. DOUBLE BONUS:Cappuccino with almond milk was AWESOME!Is hard to find a barista capable of switching to almond milk, of course the beans play a role too."
5 star rating,"A lot of brunch spots are laughably crowded and look more like a line at the Secretary of State rather than a restaurant, as folks wait an hour just to order some overpriced eggs and a watered down mimosa.This is not one of those places.Two things make this the best brunch spot I've visited. First, waiting 45 minutes for a table isn't really a wait at all, because you can grab a coffee from the counter and post up in the lobby, sitting at a table or couch, browsing their menu and chatting with friends. Well lit, comfortable seating, and chill af. I almost wasn't ready to enter the restaurant when they called our name.Second, the food is very, very good. It's just delicious. The dishes meld and mash up different influences for something pretty special and interesting on each plate. If you're into something more classic, even the French toast is on point.I don't really need to go to another spot for brunch. I've found my home."
5 star rating,"Slightly tricky to find parking. There's paid street parking or paid lots in the area.  The restaurant is small, and the acoustics are terrible so it's not ideal for having a conversation.  The food was delicious. My man and I both ordered the hash - he ordered the FUEGO HASH which was a special for the day - and I ordered the DUCK HASH.  We both loved it.  The potatoes are nice and crispy, and it was very flavorful. If you like sweet and a little spicy, you would like the Duck Hash.  The only thing I'd do to improve the dish is to ease up on the sauce.  I didn't try the waffles but it looked good."
5 star rating,My breakfast was so good! Enjoyed it very much I recommend the bacon avocado omelette with fruit. Latte was really good too! If your in the downtown area in Detroit check out the dime store. You won't regret it! I didn't.
4.5 star rating,"Dime Store is an excellent choice for brunch in downtown Detroit. My parents and I loved our meal there. If you go on the weekend, you'll likely face a line, but our party only waited for about 35 minutes. Not terrible. The service here is superb, and the friendly waitstaff are more than happy to walk you through the menu and accommodate any substitutions. Dime Store has an extensive menu - it was hard to choose what to order! Their mac and cheese is delicious: creamy and savory, with panko crumbs to give it texture. We also loved the breakfast hashes, both the duck bop and the homemade sausage. The portions are generous, and the meats are well-seasoned and perfectly cooked. I also should note that Dime Store's homemade jams (for biscuits and muffins) are exceptional. They were so good, my mom even used it with the hash! Considering the service and the quality of the food, the prices are pretty reasonable, especially for a downtown restaurant. Dime Store, definitely 10/10!"
5 star rating,"Hmmm, worth a second chance but... I didn't love it here. I wanted to, but the breakfast burrito was too much meat and too little breakfast (eggs were miniscule in quantity). The bloody mary was too vinegary and service at the bar was speedy but not especially attentive (no water refill until the end of breakfast, drinks arriving with entree, no checking in to see how things are going, etc.). The tortilla soup was tasty and nicely balanced with chicken, corn, and other ingredients. There seems to be good energy about this spot so maybe I had an inconsistent experience, hence the second chance."
3 star rating,"Walking by we expected a long wait bc this relatively tiny spot was buuuuusy but we were able to get a table right away! Service was adequately friendly and very efficient, in and out pretty quickly. Food was ok, honestly nothing special. If you're a fan of hipstery restaurants then you'll likely enjoy it, just don't expect it to knock your socks off. If you take issue with loud restaurants (those with a trendy metal-wood motif, close tables, and lots of chatter) then this is probably not the spot for you.."
4 star rating,Excellent food and service. I had steak eggs Benedict.  Was excellent. Portions were good sized. prices are fair.
4 star rating,"Always a fan favorite - my favorite brunch spot in Detroit, never disappoints, I've had like 90 percent of the menu and all phenom. I'd recommend to anyone visiting or local"
5 star rating,"Came here for lunch during a convention downtown, this was very good. Ordered the Spicy Korean fries and Korean BBQ sandwich.  Very tasty, definitely coming back."
5 star rating,"The best breakfast you will ever have!  We were there for a convention and this was the place to go. Get there early, because there will be a wait, but well worth the wait!"
5 star rating,"Dime Store is the best sit down place for breakfast, period. Staff is friendly, service is fast, and food is always amazing. There is always a wait, which is worth it, and in my experience you usually wait for less than the time they quote you, and you aren't rushed once you're seated. This place is great!"
5 star rating,"Had lunch here. Great food. Say next to the kitchen area so I watched a bunch of dishes come out. Everything looked amazing. In the end, I settled on the Korean BBQ sandwich. Highly recommend."
5 star rating,Delicious! great service and nice atmosphere. I ordered the duck reuben and was pleased with it.
4.5 star rating,"You're searching for a brunch spot in Detroit? Yeah, you can get bogged down if you don't make a quick decision. Stop. You've found what you're looking for. Dime Store brings quality dishes in a quality manner. The menu is what sets this place apart from anywhere else. You want the best french toast? Here. You also want eggs Benedict that is eggs Benedict? Here. Everything is presented well, with top shelf ingredients. No B Squad here.Come early and expect to wait. Don't complain. Just wait and enjoy. Tip* ... Put you name in, walk over to Roasting Plant and get yourself a coffee. Chat about something and head back to hit your table on time. Be Efficient. B-E Efficient."
5 star rating,"Great spot for breakfast and lunch. Lot of unique and classic menu items. If you're ever stuck between breakfast and lunch, here's a tip that sounds strange at first but you will not regret trying it. Get the Korean fries and ask to have an egg or two on top. It is delightful."
5 star rating,Amazing food and service. Tried the brussel sprout salad and it was surprisingly warm and really really delicious
5 star rating,"Great breakfast! We had a pretty quick wait in the spacious lobby area. Great latte and delicious Korean Fries as an ""appetizer."" I tried the cheesesteak Benedict and my date had the sausage hash with a biscuit instead of an English muffin. The biscuit was soooo delicious. Everything else was too but the fries, latte, and biscuit were the highlights!"
5 star rating,"Have been here 4-5 times now in the past few months - AMAZING! The food is SO good, I have ordered different things each time, all fantastic. My favorite is the sausage hash/scramble thing, which is mouth watering. Awesome service, quick but not pushy, and while I have waited an hour for a table before, there is coffee while you wait AND a super gorgeous lobby to wait in makes the time fly!"
5 star rating,"The Dime Store has a long wait for Sunday brunch and it is well worth it and the waiting area at the building lobby is beautiful.  It is a cozy environment, the staff is quick and very pleasant, and you can't go wrong with the selection.  They have a few specialty selections for the day which you can check out along with the rest of the menu in a beautiful waiting area."
5 star rating,Came here for brunch before a Tigers game and we were not disappointed. The sausage hash tasted so delicious. The toast and jam were amazing! The coffee tasted fresh with every pour and the Irish coffee is a must (so strong !) . Would definitely recommend coming here
4 star rating,"Amazing food! Amazing staff! So friendly and kind ! Went there with my dumb ass ex and he complained about the food because bland but I tasted it and it was fine.. he just liked his food even more salty I guess. I told him could just pour more salt on the eggs so he did.  I forgot to take home my order of Mac and cheese (so good.) and I called up and asked to come back and I had my receipt,.. and i was taken care of!"
5 star rating,"Excellent staff, the food was killer, get the pork rinds! Our first stop every time we are in Detroit"
5 star rating,Amazing brunch place! Good size place and busy but wait safe is on their game. Whether you are grabbing a quick coffee or getting grub You will not be disappointed!
4.5 star rating,"An amazing surprise. Walking by it looks like any other food spot, but the food blew me out of the water. I had some pretty silent lunches there... I was busy shoveling food into my mouth.The duck hash is a must."
5 star rating,"Great service with a very nice, helpful staff. I ordered the sausage hash and it was incredible. One of the most flavorful dishes I've ever had the pleasure of eating. My girlfriend ordered the cheesesteak Benny and it was very good. Definitely order one of these two dishes. The bacon, parm truffle fries were amazing. Got the half size and it was a perfect amount for an appetizer. Highly recommend it. The bloody Mary's were well balanced. It had just enough spicy kick where it wasn't overwhelming. It also was not too much tomato juice where it drowned out the other flavors. Breakfast. Brunch. Booze"
5 star rating,"I had seen the reviews and I so wanted to love this place.  Almost all the pieces were there.  The restaurant has a very nice vibe with a huge window facing the street. My waitress was attentive and looked like Amy Winehouse.  They have interesting menu  with twists on classics.  And they were playing some good 80's R&B/Pop, most notably Jungle Love by Morris Day and Time.  This place seemed to be a magnet for hipsters.  There were about 10 people in the restaurant while I was there and every man there besides me, was sporting a healthy beard.I ordered the Duck Bop Hash and I was disappointed.  I am a Korean-American and I feel like it is my duty to support these kinds of a dishes.  I feel like our cuisine is often looked over, and have been glad to see it really becoming part of the mainstream.  This dish tries to mix the Korean staple Bibim Bop and but replaces the rice with potatoes.  I felt it had great potential but the execution killed the dish.  First, there was too much Korean BBQ glaze, which overpowered every other element.  More importantly, I felt the potatoes were extremely overcooked.  When I think of a hash, I think of potatoes with a light crust, but soft insides.  These potatoes were more like cubed potato chips.  That said the duck was great and pickled veggies were solid.  They also gave me an English muffin with a side of homemade orange pear jam.  The jam was another thing that sounded nice, but tasted like honey.  Overall, it might have been a bad batch potatoes or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but in this instance, I felt my meal fell flat.  That being said; I would try this place again, but I  would only do so if I happened to be in the area."
3 star rating,"Came here today around 2:15pm with my boyfriend and two friends. We didn't wait long to be seated, around 5 minutes. Service was great. A bit too crowded for my taste. Seated in an awkward arrangement near the window. I was really looking forward to this place, especially after having seen snapchats and various posts by friends. Unfortunately this place did not live up to the hype. I ordered the build-your-own omelette, as did my boyfriend, and we got an order of the brioche French toast and a beer-mosa. He enjoyed his omelette. Mine was made with egg whites and came out very watery. The potatoes were good. The beer-mosa was pretty good.The brioche French toast was a huge let down. I've had much better French toast at most mom-n-pop diners. It was very dry with very little flavor. We also got an order of the house fries. Not bad, but also not great.Friend 1 got the salad with salmon on it. She enjoyed it. Friend 2 got the eggs Benedict with turkey sausage and enjoyed it as well. Overall the food isn't horrible, just not WOW for the price you pay."
3 star rating,"Best brunch in Detroit. Hands down. Yes, it's always busy and the wait is long and hence I wish there was a lot more area for seating. Nonetheless, the service is impeccable.Order the fries (you won't go wrong with any kind), and the Duck Bop Hash. Sooooo good. Wash everything down with a beermosa and you're good to go!"
5 star rating,"Oh, my GOD!!! That is the absolute best hash I have ever had!!! If you find yourself near Campus Martius in Detroit, you HAVE TO check this place out! Try the ""housemade"" Sausage Hash, you won't be disappointed!!! The potatoes were fresh and crispy, as were the red and green bell peppers; the sausage was delicious; the crepa (not sure what that is) and spicy ketchup were a perfect touch; the over easy eggs were perfectly cooked  It came with an English muffin and what tasted like apricot preserves I highly recommend this place!!!The Dimestore is so awesome that I'm reposting my previous review  I just had the Sausage Hash, again, for breakfast and it's even better than I remembered!!! Check it out and enjoy"

5 star rating,"This is a great spot for lunch or brunch, though it can get a bit crowded on the weekends. For breakfast I'd recommend the omelet which is super fluffy and huge. For lunch, the salads are great, so is the Korean sandwich or the Mac and cheese. Servers are pleasant and not at all the annoying hostile-hipster type found in a lot of the new eateries that have popped up in recent years. Overall this is a friendly, cheerful place to eat with great, fast service."
5 star rating,Really really delicious food! Came here for a weekend and saw the ratings and we had to try! Long wait but totally worth it!! The Korean spicy fries were mouth watering and their brunch menus; gumbo and the dirty hash were awesome!! Will definitely stop by next time we are here!!
5 star rating,"You need a dime that's top of the line?After this brunch, I'm all over that ""big behind"" part, but you're on your own for the ""slim waist."" And depending on whether or not you think having spicy Korean fry sauce all over your face is ""cute,"" I might be your girl.So ""top of the line"" might be a little bit of a generous description for Dime Store, but overall it's a solid brunch destination within walking distance of the Detroit River, where you can gaze longingly at Canada as you make your plans to move there after this election is over. Oh heeeeey Justin Trudeau.Definitely gets:Spicy Korean Fries - so you too can have a ""cute face.""Duck Bop Hash - this is obviously what Hanson was singing about circa 1997.Duck Reuben - Sensing a theme? The duck days of summer?Maybe gets:Seared Brussel Sprouts Salad - don't asked me why I f'ed with a salad with the rest of the deliciousness on the menu.Probably skips:Watermelon Gazpacho soup (special) - Eh. Watermelon is just best when injected with vodka. End of story.Also I'm not sure about the staff here. They're this weird combination of ""Hey let's be friends!"" and ""Wait, did you spit in my food?"" But what can I say, ""Everywhere I go I'm tryin' to find a badd..."""
4 star rating,"All the food looks fantastic and my pork belly beny was delicious, but that sriracha, truffle oil, and eel sauce pork rinds are must!"
4.5 star rating,"Nothing makes my foodie spirit happier than when a highly rated restaurant on Yelp lives up to the hype. This review is for those folks like myself, visiting Detroit for business and want an amazing spot to grab breakfast minus the upscale stuffiness. Dime Store is tucked away inside the Chrysler House building. Do not judge Dime Store by its appearance. Yes, it looks like a diner that forgot we're now in the 21st century. Yes, for some it may be on the small side. Yes, you may be startled by the extremely nice security guard who says hello to literally everyone walking into the building, blessing everyone with levels of genuine friendliness most of us won't see the entire day from coworkers. But when that food arrives at your table, you'll forgot all about these other non-factors. Our table split the cheesesteak and spicy belly Benny's. These are the most amazing spins on the traditional eggs Benedict that I've ever tasted. I hate hyperbole, and yet this place pulls it out of me. The seasonal french toast was strawberry shortcake, or some version of it (pause). I'm sorry but I had to capture in text how I was was lost in thought remembering these dishes. If you're looking for a fancy, upscale restaurant with cloth napkins, Dime Store is not your establishment. But if you're looking for a food experience that will have you leaving town counting down the days until your next trip back to Detroit, Dime Store will not disappoint.FYI: It's worth dining in. The to go menu is vastly limited compared to the dine in menu."
5 star rating,"Unique, interesting, fun menu! Something for everyone. I went once but only spent about 25 minutes, grabbing a quick breakfast of the salmon benny (delicious!). Recently I had more time to sit down with a friend and we headed over to Dime Store. We were quoted a wait time of 35-40 minutes which seemed fine, since the lobby was crowded. We were sat within 15 minutes, at a lovely table by the window no less! I got the caramel apple french toast, which looked so delicious that the man at the next table asked what I had ordered and ordered it as well. It tasted just as good as it looked! I devoured the whole thing. My friend got a vegetarian burger and said he wished they sold the patties frozen--it was that good! The drinks go from basic to inventive. I got the peach mimosa--hard to beat a classic. My friend got a ""breakfast old fashioned"". I'm a cold brew fan, and an old fashioned fan, but this was a little bitter for my tastes. He, however, was over the moon.All in all, a fantastic place for brunch. A little on the pricey side, but I was prepared for that, given the quality of food. Be prepared also to wait a little while--it's a small, intimate space and can only seat so many. Worth it in my opinion!"
5 star rating,"Good food, fast service, fresh food. Loud but that's typical for a busy brunch spot!  Menu offers more variety than the typical breakfast spot. Really enjoyed the sausage hash!  Would recommend for sure. Doubt I'll be back in Detroit again but would go back if I was!"
5 star rating,"On a morning like today, I definitely needed a coffee. We sat down quickly and ordered coffees and food immediately (after previewing the menu online on our way). Then everyone around us got coffees. Then refills. 15 minutes later, our coffee arrived.  I ordered the sausage hash. It would be a stretch to say it was warm when it finally arrived. There were only 3 little pieces of sausage hidden under the eggs. The crema and spicy ketchup did nothing.  I was expecting something special. It was no better, and much more expensive than the local coney. Our server never came back until we were done eating and we never got a refill on our $2.50 coffees."
2 star rating,"There is not one thing I could say negatively about this restaurant. The food is some of the best in the city, for sure. The service was fantastic.I had the french toast, and the duck reuben. Both were phenomenal. I'm excited to get back here in a few weeks when a friend comes to visit from NY."
5 star rating,"Awesome food, reasonably priced , good service, parking is validated.... what more can you want for a restaurant. Korean fries are delicious , the Brussel sprout appetizer was soon good. My poached pear salad with grilled chicken for ($10 plus $4 for adding the chicken) was a salad to remember. My friend really liked her omelette breakfast too. This restaurant with a small but well thought planned menu (which includes breakfast food to gumbo, from different salads to Korean spiced fries with bacon on top)serves breakfast and branch all day 8 am -8 pm. Visit them and you would be disappointed"
5 star rating,"The food is delicious and the service is great. I would highly recommend a visit. I thought it would be a long wait, however we were seated promptly. If we had to wait, it would be worth every minute."
5 star rating,Great coffee! Amazing omelette! Hash browns were different but also good! Wonderful staff! Hope to come back some day!
5 star rating,Nice place - right downtown and good brunch selection. We were seated right away and enjoyed the food a lot. My wife said she didn't even need ketchup with the hash - it was so good (that's a huge compliment from her). We're not in Detroit a lot these days but would come back when we do.
4 star rating,"Just ate the not yo mama's hotcakes and they were amazing! Had to wait a bit to be seated, but it was definitely worth the wait.My friends ordered the make your own omelet and the french toast and both were very satisfied. It has a great atmosphere and is very clean!Definitely coming back the next time I'm in Detroit!"
4.5 star rating,"Had wanted to try this place for a while, after hearing such great things. Considering everything in Detroit is trendy now, I knew there would be a brunch wait and was fine with that. My party of 3 sat at the bar facing the kitchen. Not ideal but it was fine. Uncomfortable having to constantly turn around for the waitress, meaning constantly bumping into the person next to me, but a busy atmosphere must mean this place is doing something right. Right? Ordered a coffee and Bloody Mary to start things off. The coffee was good. The Bloody Mary was so incredibly average. For a brunch spot, I don't know but I expect a drink with some verve. Instead, a watery drink with a limp pickle. Meh. For my meal, I ordered an omelet with house fries. Both so underwhelming, that I don't even remember what the omelet had in it. The house fries are terrible. Bland, flavorless tiny pieces of potato. No seasoning, maybe throw an onion or two in there. Nothing. Just dry, tasteless nuggets. Came with one piece of toast cut in half, so it looked like two pieces of toast. LOL Weird. The rest of my party was overall okay with their orders. Both agreed though, wouldn't probably rush back. The atmosphere is very hipster-ish but not pretentious. I actually liked the hustle being seated by the open kitchen. Just wish the food wasn't so darn average. Better eats many other places. Better Bloody Mary's pretty much anywhere. Probably won't be back. If I do come back, it won't be because I'm paying.3 stars for ambiance and potential but this place has been around a while, maybe it's already reached it."
3 star rating,Thank goodness the parking around this spot is so hard otherwise I would go broke in this place. I finally made it to the Dime Store and wow it didn't disappoint. I had the french toast off the specials menu and hands down it was the best french toast I have ever had. I should have stopped eating before the last 4 bites but I just had to stuff it all in my belly leaving me overstuffed! My eating partner had the Gobbleberry Benny also off the special list and my eyes were wide open when it came. He kept saying how awesome it was so I assume it was yummy. Both dishes were beautiful on the plate. I had a window seat and it was a little drafty but I'm sure when it's not so cold out it would be a nice spot.
5 star rating,"Omg was this place worth the hour wait! Lauren was our server; beautiful, very friendly, and an A+ server. The spicy Korean fries (pictured, half order) were to die for."
5 star rating,Seating was quick even though it was packed.  Food was great and service was amazing as well
5 star rating,"Love this place! Great food, drinks, atmosphere, and service. Only down side is that this place is so good that there is usually a decent wait, but it's totally worth it!If you're looking for a fantastic brunch in a chill environment, Dime Store is your place!"
5 star rating,Definitely recommend if you are in the Detroit area. Food was beyond great. Get a hash plate if you are there for breakfast. You won't be disappointed! I would get sriracha instead of the spicy ketchup if I would do it again. I'll definitely be back.
5 star rating,"We stopped here before heading to Toronto and had a yummy Beer-mosa to fuel our trip! The food was yummy, a little pricey but worth it."
4 star rating,This is my officially my new favorite brunch spot. Everything was fabulous. I got the veggie omelette which was to die for along with the breakfast potatoes. The place is a bit crowded but you can still hear clearly what everyone at the table is saying. The atmosphere is very welcoming and upbeat. I will definitely return.
5 star rating,"Ok.. so I may receive flack for this but here goes.. Dimestore is SOOO worthy of a five star review. Why? Because the food is AMAZING... the service is STELLAR... the vibe is ON POINT.. and the location is THE BOMB; however, I am unable to rate this a five star at the present moment because of the following reasons: 1. During lunch hour a person can not be seated until all of the party is together. Huh?? Isn't that the point of being the first to be seated? TO SECURE SEATING INSTEAD OF WAITING?? 2. It is SUPER SMALL... the tables are smashed and I feel as though when a party is attempting to leave someone's big ass always bumps my drink, hand, or table.. not cool.. especially when manners are lacking! 3. I always leave smelling like I cooked the food myself. A mix between fast food joint and a smoking unkept stovetop with burning grease. Not cool when I have a super important meeting to attend afterwards.. The food is great, however, so if one is able to muster through my aforementioned nuances.. give them a try if you have not already :)"
4 star rating,"This place is just okay. Like other reviewers, I was excited to try this place because I've heard nothing but great things. I was underwhelmed. The food was just average. Another overhyped restaurant. I gave this place two chances and I was underwhelmed both times."
4.5 star rating,Sooooo gooooooood. Poached eggs from heaven. Busy and understandably so. This was a fantastic brunch!
5 star rating,"Came for a visit when we were in town overnight. My Bloody Mary was good, nothing too crazy. The Beermosas they serve are also good, never having had one before (they used a local brewed beer, you many have heard of it - Atwater - and it was also a decent price), and I would have to say both of our dishes were very tasty but I expected a bit more I guess after reading their menu. We both picked a dish that was on their chef features. The service was awesome and the atmosphere is very cool. I'm not giving it 5 stars because it was a bit steep in price (I mean 13-14.00 per meal is quite high as it was only some bread and eggs with corned beef hash, and I thought the food was good but nothing I will order again. We may have to go back and try an omelet or the eggs benny"
4 star rating,"HELLOOOO DETROIT!While it is unfortunate it took me as long as it did to try out Dime Store, I am so glad I finally did! The Duck Bop Hash and the Gobbler Benny are incredible. As much as I love brunch, it can get pretty repetitive pretty quickly. Truthfully, how many different spins can you possibly put on eggs, potatoes, and breakfast proteins. Apparently, quite a lot, to my own surprise! More on that later.The Dime Store dons a catchy, cursive hipster sign at the base of the Chrysler House building. It is every bit as hipster as it looks, and I love it. The line to get in at 1pm on a Sunday afternoon spilled into a generous waiting area in the lobby of the Chrysler House building equipped with comfy chairs, high top tables/stools, and cushioned benches. While we were quoted a 1 hour and 15 minute wait to get in for a party of 2, we got called in at 40 minutes. And boy were we glad we waited!The menu was varied yet not overwhelming. While there were multiple items I had wanted to try, we ultimately went with the Duck Bop Hash based on a number of good reviews on here and the Gobbler Benny because of my Thanksgiving spirit. The Duck Bop Hash did not disappoint with its delicious runny egg, flavorful duck confit, pickled vegetables, and gochujang-y sauce, atop a bed of potatoes. And the Gobbler Benny is by far the most creative rendition of an eggs benedict dish that I've ever seen, and delicious at that! Perfectly poached eggs on top of turkey sausage and pan fried stuffing in place of an English muffin, all sitting in a bath of cranberry sauce--twas most excellent. The vanilla latte was also quite out of this world. An all around success as far as brunching experience goes and I cannot wait to come back to try some of their other offerings."
5 star rating,"Solid breakfast food. Great menu, nice waitresses. A good pick for brunch in the area. Close to other Detroit things if you want to take a look at Campus Martius. Really liked the Duck Bop hash. The place is pretty small but we grabbed seats at the counter and were comfortable."
4 star rating,"The history of the Chrysler House building that Dime Store is in represents a nod to its past where the building was occupied by the Dime Savings Bank and you could open an account with only a dime. When you first enter Dime Store, it maintains Detroit's hip, grungy modern vibe with exposed brick as a tribute to industrial design. I had the Duck Bop Hash (~$12) which was absolutely delicious! Visiting from out of town LA, the price can't be beat and there was a generous portion of duck. When the waiter came out to serve me, I realized this dish was very Korean fusion brunch with english muffins, runny eggs, pickled veggies, and duck. The flavoring of the duck is drool-worthy, with a nice tang of spiciness and is extremely packed with taste! It also came with a side of jam which made it a great combo of spicy and sweet atop cubed potatoes. I would recommend all visitors to come try. Sadly, does not accept Apply Pay."
5 star rating,"The benny was good. Busy and cramped inside. Worth a try as the food is good, but service is slow and you will spend a full hour."
3 star rating,Two of us went to brunch before a Detroit Lions game and they were very busy. We had to wait about 45 min but it was totally worth it! The food and service was amazing!
5 star rating,They're the best food is great plus it's downtown Detroit  and a great view of the city in side the store is a industrial look and feel to it as y come in the lobby it takes yr breath away it's a beautiful site to see it's a must see
5 star rating,"If your looking for a filling delicious breakfast/lunch. This is a must try! At first the wait times might scare you so be prepared to hear 1hour + especially on the weekends, but it goes much quicker and its definitely worth the wait!! Food comes our quick hot and correct, I'm a picky eater they did not disappoint! One of my new favorite spots down town!"
5 star rating,"This is one situation where i'm going to have to disagree with Yelp...I came with high expectations because the reviews were so good, but definitely left a little disappointed. There was a little bit of a wait to be seated (15 min) which I expected but the seating was reAlly crowded. I dont like being able to bump elbows with the stranger next to me while i'm eating. My pork sausage was actually raw inside and the manager said  that sometimes it can be a little pink...it was RAW. I'm pretty sure that you can get really really sick from eating raw pork, so that was weird. They did bring me some more out which was still still slightly pink...I ate it anyway. Hopefully i'll be ok. It tasted really good. The french toast was pretty good....this might be miner to some ppl but the butter was cold and impossible to spread. The scrambled eggs were definitely better than average. Service was.....ok. All in all its an ok place that I probably wont come back to because there are better choices."
4.5 star rating,The space is a little tight. It the food was on point. My friends and I really enjoyed our meal! I had the Benny and it was delish!
4 star rating,"I love their food! Literally everything is amazing, I love their sauce for the egg benny! So yummy! But one thing was that it was so tight to sit in there but that don't matter as of now, because it is in downtown so it will be busy!"
5 star rating,Fabulous brunch! The Brussels sprouts were excellent and the bacon avocado omelet was awesome.
5 star rating,Unique breakfast fare...duck confit hash with hints of maple syrup topped with a nice compliment of pickled vegetables.  Smooth well flavored hollandaise topped a pork and biscuit stack with a crisp salad dressed lightly with an vinegar and oil dressing. Good coffee and chai tea to boot!!  We highly recommend the Dime Store.
5 star rating,"Went there after reading the rave reviews.  The Dime Store is not the best brunch in Detroit!  Toast wanna be.  Waffle was cold, omelet not desirable, potatoes average.  Mac and cheese was pitiful.  Crowded seating, small tables. Wish I went to Toast.  However, I will say the staff was friendly. The food will not bring me back."
1 star rating,"I'm not a fan of community seating. By community seating, I mean the type of seating where you sit at a table with other strangers. For example, my mom and I came here for brunch on a Sunday. After waiting an hour, the hostess sat us at a table that seated four. I had no issues whatsoever until ten minutes goes by and the hostess seats two people at our table. My mom and I were sitting there enjoying our orange juice and all of a sudden we are joined by two random people. This was especially awkward because my mom and I are private people. We didn't even feel comfortable having a conversation because the people next to us were sitting about six inches away from us. If you are fine with this, you'll probably enjoy this place. The food was OK. It was a small portion of food. I was still hungry when I left and I'm an average woman. Honestly, the community seating ruined the entire experience. I wouldn't recommend this place."
1 star rating,"It costed little over a Dime in the dime store.. ha ha.. Amazing food, Good vegetarian options (more like eggiterian for breakfast). Weekend street parking is free. Sunday morning Mother's Day breakfast. The place was Super busy. When we went there were at-least 20 ppl waiting. Luckily we were only 3, so we sat almost immediately. . The wait area is comfortable it's the lobby of that building with ample seating. The staff is super friendly and nice. Starting at the front door, the hostess. Who was helping ppl pleasantly even during this busy morning. So the food: The days special - cheese cake and strawberry waffle. - Wow!! Delicious but it's a sin, at least 1 million calories. Lol. It was delicious. I never imagined that combination. But surprisingly superb. We all loved it.  Veggie hash - very good, A bed of crispy cubed potato hash with some sauté veggies, amazing seasoning, topped with two eggs. And a side of biscuit. Perfect dish. Just how I like it. The biscuit was little dry through! Veggie omelet - awesome. Something special about the way they cook the cheese or the type of cheese. Makes the omelette super yummy. Again served with hash and toast. They serve zingerman coffee- I was not a huge fan. But i was ok. They replaced it for a capachino for my wife. They ambience is trendy downtownish. I liked the roman style sketches in the wall and the rustic industrial recycled style furnitures. Basically we loved the place. We will come here often."

5 star rating,"Absolutely best breakfast place i have ever been to. Amazing food, my personal favorite is the French toast with fruits."
5 star rating,"I loved this place! It was super packed and we had a little bit of a wait but it was worth it. Very small, you almost feel crammed. Service was friendly and attentive, really liked the waffle, flavorful and a crispy-ness. Oatmeal was good, big serving. Bacon and white cheddar omelette was really really good but I wasn't a fan of the breakfast potatoes. I'd go back!"
4 star rating,"It was a cold rainy Sunday in October.  Normally I wouldn't be downtown on a Sunday morning.  Or looking for food choices at this time of day.  But after running the 26.2 miles of the Free Press Marathon, the first thing I could think of after finishing was going on Yelp and looking for the best food that I could eat.  With all of that running, I knew that menus would open up for me.  Typically, I eat healthy.  Low carbs.  Not too heavy.  Not that day.Corned beef hash special with scrambled eggs on top.  Delicious.  And it was made with real corned beef, not the canned stuff.And also pork rinds!  These were great.  Warm and crunchy.And a beer to go with it.  They have a good selection of drinks to choose from.This location is a bit hard to find.  The entrance is inside an office building.  But, it's convenient since there's such a long wait - you can sit in the lobby and comfortablly wait for your table.A great place to have a nicer than diner experience.And as we ate, we looked out and runners were still finishing....  Felt nice to be sitting and eating a guilt free meal!"
4.5 star rating,"Most importantly, the food was amazing (albeit a little pricey for breakfast)! I had the Heavens Hollerin' Waffle for brunch the day that we went to celebrate my sister's birthday. It was on their specials menu, along with some other tasty hash scrambles that some other members of my party got. It was quite busy, and the wait was pretty substantial when we got there. The hostess came out and asked if the fifth member of our party had arrived yet. Apparently, in order to be sat we had to assure her that we would not linger but would order the fifth person's meal if she didn't arrive in a few minutes! I thought that was a little ridiculous; but I understand that they were busy and they didn't want someone to hold up the table (once she arrived we didn't hear any more about it and were not rushed).It was also a little cramped because of the small space and the number of people, but I actually found the environment to be quite charming!"
4 star rating,This is a refreshing brunch spot in the heart of Detroit.  The atmosphere is great the staff is friendly the only thing I don't like is the restroom is outside of the Resturant. The food is great you have to try the duck bop hash
5 star rating,Dime is such a quaint place to dine. I love it there because the food is flavorful and just enough to enjoy for brunch or lunch. The staff is superb and the prices are reasonable. Definitely a place to visit as a weekly spot to unwind from the day to wet your palette. The presentation is superb as well. You may have to wait but it is not because of the staff. Dime will become your to go to spot when coming down to the city. Trust me you won't be disappointed. Bon appetit!
5 star rating,"I consider myself lucky that I was traveling alone, and thus could snag a seat at the bar to dine and avoid the wait! The duck bop hash really hit the spot for brunch- sweet, light spice, and savory. The bartender was friendly and provided great service, making recommendations on some nearby spots to check out before I had to head to the airport and checking in on what I needed, but never intrusive."
5 star rating,"The quintessential modern brunch place. Great food, great service, great decor, all for a reasonable price. The Dime offer vegetarian and vegan options as well, and honestly, being from Maine where breakfast options aren't nearly as vast or great tasting, having great food for brunch that isn't ""mainstream"" is a welcome breath of fresh air. After only being here a few days, I wish I could stay to come here more often. If I return, I'm definitely giving this place another visit."
5 star rating,The best bacon an avocado omelet ever!!!  Lemonade was great!!!  It to sweet just right. Staff was nice and friendly
5 star rating,"The food was fine, but nothing to get excited about. The service was friendly, and the seats and indoor area are a little bit cramped. Nothing I ordered stood out, but it wasn't offensive either. The potatoes were seriously overcooked and dry, omelet was slightly overdone, and the bacon was decent. I wouldn't wait in line for this place, but it seems like brunch options are limited around here."
3 star rating,"Wonderful staff and great food. This place is busy, so get there early if you don't want to wait long. Everything we ordered was fantastic including the French toast which was off the chain!"
5 star rating,Easily my favorite brunch place in Detroit. Everything is ALWAYS delicious and reasonably priced. Be prepared for a lengthy wait if you're going on the weekend--worth it though!
5 star rating,Everything is incredible! Get here early on the weekends but it's definitely a must do in Detroit!
4.5 star rating,Exceptional breakfast. 10yo loved it! We were really impressed with the food AND the service. Best breakfast in Detroit.
5 star rating,"Love the food & friendly, cozy atmosphere!  The service is always great and food never disappoints."
5 star rating,Went for brunch with my wife.  Wait was about 40 minutes on a Sunday morning around 11. We each had bennies and an order of the Parmesan fries.  Hers was the Thanksgiving special one and I got the spicy belly.  Everything was incredible.  Can't wait for another opportunity to go!
5 star rating,Holy mother of god!!! This was the best food I've ever had the pleasure of consuming!  I can't stop reminiscing about the flavors in the duck bop hash. I've never felt the sensation of flavors translating into euphoric bliss until eating this dish. I now know what it's like to stare god in the face.  I never get emotional about stuff and I usually react to things calculated and logical but I shed a tear as I digested these majestic flavors as if I'm living life for the first time. This one meal has opened my eyes and changed the way I live and appreciate life.
5 star rating,Had the salmon eggs Benedict and loved it! It was the coffee that made me really happy.. A good strong cup of joe is really important to me. I would certainly return.
5 star rating,The only negative thing is it's a little small and they close too early lol turkey sausage breakfast sandwich & Truffle fries are my favorite!
5 star rating,"Awesome brunch and lunch place in downtown Detroit. I found Dime store on Yelp and very glad I did because the food is wonderful. If you come on the weekends, expect to have a 30-45 minute wait and also make sure to tell them if you want a table because they have counters in which they will seat smaller groups unless you inform them of your preferences. The coffee is from a company in Ann Arbor so relatively local. The food itself tastes great and the portions are just right. I tried the veggie omelette and french toast. To top it all off, the staff are very friendly and will make sure everything is to your liking. Definitely will be back. Keep up the good work!"
5 star rating,Great brunch.  We had to wait. But it was worth it.  I was impressed with the ambition of the chef. There was a duck hash with an Asian slaw and an egg. It was delicious even for this spoiled LA foodie.
5 star rating,Fantastic brunch place. Perfect for post hang out recovering. Savory or sweet there are plenty of options for all!
5 star rating,Coffee was. Food was amazing. Had hash with house made sausage. Excellent. Place has a great vibe. Quick service. Will come again!
4.5 star rating,Best brunch place in Detroit. Get the smoked salmon Benny or the sandwich. You won't regret it
5 star rating,"A little pricey, but super delicious for a special breakfast or lunch! The smoked salmon Benedict was fantastic and their coffee is very good! Will be back."
4 star rating,I would drive the 3 hours to Detroit another weekend to again eat at the dime store. We sat at the counter and loved watching the chefs in action. Great service. Food ticket time very reasonable. And YUM
5 star rating,"Being a vegetarian, I used to love their butternut squash sandwich.  They removed from the menu. Left with a tasteless veggie burger and a grilled cheese.  The grilled cheese is fine, not award winning.  Their truffle fries are great. But not enough to make me want to lunch there a lot.  Prices are high but it is downtown Detroit.  If you have to lunch downtown and you're a veggie eater, look elsewhere."
3 star rating,"I got takeout for lunch and was really impressed when the person that cashed me out opened every single container to review the order.  Such a simple step, but so great, as anyone that gets frequent take out knows.I ate the Korean bulgogi fries and they were pretty fantastic, something I would gladly go back for.  The pickled vegetables paired perfectly with the fries and shaved beef."
4 star rating,They give you a bazillion fries with truffle mayo and the Brussel srpot salad was amazinggg.
5 star rating,"This is a great place to visit but I would not recommend visiting if you have any pressing matters to attend to. Visiting during the work week at lunch time is not recommended as this place is on the smaller side and fills up very quickly with people who are on lunch break .The food has a very rustic nuance that I have only seen at a few other places, all of the ingredients have a very fresh taste. EACH item has has a very detailed and well-thought-out recipe that one can appreciate all the way down to the blackberry jam served on multigrain toast. You would think that you were at a casual fine dining restaurant based on the quality but you get to enjoy the quirky and hip atmosphere without the pretentious additives. Love this place and would recommend it to anyone"
4 star rating,"Dime Store has yet to let me down!!! Every time I have been there the food was amazing, I would make this my every weekend breakfast spot, but waits vary from 30mins to +1hr. Well worth the wait if you want a great meal. I rank this place to be in the Top 10 places to eat in downtown Detroit. What an asset!!! Great Job!!"
5 star rating,Loved this place!! The Bloody Mary with the pickle was LIFE!! I stepped into this place after a flight feeling sick and 2 bloody Mary's and the turkey sausage sandwich later I felt great.A must if your traveling and want some brunch.
5 star rating,"I was super excited to try this place because of the stellar reviews. Sadly, it was a huge disappointment. First, the Bloody Mary was too simple for a place that coins itself as the ""American Brunch Bar""; mix that resembled (or may have been) Zip Zap with a single pickle. I was willing to look past this--it's just a drink. Second, it took twenty minutes to get our food. I'd be fine with this if the place were packed (it wasn't) or if we ordered something other than a salad and a breakfast sandwich with french fries. Also, willing to forgive this if the food were awesome. Food: I got the tomato and avocado breakfast sandwich AKA I got a bun with avocado and tomato. There was a single tiny fried egg with an enormously thick brioche bun. no seasoning. no sauce. no flavor. Sad. My partner got the salmon salad. My partner stated her workplace which is a hospital makes a better salmon salad. She had the same complaints as I did: no flavor other than overwhelming vinegar (which I personally liked) and no evidence of ""maple glazed"" flavor as stated in the menu. Bummer."
4.5 star rating,"It's a hop, skip and jump away from my place and has never disappointed. I wouldn't suggest the omlettes, not bad but not the best.  The Benny's, poached pear salad, truffle fries and basically anything on special for the day have been DELISH!!!  It's a staple brunch spot for downtown.  They do not take reservations so be prepared to wait unless you  get there at open."
5 star rating,"Everyone kept saying how great this place is so I had to try it. Have tried to go a couple times prior but the wait was always 45 mins+. Went early for breakfast on a Sat, no wait. Decent vibe. Ordered food. Waited 30 mins and food finally arrived. I wanted to love this place, but the food was not good, cold eggs, terrible cubed tasteless potatoes and no condiments on the table. $30 not including tip for two mediocre breakfasts. Will never go back."
2 star rating,"This has become my daughters absolute favorite restaurant in the city - she is 23 yrs old.  I have enjoyed every meal I have eaten here.  I have been here at least a dozen times. They make perfect Bennys every time - perfect poached eggs. Great seasoning on every dish.  The Spicy Benny is my favorite.The Hash plates are tasty - tried them all. The Korean bbq, cheesesteak, and beef burger are all flavorful.My daughter always enjoys their waffle specials - Girl Scout, Canoli, etc. A little on the sweet side for me but I do not have a sweet tooth at all.  These are no where near IHOP sweet though.Service is top notch."
5 star rating,"A long wait on a Sunday morning, but decent coffee and good brunch! The waffle was delectable and the veggie hash was savory. I would return, but probably not during the brunch rush."
4 star rating,"Well.. this place is pretty pricey for what you get. When I went here, and got a salad with a drink, the salad was near 12 dollars, but I could get on equivalent in quantity and quality at a place near my house for 2/3 the price.The drinks taste on par with all the other restaurants near by,  but the view and the experience is what makes the trip.The quantity of food you get is what made it two starts instead of three. So far, this is one of the few places I left hungry, but I am the piggy type :P"
2 star rating,"O.....M.....G..... THIS PLACE IS AMAZZZZZZZINGGG! The food here is so fresh, the service is so friendly, and the ambiance is so cute and trendy. Such a cute little date spot, and I do mean little. So when you come, it's better to only come as a duo seeing that seating is very limited. But oh it's worth the wait. Everything little thing contributed to an amazing brunch experience. The tea, organic and flavorful (yes, I'm such as snob when it comes to tea). I made my own omelette and everything was to perfection. My hubby loved his food as well which was french toast, scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage. They use a special blend for their sausage and my hubby's picky self loved it! And we both had potatoes which were fab! The jam was delish as well! Seriously, every little thing contributed to this meal! This place gets an A+ in my book. I'm looking forward to coming back!"
5 star rating,"Detroit's most coveted brunch spot. No call ahead reservations, weekend waits are usually about 15-30min during prime time. It's in the beautiful historic Chrysler building, so kill the wait time with some architectural exploring or sit in the well furnished large whisky leather lobby couches. Street parking downtown is free on Sundays, so take advantage of that for your next Sunday brunch here. Just don't take forever sitting around, I still want to eat here again too"
5 star rating,"This place was amazing. We went on a Saturday morning and had a party of 7 so we had to wait 40 minutes which I wasn't excited about. But it was soon worth the wait! I had the french toast with fruit and a chai latte, they were both delicious!"
5 star rating,"We lucked out and got a table for four right when we walked in because the place was packed, which is a good sign when you're trying some place new. All our brunch menu items were delish and even though it was packed, the service was great. Added bonus: craft cocktail menu with some fun drinks to try because what's brunch without some booze? Check this place out!"
5 star rating,"Decided to road trip to Detroit. Found Dime Store on Yelp and we weren't disappointed. We ordered Bennys, the Cheesesteak and Smoked Salmon. Plus shared the Brioche French Toast. Everything was delicious from the first bite. P.S. the Beermosa is  amazing!"
4.5 star rating,Love this place!  From the time I walked in I knew this place was awesome. Breakfast sandwich was crazy good!  Decor and staff super cool...  Check this one out when in the motor city!
5 star rating,"The duck confit Reuben was delicious--just the right proportion of ingredients. I'd call it one of the best sandwiches I've had. I was visiting Detroit; if I ever have the opportunity to return, Dime Store duck Reuben is a must."
5 star rating,"Food was alright, duck hash pretty good, not terrific because it was too sweet. The problem is that they sat us two at the bar at the kitchen right next to where waiters pick up food. After waiting for over an hour. No ifs ands or buts. So it was uncomfortable. See pic. Most restaurants that have wait lists do them for tables and bar is first come basis. So it's jarring to be sat at the bar after waiting so long. Service was good otherwise."
3 star rating,We had a great brunch. The food was very well done and the staff was top notch. I appreciated how kind and friendly the staff was to twin toddlers.
5 star rating,What's not to like? Tasty food.  A few twists on traditional dishes like a duck pon hash.  Drinks! Lively space with attentive staff.  I'd be back.
5 star rating,"This place rocks! Got into Detroit on the redeye.  Went to Dime Store at 10a. Saw the duck reuben on the menu. Asked if it was available.  Waiter told me everything on the menu is available at all times.  That's what I'm talking about!Reuben was outstanding. So were the brussel sprouts I got on the side.  Great decor. Place was packed at 10a on a Friday, but we got our food quickly. Menu says everything is local. I like that too. We're here for a week so I'm sure I'll be back. There was a Korean BBQ slider or something that looked good too."
5 star rating,"Wow, Seriously this place is on point!! Great food, great service. If you come here and don't have the Korean fries, you just waisted your time. Nice job Dime Store can't wait to return!!!"
5 star rating,"Brunch: the meal you require on weekends to simultaneously recover from yesterday's poor decisions while preparing you for today's worse ones. And the Dime Store nails it.Like any place worth it's water, there was a slight wait for a seat today. But the hostess called the wait time perfectly and got us seated at the bar in about 20 minutes. I'll take that all day. At the bar, we were well taken care of by Mike. In addition to providing great service he was also a pleasure to socialize with. During the course of our meal and conversation he managed to convince me to supplement my coffee with a Soft Parade Beermosa. Thank you Mike: you have now justified the existence of Soft Parade to this beer drinker. Oh yeah...there was food. I had a half order of the spicy Korean fries and the Duck Bop Hash. The fries were topped with shaved beef, pickled veggies and spicy mayo. What a starter! I could have just done a full order and gone home happy, but that would have deprived me of the hash. Duck confit, spinach and Sriracha. Absolutely killer. One of the best brunch meals I've had...anywhere.My only complaint is that I am now in such a food coma that my thumb is the only part of my body capable of moving to write this review. When we discuss where to go to brunch, it's obvious why we can't come up with ideas other than The Dime Store. We don't have much reason to go anywhere else. Gold stars all around."
5 star rating,"Wow. GO THERE. Don't think. GO.Me & my SO went here today for the first time (Sat 9/19 morning, arrived around 10:40am) - was promptly seated at the best seats in the house - at the bar looking into the kitchen, right next to where all the delicious, picturesque food orders came out. Heavy breathing commenced immediately as we tried to figure out what each plate was. Our server was very attentive & gave us the down low on the specials of the day, and she brought us our drinks quickly. We saw a mac & cheese side with pork belly come out next to us and decided we HAD to order that to share, because holy hell. I had the Pork Belly Benedict with side salad & my SO had the Duck Hash. While we waited for our orders we sat & watched the efficient and effortless kitchen kick out some amazingly beautiful dishes. You absolutely could not go wrong, no matter what you ordered here, it seemed. Portions were extremely generous, even drinkwise. The bread they use looked to be about 1.5"" thick and fresh as hell - the sandwiches created with it were ridiculous. The burgers on the grill & plates looked extra generous and well made. The fries we saw looked like nicely cooked steak fries, served very generously, again, with parmesan and pork belly. Giant bowls of grilled brussell sprouts with pork belly from heaven appeared. So did more benedicts (I almost wish I had order the smoked salmon one because, damn, it looked amazing), omelets, pork rinds.....on and on and on. Window shopping for foods. We were not at all disappointed in our orders. It tasted just as good as it looked, which was perfect. Great amounts of flavor. All their food is sourced locally & listed on their menu. Zimmermans coffee too.The crowd definitely picked up after 11:00am or so - get there as early as possible. It's not a big place & not the best for large parties. We will absolutely be back. New favorite spot downtown. Held up to our expectations & more. You da best, Dime Store."
5 star rating,"Staff was friendly... turned tables quickly, food was out of this world and service was excellent.   B"
4.5 star rating,Service and food rock here!  Best breakfast in Detroit. We had a great time and the Bloody Mary was awesome.
5 star rating,"In Detorit from California on business, found this gem on Yelp and boy o' boy are we glad we did. Had the duck confit on rye, bacon parm truffle fries, cauliflower gruyere soup and each and everyone was exquisite. Decides to yelp so that other out-of-towners can hopefully find this yummy place too. Thank you Dime Store. We will certainly return when were back in town"
5 star rating,Excellent place for breakfast/brunch...  I would try to get their before 10 AM on weekends to avoid a long wait...
5 star rating,"Amazing duck hash!! Highly recommend and would order again. Ordered the Irish coffee as well which was very good. Be prepared to wait, but while you wait can review menu."
5 star rating,It's great for brunch and their atmosphere is wonderful. Definitely like bringing people in from out of town here.
4 star rating,I like this place a lot. It's a bit on the small side. The food is delicious and above average pricing but worth it. It's extremely busy on Sundays you have a better chance of going as a group of 2. Wait staff is very kind and on point. All in all this is a great place for brunch and you won't be let down
5 star rating,My favorite breakfast in Detroit. They use organic free range eggs. Also staff have are very polite
5 star rating,It's a cute little places tucked inside the Chrysler building. The place is quite packed on weekends n the wait is worth it. The food is great but come with an appetite cause the portions are good.
4 star rating,"Really enjoyed this spot for breakfast. Right near Michigan ave. Omelette and the sausage hash were both very good. Coffee was also solid, Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
5 star rating,"Went here today for breakfast with a friend. The atmosphere and food were awesome. We both had the breakfast sandwich with turkey sausage, egg whites, and spinach! We skipped the salad and opted for potatoes instead! Yummmm!!!"
4.5 star rating,We had lunch on St Patrick's day and only had to wait a few minutes for a table. We split the bullogi sandwich and poached pear salas. Both were excellent as was the service. Great prices too. Will be back.
5 star rating,"So good! We ended up here with crippling hangovers after a friends wedding. Big Mike at the bar greeted us with beermosas, recommendations, conversation and eventually pulled us from the depths. The food is fabulous- pork belly Benny, housemade sausage hash, mac and cheese...and everything that strolled out of the open kitchen looked equally amazing. Highly recommended."
5 star rating,"I've only ever gotten take out from here. I work nearby. Tried to order again today - an order for 8 people - was told today that they don't do to go orders for 6+ on weekends. Instead of calling back with two separate orders of 3 we'll be taking our business elsewhere. I called called with an order for the same group two days ago and had to talk to 4 different people before we were told that they ""maybe"" could do our order to call back in an hour. Then told they could, they'd call when it was ready, probably more than an hour. Twenty minutes later our food was ready. Terrible customer service over the phone. I've never found somewhere that does take out that's turning away orders. Very frustrating experiences. Even if they had the best food in the world their service would kill the experience. But the food wasn't even that good. Their philly cheesesteak wasok, but small sandwhich no sides for $10? I'd rather just got to which wich down the road, friendly service and fast. Very disappointed on what's supposed to be a delicious Detroit staple."
1 star rating,"We absolutely loved everything we ordered from here, the food was so good. We weren't as impressed with our drinks: Spanish coffee and mimosas, but the food was delicious and we plan on coming back soon!"
4 star rating,"Very nice young staff this place holds. Sometimes you worry when a restaurant has young people working but this is not one of them. The view is also great. It is technically a swamp but being able to see the sunset gave it a very homey touch. The food was excellently prepared, for me it was the Mahi Mahi sandwich. I also had their key lime pie for desert. It was excellently prepared and delivered. The pie itself was okay but not the best I had. That title is held by Mimi's cafe in California. Overall my #1 recommended restaurant in the area of Bonita Springs."
5 star rating,Stopped in for a quick breakfast. The food came fast and the service was great. It was fresh and reasonable in price. Great location with good atmosphere. I got the fresh sausage hash. Avocado looked great and got some extra sirracha with my meal. Got a cold brew with nitrogen. It was a neet trick but not really sure it justified the price. Tasted like any normal cold brew that was a little more frothy. Would go again.
4 star rating,"Always delicious! It can get really busy, but if you go in earlier you will not be disappointed!"
5 star rating,"While the wait was a little long and it's a small space, I'd go back. The one thing to get is the pork rinds. That's right. I'm not a fan of the packaged ones but my co-conspirator wanted to try them. Wow! I never thought I'd like pork rinds. Going back and will order these again. Oh yeah, the rest of the food was good too."
5 star rating,"AMAZING brunch! It was a bit of a wait for a table, but it was totally worth it!  Absolutely delicious drinks and food. Service was on point without being in your face.  Totally would return!"
5 star rating,Terrific brunch/lunch spot. Very crowded and vibrant loud bustle about the place. Sometimes a bit of a wait. Food is delicious and the staff are very attentive. The coffee is excellent! The omelette are fluffy and perfect.  Hips your own. Is perfect. We really liked this place.
4.5 star rating,"When there are 3 entrees you want to order, but there are only 2 people... First world problems of the brunch world :xTo be honest, I didn't think much of Dime Store when I first heard it, because I thought it was a museum in a potentially sketchy area. Then after seeing the pictures as a hip brunch place on par with the ranks of Portland and SF, I was all in for a trip to Detroit. (Insert comment about gentrification)Dime Store features an enticing menu with creative spins on brunch classics. Some of the dishes have a Korean influence to spice things up (pun intended), like the incorporation of bulgogi or a pan-Asian flair like pork belly. They also have a seasonal specials menu which is the perfect excuse to come back again and again.While I frequently dismiss fries because you can add virtually anything and it will taste (and look) good, I was quite impressed with Dime Store's creations. The Korean fries are all the hype on Yelp, but since we've had our share of bulgogi fries in California (*trying not to sound like a snob*), we started off with the BACON, PARM, & TRUFFLE FRIES ($6/half order) The bacon lardons were chunky cuts of smokey meaty goodness, coupled with a strong overtone of truffle oil and parmesan shavings for the ultimate bouge comfort food.The DUCK BOP HASH WITH PICKLED VEGGIES AND SRIRACHA ($12.5) had nice fusion flavors, featuring a generous portion of duck confit in a quasi-bibimbap, hash style. I recommend sharing; unless you are all about pickled veggies, it can get a bit tiresome after awhile, and the runny eggs render it not very take-out-able. The BLUEBERRY LAVENDER CUSTARD ALMOND-CRUSTED FRENCH TOAST (~$12) from the specials menu was an excellent brunch dessert. The French toast itself is indulgent and satisfying, with a soft eggy interior contrasting with crunchy chopped almonds on the edges. It paired well with the blueberry compote and custard sauce which tasted like condensed milk--unfortunately, the lavender got lost in the sweet mayhem.We had to forego the BENEDICTS, but the Philly cheesesteak Benedict essentially looked like a brunch burger and the pork belly Benedict had such thick cuts that would embarrass any ramen shop. The wait can get crazy on weekends, but thankfully you don't have to get here by 8am and eat a hefty brunch while still half asleep (Things I don't miss about SF). We arrived around 9:30 and there were a few bar seats and tables open. I'd say you're fine if you get here by 10, if you don't have a huge group.Ambiance is what you'd expect for a hip brunch place, nothing too gimicky but a hint of vintage industrial with the tall ceilings and Instagrammable wall decor. (""There has never been a sadness that can't be cured by breakfast food"".... story of my millennial life.)"
5 star rating,"Amazing breakfast, great decor. Definitely get the duck bop - we all kept reaching over and stealing from the guy who ordered that. Close second the cheesesteak benny! Will definitely come back when in Detroit."
5 star rating,"Coming from Vancouver, I'm spoiled with a lot of great options for brunch. Dime Store is definitely up there! I had the pork belly benny with a jalapeno pesto. So delicious! Great service, awesome ambiance, and it's fresh, local, but quick! My friend had the hash... also great. This place is definitely worth checking out!"
5 star rating,"Great food, inventive menu, amazing coffee and attentive service. What else could you ask for?"
5 star rating,"Great food, cool decor. We were in town visiting for a family reunion and found this place on Yelp. My parents loved it (and they are hard to please). My Dad had the burger- good, solid beef burger. My mom had the chicken salad and loved it. My husband had the duck and thought it was fantastic. I had the cod sandwich as a salad and it was great. It is a great option to have all sandwiches available as a salad. The service was also good, although our waitress was new, she tried her best. Bar selection was great too. We would definitely stop through again."
4 star rating,"This is by far one of my favorite spots in Detroit proper. I love the Korean fusion and different spins on traditional breakfast items. The menu is expansive, and even though I have my favorites, I know I can go in and get something different and unique each time. Their Bloody Mary is on point, with a huge pickle spear dipped in."
5 star rating,Legitimate breakfast brunch spot with an interestingly delicious take on a breakfast burrito. Sub turkey sausage for the beef and it's still awesome. Need some energy? Ask for ginger beer with a splash of nitro  coffee. Their Spotify playlist will set you right. Don't let the generic facade fool you. This breakfast spot is one of a kind.
5 star rating,"So unimpressed and underwhelmed! I heard nothing but great things about this place and I was extremely disappointed. They brought me the wrong order three times. I was extremely polite and the guy serving me still had an attitude...like I was personally attacking him or something. I just wanted my food the way I ordered it. When I did get my food it had no flavor. I took two bites of my omelette and I was still charged full price for a meal I did not eat. I could've made something 10x better at home, so that's what I'll do next time. Some of the worst service I've ever received. Such a let down."
1 star rating,"This place is sooooo good! Be prepared to wait on the weekend for the brunch crowd, but it's worth the wait. Everything I've had here is so full of flavor. The service is incredible. Especially if you have Big Mike wait on you at the bar. This is by far my fav place for brunch in Detroit! Don't listen to the millennial naysayers reviews....they need to stop being so picky with their entitled spoiled attitudes. I LOVE THIS PLACE!! A Detroit Dime-mond!"
5 star rating,A quaint restaurant with great brunch. I had the chefs special french toast which was excellent.
4.5 star rating,Good! I love duck bop hash. A little noisy.
4 star rating,"Have been here twice to pick up takeout (their chicken salad sandwich is amazing!).The service is great, I love the space, and the food is worth driving for.Will be back again and again!"
4 star rating,"The service is great. They waited almost a half hour to seat is as people strolled in and were ok with separate checks. Prices are reasonable and portions good. However, everyone in my seven-member party said their food was bland. I wonder if they just had an off day in the kitchen. So I have to give three stars."
3 star rating,"I enjoyed a great brunch here. I had eggs, potatoes, and seared brussel sprouts. I created my own breakfast from the menu. I also ordered a bloody mary and it was really good! It did not come with bacon in it but my waitress added a slice for me! The only bad thing is the venue is so small. We waited an hour to be seated and we were sat at the bar. It was very hot because it was next to grill. Other than that, it was very good. I would return."
4 star rating,Great omelette with potatoes and roast. Hot delicious coffee. Busy today had to wait 30 minutes for table but nice lobby of Chrysler Building to wait in.
5 star rating,"Been here for breakfast a few times and never has disappointed. They have great hot breakfast sandwiches to go with their cool vibe! This place for the food and atmosphere is five star but I give it four since you can not call ahead to reserve seats and if you don't get there early you will be in for a wait. The prices are a little high but that is forgiven because for one your not really getting traditional breakfast foods and you are downtown. The two times I've been here once I've had the housemade turkey breakfast sausage sandwich and the bacon avocado omelette. Both had good flavor, were a good portion size and fueled me up for my day of exploring downtown. I look forward to coming here again to try some more of the menu items that are not breakfast focused."
4 star rating,"I had an awesome breakfast here! I ordered (at the recommendation of my server) the duck confit hash - it was awesome!! It had so many yummy flavors I love - a Korean sauce, sriracha, cilantro - it was awesome. It was a little on the sweet side but I enjoyed every last bite of it. Hope I get to go back some day!"
5 star rating,"I loved this place. Awesome food. Fast service. The wait time is a little long but they are kind and accomodating.Love this place for breakfast.  Be ready to spend though, not on the cheap side but not overboard too.Will be definitely coming back here."
5 star rating,"My wife and I came in for an amazing breakfast and we look forward to coming back. The atmosphere is really cool, the service was friendly and the food was great. We lived the veggie hash with eggs and creme fraiche. The blueberry compote on the side really added to it. We also had an amazing turkey sausage breakfast sandwich - fresh brioche bun and a nice green side salad. As it was vacation, the mimosas hit the spot and so did the Atwater beer. This is a really hip place that certainly has its act together!"
5 star rating,"DUCK. BOP. HASH. Once that made it into my mouth I have not ordered anything else since. Best thing on the menu, and one of my favorite breakfast dishes ever."
4.5 star rating,"Porchetta brought me down for lunch! Been here multiple times for brunch each time food was fresh, tasted good, hot and creative. The only draw back at times when they're busy, service lags a bit (on the most part our servers we're attentive as possible). I came down on a Friday afternoon for their Porchetta Sandwich, all the ingredients inside the Sandwich complented the Porchetta beautifully the only bump here was the bun altho fresh did lil to complement the whole sandwich it kinda overwhelmed it (too much bread to meat/ingredients ratio) maybe a toasted Pretzel bun or thin slices of toasted sour dough bread, I ended up enjoying it like an open face sandwich (took the top half of bun off). I also ordered the Parm, Truffle & Bacon fries, here they are always on point! Best in town hands down! The saltiness of the parmesan cheese, bacon and the truffle oil (no they are not greasey) on the fries make for a nice balance (here the base aka Fries shine, a thicker cut potato and stays crispy with a mashed potatoe center, Perfect!) I'll always keep coming back if for anything else the Parm Fries alone. My servicer (I sat at the counter) Mike was very informative made a good drink (Tito's & Cranberry lime twist) and ""chatted me up"" which I appreciated(makes for excellent customer service). Only four stars this time around for the bread issue alone, a bit redundant yes but when you take the time to make a Porchetta you need to take the time to present it appropriately. Will be back tho!"
4 star rating,"I pass this place nearly every day and have been wanting  check it out for almost a year. It was busier than I expected for a Friday afternoon, but the wait wasn't bad at all, less than ten minutes. All the employees are extremely friendly and polite. The menu has a great selection of sweet and savory brunch items. I had a brioche French toast which  was amazing. They had a great selection of beer & cocktails made by big Mike, the bartender who's full of personality. I would definitely recommend Dime store for brunch."
5 star rating,Amazing! Great food and the service is exemplary. We asked the Concierge at the Crowne Plaza for a breakfast recommendation and he was on point. Thanks Ivory! You must try their homemade turkey sausage.
5 star rating,I go here often for lunch since I work downtown and I LOVE this place. From the chai tea to the  soup to the salads; everything is delish!!
5 star rating,"Always good. It's actually my teams favorite place to go. First time I had Brunch. Be prepared to wait!Atmosphere is great, but the dining room is small along with a small kitchen. They do a good job of elevating most items on the menu.Service is good, and friendly. No mistakes when ever I sit in. Be careful when picking up food because they usually forget or mess up at least one meal.This time for brunch I had the turkey sausage egg sandwich with spinach. It was served like a burger with a fat but not overly large turkey sausage patty. Was served on a soft brioche bun with a white egg omelette with spinach. Was a little concerned about the spinach because that is easy to screw up but was done correctly. Really liked the serving size and how they elevated it turning it into a burger almost."
4 star rating,Excellent breakfast joint with a real hipster feel. Bacon & cheese omelette was one of the best I've ever had. Would love to come back to try a burger for lunch.
5 star rating,Thank goodness the parking around this spot is so hard otherwise I would go broke in this place. I finally made it to the Dime Store and wow it didn't disappoint. I had the french toast off the specials menu and hands down it was the best french toast I have ever had. I should have stopped eating before the last 4 bites but I just had to stuff it all in my belly leaving me overstuffed! My eating partner had the Gobbleberry Benny also off the special list and my eyes were wide open when it came. He kept saying how awesome it was so I assume it was yummy. Both dishes were beautiful on the plate. I had a window seat and it was a little drafty but I'm sure when it's not so cold out it would be a nice spot.
5 star rating,My absolute favorite spot to take friends (local or from out of town) for brunch!  I haven't had a dish yet that didn't exceed my expectations!  Well done!
5 star rating,The brunch is amazing!I had the andouille hash and it was very flavorful. The service was excellent - everyone in the restaurant was friendly and energetic. My husband had the cheesesteak benny and he loved it! We'll definitely be back.
5 star rating,"What a find! After days of eating awful catered meals at the RenCen Marriott, Dime Store really hit the spot. So many sandwiches on the lunch menu sounded delicious that I had a hard time choosing. I eventually went with the Korean BBQ and it was the right choice. Whenever I'm back in downtown Detroit I'll be back to try the rest of the menu. The duck Ruben and PBLT (pork belly, lettuce, tomato) are calling my name. Great little place."
4.5 star rating,Had a great breakfast today! Bacon and avocado omelette. Delicious way to start off the day! Great service by Keira :-)
5 star rating,"So much hype so much let down. Got here Sunday morning and obviously expected a wait given the reviews and how packed this place is. 45 min wait for 5 people isn't too bad. Once we got it - we shared a much larger table and decor was funky and fresh. The Seats weren't especially comfortable and totally reminded me of being in school in the 70/80's. Hard wood seats and squeaked and scraped the floor (making an awful noise) when you moved your seat. Anyway, menu looked pretty good, but I was so disappointed by my Sausage Hash Breakfast - literally the sausage has zero spice or taste. I was really surprised. Everyone else's food was just average as well - nothing fantastic or amazing. It's a bummer - the breakfast place we went to the day before blew this place out of the water. Oh well....on to the next."
2 star rating,The PhillyCheeseSteak Benny was absolutely amazing!! Would come Back to Detroit for this one.  Crispy potatoes & marmalade jam & Brussels sprouts were fabulous as well.
5 star rating,"Nice place in downtown !Very nice waitress ! I had the chicken burger with peach and orange jam, I was quite scared at first but it happened to be excellent !"
5 star rating,All around I had a solid experience. It was my first time and the food arrived quickly and everything was prepared well and plated with care. My only issue was seating. Polished concrete and single post tables don't mix. The table rocked at the slightest touch and spilled my drink. Additionally in an effort to generate more covers the tables are ridiculously close together. I got up to go to the bathroom room and let's just say I was intimately aquatinted with the ladies next to me and their food. It's worth the price but be sure to find the right table.
4 star rating,Just Decent food but very loud atmosphere if you want to visit with someone the service was good
3 star rating,Amazing food. Service is great and happy. And Jeffery one of the owners was so pleasant to talk to. I have gone back 3 times in the past 2 weeks. Must have *HASH*

Don't listen to the millennial naysayers reviews....they need to stop being so picky with their entitled spoiled attitudes. I LOVE THIS PLACE!! A Detroit Dime-mond!"
5 star rating,"I made a call in order for the first time to the Dime Store on last Friday.  The person who answered the phone was very friendly.  When I arrived, the host was super friendly and engaging and the place was abuzz. I was a little surprised to see such a crowd in the restaurant after 2pm on a Friday.  I was thinking, ""this place is really cool, I'm going to eat in next time.""I got my food and didn't want to leave because the staff was so friendly and it just looked like a place that's cool to hang out and get a good meal.Oh, yeah, my chicken salad sandwich was DELICIOUS!!!  Fruit was good, too!I came back to work and let everybody know, we gotta check this place out and make sure we send folks here who visit our venue!"
5 star rating,We enjoyed brunch here on a chilly Saturday morning last winter.  We really liked the cozy eclectic space and the food was spot on!  We had the french toast and the egg and bacon sandwich.  Both were so tasty and the atmosphere was cool.  Service was good and we'd go back given the chance!
4.5 star rating,"Yesterday was my first time here and loved it! They serve breakfast all day.I ordered the egg and smoked salmon sandwich... It was so good!! Coffee was also good.The place was crowded so we had to wait about 20 min for a table. Then once seated our food took also about 25 min to come in; they did apologize for the wait and applied a 50 percent off from our bill which we did not take but added as a tip. The food was worth the wait and we were in no rush, plus the ambience was nice and the waiters and hostess were taking good care of us; so we were overall happy about our meal experience. We will come back!"
5 star rating,"While the wait is usually long, the food is extremely tasty and service is quick and efficient. This is a good place for brunch for a always delicious menu, but in my opinion, it does not allow for the most laid back or leisurely experience. If you're looking for a multi-hour drawn out brunch with many cups of coffee with a friend you have lots to catch up on, I would go here first for the food and then have another less busy restaurant or park lined up for afterwards."
4 star rating,"Fantastic place.  The buzz in here is what Detroit is trying to generate right now as many downtown buildings are undergoing restoration and renovation.  So much commerce and business taking place here - and the reason is simple.  AMAZING food in a central location.  So glad the hotel valet recommended this place! You might wait a little bit for yor food, but everyone does.  It's superb and there are a lot of people waiting for the same reward."
5 star rating,I have heard about this place for years and finally had a chance to try it. This was the best corned beef hash I've ever had. The place was packed with a great vibe and happy customers. I will be back next time I'm in town.
5 star rating,"My wife and I go to a lot of places for brunch, this is one of our go to spots. It's is nice and modern but still has a welcoming feel to it. The food is always good and not too expensive."
5 star rating,Good food and service. Plus you get to listen to Nickelback for an hour! Seriously. Please stop playing Nickelback.
4 star rating,Unique breakfast fare...duck confit hash with hints of maple syrup topped with a nice compliment of pickled vegetables.  Smooth well flavored hollandaise topped a pork and biscuit stack with a crisp salad dressed lightly with an vinegar and oil dressing. Good coffee and chai tea to boot!!  We highly recommend the Dime Store.
5 star rating,"mmmmmm yummy breakfast for breonnamy roommate and I got there around 10:45 and had a 30 minute wait. totally expected. While we were eating waiter said that people are now waiting about an hour to be sat. I got the duck bop. wow, there was so much flavor in that. they did mess up my egg. I wanted it over medium, but I got my friends over easy egg and it was too much yolk and sauce everywhere. the service was good. One thing that bugged me though was that we said it was fine for us to sit at the bar. They called our number and said it will be a second because they are moving the trash and needed to grab another chair. About 3-5 minutes go by and we are waiting by the door while TWO other couples are getting sat. It just really bugged me because we were there before them, and they were sat before us. very inefficient. they should have given us the table. Overall, really good breakfast though. I want to try something else next time."
4 star rating,"Wow, I have lived in Metro Detroit my whole life and never had the opportunity to eat at the Dime Store until now. I showed up during the lunch rush with no reservations and they still managed to seat me and my guest at the bar. Our service was incredible, I forget our bartenders name but I would return here just to hang out with him! The food was incredible as well, large portions, affordable, and CREATIVE. They had bacon INSIDE my Belgium waffle and I couldn't wait to try my own creation that weekend.Overall, I will be returning time and time again as well as recommending to friends."
5 star rating,"I came here because of the awesome Yelp reviews and delicious looking menu (hello, truffle fries and mac & cheese, WITH breakfast? YES). After being seated and looking over the menu, I was talked into getting the special ""A Whole New World Benny"": Housemade falafel topped with pickled cabbage, two poached eggs, hollandaise and roasted red pepper-cucumber relish; served with quinoa salad. Overall it was really good but the relish and quinoa salad were a little watery and mixed some of the flavors together and made the plate runny. Falafel was delicious!If you love fries you MUST get the Bacon - Parm -Truffle Fries. They were hand cut, had a generous dusting of Parm and huge chunks of bacon that my BF devoured. The Mac & Cheese: When I asked how good it was, the server replied ""it's the bomb."" Well, he was not kidding, it was the bomb. It was creamy, rich, and cheesy. So good. I only wish I had room to eat it all. BF got the Korean BBQ sandwich. He thought it was phenomenal. He said it was BBQ beef version of a Bhan Mi. Service was interesting. We could not tell if our server was being scarcastic with us as he was short at times and almost seemed like he was mad that we took pics of our food (to post with this review). At one point he did a drive by and dropped off a glass of water and I said ""Thank you!"" to which he replied ""Yooour WELcome!"" in a high pitched sing-songy voice back to us. It was just so awkward and seemed intentional that it was hard to shake the feeling that we were def not his favorite table."
4.5 star rating,"Visiting from Boston we picked Dime for its unique menu and breakfast yumminess and we thought it was awesome. We ordered off the regular menu: steak & cheese Benedict, smoked salmon Benedict and French toast. Great coffee too"
5 star rating,"Great spot for breakfast/brunch! My build-your-own omelette was great and the breakfast potatoes were some of the best I've ever had...it's seriously worth coming here just for those.  Very cool vibe and friendly service; I highly recommend coming here if you're staying in the area. Note that it's a small place, so be prepared to wait if you arrive after 10am on the weekend."
5 star rating,A poor attempt at trying to be a trendy downtown breakfast shop. The potatoes were the pre shredded frozen variety. The eggs were over cooked. The spicy ketchup tasted like Heinz with some kind of poorly blended spicy added and this concoction was drizzled all over the dish. I won't be back. At least they have good coffee.
1 star rating,"Officially my favorite brunch spot! Supreme customer service. All of the staff is fantastic. Mackalia and Lauren (serves during different visits), had genuine recommendations, personable attitudes, and kept our glasses full. The food is phenomenal!!! The peach muffins, sausage hash, spicy korean fries--frankly anything on the menu knocked it right out of the park. I love it!I would recommend it to anyone, and eveyone."
5 star rating,"The entire experience here was a pleasure. Waited about 15 minutes for a seat, but that's to be expected around noon. Service was speedy and the food-the food was phenomenal! I had the black bean sweet potato chili, and the pork belly Benny. My boyfriend had the Duck Bop Hash. We love trying new places and this one did not disappoint. We are already talking of a repeat visit. Try the Pork Belly Benny!"
5 star rating,Stopped in for a late lunch.  The service was Excellent. The owner and server were very friendly.  We had the pulled pork BBQ sandwich and a build your own omelette.  Food was awesome!  Homemade biscuit was the best I've ever had!
5 star rating,Went here with my Lovesband for my birthday weekend. Loved everything about this spot. It was about an hour wait but well worth it. We ordered the   Lavender Blueberry  French Toast and the bacon avocado omelette. It was delicious! We will definitely return. We had the most awesome waitress. Her name fails me but she was great!
4 star rating,Went here for the first time with some friends for a Tuesday lunch. The food here is on point.
5 star rating,I would drive the 3 hours to Detroit another weekend to again eat at the dime store. We sat at the counter and loved watching the chefs in action. Great service. Food ticket time very reasonable. And YUM
5 star rating,"Coming from Vancouver, I'm spoiled with a lot of great options for brunch. Dime Store is definitely up there! I had the pork belly benny with a jalapeno pesto. So delicious! Great service, awesome ambiance, and it's fresh, local, but quick! My friend had the hash... also great. This place is definitely worth checking out!"
4.5 star rating,Nice menu.  Really friendly people there. The burgers looked awesome.  I wanted something lighter though and got the salmon salad.  It was really tasty.  Loved the dressing.  Walking distance from Cobo so good for conference goers.
5 star rating,A great brunch spot! I did the make your own omelet which included goat cheese. Omg... so much goat cheese and so melty. It was amazing. My friend got the sausage hash and she loved hers as well. A must go! The only negative was the peach mimosas. I wish regular champagne was an option because brunch is not complete without mimosas.
5 star rating,Some of the best steak Benedict I've ever tried which means a lot since I'm from Chicago with all the good food.The bloodys and mimosas are to die for but the service needs major improvement.
4 star rating,They have the best breakfast in the city. My wife and I must go there every time we are in town. Out of this world.  The staff is great very friendly and the atmosphere is wonderful.

5 star rating,"Love this place.  Cozy atmosphere and very helpful staff.  I like sitting at the counter in front of the kitchen - the staff is fun to interact with and it's cool to watch them work.I had the waffle special with strawberries and jam, and it rocked.  Coffee was good too.  My wife had an omelette and loved it.  Get there early, though, the place is small and gets packed quickly."
5 star rating,"I'm not sure why people keep opening these fancy hipster restaurants and making them tiny, but I digress. Fortunately, the food was good. The service was ""meh"", and definitely could be improved. Be prepared to wait way too long. I would come back during a weekday."
4 star rating,"My wife and I are visiting Detroit and found this place on Yelp. Great great food! I ordered ""The Frenchman's hash"". It has seasonal vegetables in it. Holy cow was it belly busting good! Service was great as well, friendly smiles all around. If I'm ever back in this town I'm coming back to this place!"
4 star rating,"Just moved into the city and this was the first brunch spot my wife and I had tried. Long wait so we ordered to go. We really enjoyed everything. The turkey sausage hash and Brioche French Toast was honestly really good.   The only down turn is that I'm from a large family and we love to eat out. Our second visit it was a two hour wait and they wouldn't even take our to go order because it was more then 6 meals. They lost a star for that,  other then that I enjoyed it and I like what's happening in the city."
4 star rating,Great place for brunch!  Got right in on a Thursday late morning.  Our waitress was so friendly and gave great service.  I ask for something that wasn't on the menu and she checked on it and the chef prepared the best corn beef hash!  I will for sure go back!
5 star rating,"Reviewing the Dime Store is a bit of a fickle b_t_h!!Why you say well if you have nothing better to do but sit wait an hour or more, my party and I waited an hour and 40 minutes, then by all means it's the place to go...Just grab yourself a cup of their nitro infused Zinnemann's Joe and find a nice comfortable place to sit for a while.The Dime is a progressive meets old school dinner experience, The staff is very accommodating and friendly.Price not extreme for DTDThe Bacon, parm and truffle fries are awesomeAnd you have to try one of the Benny dishes with an extra side of Dearborn's finest Bacon. My favorite is the Cheesesteak.All in all my companions and I felt that it's was worth the wait..."
4.5 star rating,"Detroit Dime is a sign o' the times. Detroit is coming back and in a BIG way!I turned down Griswold, parked right outside the Dime Historical Building and pulled out my Park Detroit app. I slotted in section 105 and got an hour on the meter for $1.15 (there is a 15 cent up charge if you use the app instead of a pay station). There was no wait and we got prime seating in the window area. The half booth was well cushioned and topped with brown leather. The chairs and table were made out of wood which accented the vibe of the entire place. Once we were seated I was impressed by the vibrant energy of the crowd. An even mix of young professionals, hipsters, lunching ladies and various types of business people. This is a place to be in the D for sure. The plates that were being served at other tables offered a glimpse of what was in store and it all looked good. I chose the cheesesteak hoagie with a side of fries and my buddy went with a grilled cheese and added in jalapeños minus the seeds to cut down on the heat. We also decided to split the daily special of corned beef and sauerkraut. When the food arrived we dug in and and everything was good. The steak was a bit over seasoned but nothing a little spicy mayo couldn't enhance. The real standout was the corned beef with sauerkraut which was one of the best I've had in a long time with juicy beef and tart savory sauerkraut I'll come back here just for that. The service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing and we were happy enough with the meal and experience to not mind our $36.89 bill."
4 star rating,"After reading the reviews we had high hopes of liking this place. Unfortunately, the moment we walked in the building started off completely wrong. The reviews warned about the wait time so we were prepared to wait. However, the hostess was extremely rude and very dingy. We still decided to give them a chance. Placed our names on the list and patiently waited.After sitting and watching several groups of 4 or more be seated before our party of 2 I decided to return to the hostess to see where we were in line. The hostess said she thought she called our name and had scratched us off the list. How unprofessional. Not even an apology for the extra wait or oversight on her part. We were then seated in a small corner with the door to outside right next to the table and near the serving station for the waitress. The door was propped wide open and the cold windy day was turning this into a miserable experience. We asked to be moved and the manager was just as unprofessional as the hostess. We will not be returning!"
1 star rating,"Will definitely be back.  Love the decor, seats look like they are from old school desks, has a fun urban vibe.  Food was terrific, while it was lunch time mid week, they offered some great breakfast options.  Bacon waffles were great, feel like the portions are generous."
4 star rating,"Wasn't expecting this to be tucked away in a building, but this place exceeded my expectations! Our waitress was incredibly welcoming and the service was speedy. The coffee came quick and there was no charge for refills. The daily special was a lemon curd waffle and it blew me away. Crunchy waffle smothered in lemon curd topped with strawberries and crunch. All the other food ordered at the table looked gorgeous as well.Price was reasonable and I suggest going through the week because it will be more quiet and easy to get a table.Highly recommend this place!"
5 star rating,One of my favorite brunch spots! This is the first brunch place that comes to mind when I have people out of town come visit! I love the bulgolgi hash and the truffle fries are to die for! Always a long wait (because the foods so good) so make sure to come early!
5 star rating,"Been here before and love it every time!! The yogurt with honey granola , strawberry, blueberries.. soooo healthy & perfect. I can't wait to make that at home every day. We wished they had hash browns but every bite tasted great! I also tried the cheesesteak Benedict,super perfect breakfast with coffee & water of course! My breakfast go to in Downtown  Detroit!"
5 star rating,"We went on the weekend and as such, it was pretty busy and there was a 30 minute-ish wait. Went with some friends. Usually, I hate brunch. I have celiac disease and brunch used to be such a delicious fun time but now I can never eat anything except an omelette when what I really want is all the bread in the world, in my mouth. But I digress! Anyway, this was an awesome brunch. Our server was knowledgeable and they have delicious GF options. Yes, I got an omelette. But I could eat the potatoes! Which were amazing! AND while the omelette usually comes with some type of bread on the side which I said I did not want, our server kindly offered to bring me tomato slices instead since I couldn't eat the bread. Few places offer to do that when you have to decline some bread option that you know you're paying for anyway, and it was really nice of her to do that. We will definitely be back."
5 star rating,"The food is yummy, service was great ! The only thing I wish I could change were my BURNED turkey sausages. They were really burnt. Other than that everything was great and it's Black owned which is also great"
5 star rating,This place has hard core wait issues but it's a tiny place with some bomb ass food. So in the end it was worth it. I'd prefer Commonwealth in Birmingham.
5 star rating,"We came here on a Sunday, and it was packed. We were told 45 minutes to an hour, but waited an hour and 15 minutes to be seated. Luckily, there is a lot of space and seating in the Chrysler House lobby, and we were able to get coffee while we waited. Once seated, we immediately ordered bloody Mary's and peach mimosas, which were delicious, if not a bit weak. My sister and I split the smoked salmon benny and the cheesesteak benny. They were both delicious but we both preferred the salmon. My other sister had the sausage hash, which she enjoyed, although it was spicier than she expected. We also shared the bacon truffle fries, which were amazing and easily the best part of the meal. Overall, it was fantastic, but the wait was a bit longer than I'm normally willing to wait."
4.5 star rating,"Day trip to Detroit brought us to this fine establishment and we were happy campers! My husband had sent me an article awhile ago about spending 36 hours in Detroit so through that I found the Dime Store. We were starving after our Detroit Public library downtown tour, which I highly recommend. The restaurant is located inside the Chrysler building and we parked in the financial district parking garage next to it. $10 for parking, not bad. There's street parking but it was a busy Saturday! We had about a 30 minute wait which I was fine with. The hostess was super nice and chatty, she makes you feel like she's your friend! There were 5 of us and we sat at a table for 10, shared it with another family of 4. I was totally fine with it and we were able to scoot over so not to be too crowded! Anyway, we had an amazing lunch and I had brunch! I ordered the brioche French toast with bananas and strawberries on top, and it was the freshest fruit and made the toast delicious. My husband ordered the nacho burger on special and said it was one of the best burgers and they had him at the corn salsa! My daughter had the chicken pesto sandwich, and devoured it in 2 seconds with a side of Mac n cheese. My cousins ordered the Korean BBQ sandwich and a custom made grilled chicken sandwich with lettuce, onions, pickles and ketchup! Let me just say all of our plates were clean, not a speck left! And I couldn't finish mine so they even took bites and finished my French toast! Our waitress was also awesome, kept our drinks full and quick service. Special nod to the Rishi brand tea that they carry, delightful organic tea!"
5 star rating,Went here during my brunch and everyone else's  lunch.... completely packed. Gave me feeling of being in diner in the 50's. Had French toast. It was good but not in my top five of French toasts. I recommend trying it out.
5 star rating,"Definitely one of the best brunch place in Detroit! Highly recommended if you are in town. Went there on Saturday afternoon and it was packed, waited for an hour and a half. I love the food and overall dining atmosphere! I ordered the fried pork sandwich, I love how crunchy it is and you just enjoy every bite of it. Sadly, they don't take reservation and you won't be seated until your whole crew arrives."
5 star rating,I love this restaurant the food was delicious I had the strawberry field French toast and my husband had the avocado bacon omelette they were both delicious. Antonio the bartender was the best he had excellent customer service we even met a couple of new friends while we were there overall great experience
5 star rating,"Everything was delicious! Service was a tiny bit slow and lacking attentiveness, our server never asked if we would like more coffee; or if we needed anything when we got our food. His co-worker, while clearing plates from the table next to ours, did not grab our plates as well - which we had stacked and set to the side. Lack of teamwork bothers me, but the food was fantastic, we will be back for sure!"
4 star rating,"If your looking for a filling delicious breakfast/lunch. This is a must try! At first the wait times might scare you so be prepared to hear 1hour + especially on the weekends, but it goes much quicker and its definitely worth the wait!! Food comes our quick hot and correct, I'm a picky eater they did not disappoint! One of my new favorite spots down town!"
5 star rating,The food was amazing!!! From the time we walked in and was seated until the time we got up to leave the experience was great! Our server was really nice and the guy who sat us was easy on the eyes! Lol! We ordered the duck bop hash which comes with sunny side up eggs but they fried the egg for us....we also had a order of bacon and Belgium waffles which had the perfect crunch and the MI maple syrup wasnt to sweet but perfect for that waffle.....Id definitely recommend!
5 star rating,"Was not impressed with Dime Store. The first time we went they were closed for a private party, which I get happens, the second time we went they had just canceled their happy hour but didn't update their site so we paid full price. They also started closing early and we felt rushed the whole time. Overall, not a great experience. Will not be going back sadly."
2 star rating,Excellent - loved this place!!!  The food and menu is extensive and the atmosphere is even better. Loved the school chair seats :-)
5 star rating,"A friend and I had free tickets to go to the Auto Show and it was a perfect time to check out Dime Store too - which I was honestly MUCH more excited about than the cars. I confess I never really love having to wait to eat in a restaurant, but since Dime Store is in the awesome Chrysler House building there's a lovely, large and WARM (it's January now!) spot to wait and hang out - so major bonus points! Dime Store gets even more bonus points since they said the wait would be 25 mins (not bad for a Sunday @ 1:30) and it ended up being 15 minutes. We both loved the space - the huge windows are great and add light and good people watching. I loved the wooden seats repurposed from school desks too.I had ice tea (and they kept up with the refills nicely! Including one time when one of the owner's refilled it), a cup of the cauliflower gruyere (so good!) and the duck reuben. The reuben was a brilliant spin and really tasty - the duck itself, the pretty purple cabbage and the gruyere all so good - and the grain mustard just finished it off perfectly. I got the side salad instead of fries and I appreciated the arugula heavy greens w/the lemon dressing.Beyond the great food, and the relaxed, fun decor the service was top notch. Our waitress was awesome and it was clear that everyone working there was happy to be there. The fact that the owners were all on sight working says a lot. I can't wait to go back."
4.5 star rating,"This is a great place for breakfast.  Freshly prepared and chef inspired cuisine for breakfast? I'm down. I have tried a several things which were all tasty. However, the most memorable item I have eaten was the bacon.  No kidding.  Thick cut and meaty Dearborn bacon.  Not some BS bacon layered with fat.  They can get pretty busy. I have always waited for a table. However, the wait is not usually more than 15 minutes.  There is tons of available parking if you know where to look.  Just go to the West side blocks off Woodward."
4 star rating,"Well.. this place is pretty pricey for what you get. When I went here, and got a salad with a drink, the salad was near 12 dollars, but I could get on equivalent in quantity and quality at a place near my house for 2/3 the price.The drinks taste on par with all the other restaurants near by,  but the view and the experience is what makes the trip.The quantity of food you get is what made it two starts instead of three. So far, this is one of the few places I left hungry, but I am the piggy type :P"
2 star rating,"I've been sooo sad lately with my picks, but I felt good about Dime Store.  They were out of the beer I wanted, but the bloody mary had an enormous pickle so redemption was swift.The menu is interesting.  There was a lot I wanted to try, same with my husband.  It was early so he went with breakfast.  I had a lunch choice.  Honestly, both were great.  I can't say anything that hasn't already been said.Most everything seemed to be a hit, the service is swift and with a smile. I'll come back, sounds like there is a printed vegan menu..."
5 star rating,"Came here today around 2:15pm with my boyfriend and two friends. We didn't wait long to be seated, around 5 minutes. Service was great. A bit too crowded for my taste. Seated in an awkward arrangement near the window. I was really looking forward to this place, especially after having seen snapchats and various posts by friends. Unfortunately this place did not live up to the hype. I ordered the build-your-own omelette, as did my boyfriend, and we got an order of the brioche French toast and a beer-mosa. He enjoyed his omelette. Mine was made with egg whites and came out very watery. The potatoes were good. The beer-mosa was pretty good.The brioche French toast was a huge let down. I've had much better French toast at most mom-n-pop diners. It was very dry with very little flavor. We also got an order of the house fries. Not bad, but also not great.Friend 1 got the salad with salmon on it. She enjoyed it. Friend 2 got the eggs Benedict with turkey sausage and enjoyed it as well. Overall the food isn't horrible, just not WOW for the price you pay."
3 star rating,"I hate chains. Whenever I travel, I seek out locally owned establishments doing food well and/or doing interesting things with food. So when a need to travel back ""home"" to Detroit, Dime Store seemed an interesting choice for breakfast. The place has a groovy, fun and welcoming vibe despite its location in the interior of an office building. Dime store offers table seating and bar seating in front of the grill. Unfortunately, the view of the kitchen is obstructed for bar patrons; being able to watch the very efficient short-order team work their magic would be an added bonus to the charm of Dime Store. The service was attentive and thorough. Dime Store has been open for three years but it feels like it's been there forever.  The true reason to seek out Dime Store though is the food. This stuff is stupid good. It's gourmet meets street food meets tradition on a level that leaves you asking both ""why didn't I think of that"" and ""can I have a second order to go, please?"". I had the Spicy Belly Bennys. Think Eggs Benedict but with biscuits rather than English Muffins, Pork Belly instead of Canadian Bacon and a schmear of Jalapeño pesto instead of no Jalapeño pesto. I am convinced this was the result of a religious experience. God himself or the Virgin Mother must have played a role in this dish; it's that good.  This place is outstanding. I will definitely return!"
5 star rating,"Dime Store is my go-to brunch spot Downtown. Love the variety of drink options and the daily specials! I've tried several menu items now and enjoyed them all - I think the Duck Bop Hash is my favorite. I wish the Benedicts were a little bigger portion, but if I order a side of potatoes it's always enough food.If you come on a Saturday or Sunday, be prepared to wait a while. In my experience, the host/hostess is not always accurate when quoting wait times - I once waited over an hour when I was originally told 30 mins. Knowing this, I usually stop by and put my name in then swing by the Roasting Plant or Dessert Oasis for a coffee and then come back to wait. The wait is worth it!"
4 star rating,"Really nice place! Customer Service was excellent! Ordered the spicy Korean fries, corn beef hash & bacon apple waffles. All taste pretty good! I am really sad that I didn't get the large size of the fries, I'm craving them now!!"
4 star rating,"One of our favorite weekend activities is walking around downtown Detroit, checking out street art and eating good food. The Dine Store is a perfect location, inside a beautiful building, close to the action of city center. We met our son and friends for a Saturday brunch. Wait was a reasonable 20-minutes. The ambiance was lively and inviting. Wait staff very attentive and friendly. We had a variety of entrees at our table, and everyone was very satisfied. I selected the eggs Benedict with house potatoes. Perfectly prepared, beautifully presented, and delicious in every way. All the ingredients in the egg dishes were very fresh, locally sourced. We will definitely return to try other offerings."
5 star rating,Pretty good food. Nice atmosphere but very loud. They could stand to install some acoustic tiles on the ceiling
4 star rating,"I love coming here for breakfast during the week, the bartenders are fun to talk to and the service is great. As far as the food goes, you really can't go wrong with ordering. The weekend is expectedly packed unless you get there before 9, but the lobby is nice to sit and wait in, or head over to Bon Bon Bon for chocolates or Drought for some juice while you wait."
4.5 star rating,"Excellent food, but a very small restaurant. Couldn't seat very many people. Lengthy wait times."
4 star rating,"We went to the Dime Store for Sunday brunch on my birthday. It looked pretty packed when we arrived, and we were told there would be a 20 minute wait, which isn't bad at all. Turns out we only waited about 5 minutes before our name was called, and we got a great table by the huge windows. There was a Pride Parade going on, so we got to see it all! It was awesome.Our server was very nice and energetic, and the food itself was great. I had the chocolate thunder french toast (I think that's what it was called?) which came with a chocolate cream, a pistachio cream, and a blackberry whipped cream. I didn't care for the blackberry whipped cream, but the pistachio was amazing. My husband had the veggie omelette, which was also yummy, and came with a TON of potatoes--score. The decor is lovely, but the music was a very boring house beat that never seemed to change. Not sure if that's how it always is, but it got annoying after a while! Other than that, this is a great brunch spot."
4 star rating,Good vibes and atmosphere. Food was great highly recommend the strawberry French toast.
4 star rating,"I'd give this place 5 stars, but the waiting was excessive. 35 minutes to be seated followed by about another 30 minutes for food. It was all delicious and worth the wait, but it would've been nice to eat sooner than an hour after arriving.I got the salmon eggs benedict. It was so light yet filling. I ate it last because everything else I ordered was pretty heavy. My spouse got the pulled bbq hash, which I helped myself to. It was fantastic, and quite a large serving. They sweetness of the bbq paired with the savory potatoes and creamy egg- fantastic. We shared half orders of the spicy korean french fries and parmesean bacon fries. They were both good, but it was way too much potato (our own fault). The spicy korean fries were good, but needed a little more everything- sauce, pickled veggies, and shaved beef. After you eat about a quarter of the fries, there's nothing but plain french fries. A solid bfast spot!"
4 star rating,Pros: It's in Detroit! I have not had any problems with staff. The atmosphere has a bunch of good vibes. The food is the reason why I keep coming back here. It just might be my favorite breakfast joint!Cons: Sometimes there's a wait (it's not the biggest space) but it's always been worth it.
5 star rating,"When my girl friends were in town, this was my go to place for a boozy brunch! The girls got a hash and quiche. I opted for the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. All the food was super delicious and fresh! We also got our mimosas, and Bloody Mary's which went great with our food. I highly recommend doing breakfast, brunch, or lunch here!"
4 star rating,"Great food, modern and fun atmosphere, and good drink specials. The pork burger and side of brussels sprouts are a must try."
4 star rating,"Awesome drinks, food and service. Went on recommendations of the bar tender and everything was fantastic. A Detroit gem!"
5 star rating,Highly recommended.  Great food. Great staff. Great atmosphere. I have not been disappointed with the quality/perception/taste of the food; I went outside my comfort zone and tried multiple dishes and they were all delicious. Only down side is the wait - which typically means the food is excellent.
5 star rating,"This was our first stop during our extended weekend in Detroit. Amazing brunch! Definitely recommend the peach mimosas and cold brew coffee. The food was amazing, but more even more so the company was wonderful. We sat at the bar and got to chat with Big Mike (the bartender). Not only was he cheerful and welcoming, he gave us a bunch of great recommendations on places to check out in the city (and great stops for a drink or two). Our trip to Detroit has been amazing so far and it all started with Big Mike's warm welcome! If you are looking for a tasty breakfast or a boozy brunch, this is the place to stop in at!"
5 star rating,"Great food, great music, great service! We visited just before they were closing for a private event yet they still made us feel welcome and unrushed. I'd highly reccomend!"
4.5 star rating,I loved breakfast here. The food was delicious and the selection of hot tea was also wonderful. I had the vegetarian omelet and swapped in goat cheese. Delicious!
5 star rating,"Excellent breakfast. I highly recommend the Duck Bop Hash. It's has a mildly spicy tang to the sauce that surprised me but made me come back for a second visit. Normally, when traveling I won't do that but these guys do it right. The service has always been really good as well. Chill environment and a great way to start the day."
5 star rating,One of my favorite lunch spots in town. You can expect a wait if you go at the standard lunch hour. Korean sandwich and pear salad are my go-to's.
4 star rating,One of my top 10 restaurants in the city. The food here is always on point and the drinks are even better. Get the Korean bbq fries. You won't be sorry!
4 star rating,"My food was really delicious!!! I had the French toast w turkey sausage and my husband had an omelette w turkey sausage, veggies, and cheese. We absolutely loved it!!! My food was cold when they brought it out but the waitress didn't have a problem heating it for me. She was great!! I don't remember her name but it was a very pleasant experience."
4 star rating,"One of my favorite brunch spots in the city. I'll admit, it took me a while to make it here because I thought it was like, touristy or something, but then I realized I was being a jerk and now I've never looked back. I've only been on Sundaze because parking is both a breeze and free (as long as there isn't a sports thing happening)! I've always had to wait, but I mean, it's brunch, so waiting is expected. The last time I DIDN'T wait when going out for brunch I had a terrible meal, so let's assume there is a wait because it is so dang good. Mimosas are great and champagne heavy, even if a bit pricey. I ordered the Cuban the first time I came and it was on point! I also ordered the cauliflower soup on this visit which was creamy and flavorful and not too salty. Annnnnnd they served it in a coffee mug, which is totally my style. The second time I came I ordered a breakfast sandwich which came with a side salad. Both were good and I was happy I didn't get potatoes on top of the sandwich because that would have left me feeling lousy. They have a good sized menu and still so much I've not tried yet, so I've gotta make it back. I've told some of my co-workers who don't often venture to the city for eats, and they've gone and loved it as well!"
4 star rating,Theres a wait for a reason people. This place is out of the park for brunching. Amazing food and great drinks!
5 star rating,We were in town for the Detroit half marathon and were looking for a good way to carbo load for the next day.  We certainly picked the right place!  Portions here are very large.  I would recommend many of the sandwiches but our favorites were the duck confit Reuben sandwich and the PBLT - pork belly lettuce and tomato.  The winner of the meal though was the bulgolgi fries- perfectly marinated and grilled beef on top of a pile of crispy fries.  Get the full order to share or make it a stand alone meal- it's that huge.
4 star rating,"I love their food! Literally everything is amazing, I love their sauce for the egg benny! So yummy! But one thing was that it was so tight to sit in there but that don't matter as of now, because it is in downtown so it will be busy!"
5 star rating,"This place is great! A great little brunch spot that has great food and booze as well. I went here while wrapping up a quick weekend vacation in Detroit, and I will return whenever I'm back in the area, highly recommended!"
4.5 star rating,"My husband and I visited here for the first time at the recommendation of a good friend.  It was incredible!!  We both ordered a special, I had the peach crisp french toast and he had an omelet.  Both were delicious!  We sat at the counter at the far end where we could watch the staff cook and prepare the amazing dishes.  We can't wait to go back and try some others!  A big shout out to our waiter, Antonio, he spent a lot of time with us telling us interesting things about the place.  Look for the hidden old dimes in the walls!"

Unfortunately it wasn't.... The steak had no flavor and they used American yellow cheese on it...ewww my sister ordered a chicken sandwich and it was very dry. My latte was served room temp ewww.... If it wasn't for the waitress being super sweet I would probably give this place zero stars based on food and drink alone. I will try it out again and update until then two stars from me."
2 star rating,"Tried Dime Store for breakfast and loved it! It was small and had a nice laid back atmosphere.  The waitress was very friendly and explained their menu choices since it was our first time.  I had a cappuccino and it was delicious! For breakfast I had the smoked salmon sandwich and it also did not disappoint.  I liked that the sandwich came with a side salad.  It is nice to be able to get more healthy options for breakfast.  My husband who does not go for the healthy options also loved his waffles, bacon, and potatoes. All in all we were glad we tried it and will go back!"
5 star rating,Nice menu.  Really friendly people there. The burgers looked awesome.  I wanted something lighter though and got the salmon salad.  It was really tasty.  Loved the dressing.  Walking distance from Cobo so good for conference goers.

4 star rating,"Love this place.  Cozy atmosphere and very helpful staff.  I like sitting at the counter in front of the kitchen - the staff is fun to interact with and it's cool to watch them work.I had the waffle special with strawberries and jam, and it rocked.  Coffee was good too.  My wife had an omelette and loved it.  Get there early, though, the place is small and gets packed quickly."
4.5 star rating,Great place will return. Such interesting entrees. Wanted to try everything. My ONLY issue was all of our food was kinda cold. Our soup was Luke warm. I let the server know. It could happen. But then our food was kinda cold too. I don't know why. I don't think our food was waiting up there for a while. Wasn't that busy.
4 star rating,"Fantastic service, the servers are always super friendly and helpful. Food is always delicious. One of my favorite spots in Detroit to do brunch."
5 star rating,Went here for Sunday brunch and loved it!  I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict & my husband had the duck ruben.  Both were absolutely delicious.  I can't wait to go back!
5 star rating,"Been here before and love it every time!! The yogurt with honey granola , strawberry, blueberries.. soooo healthy & perfect. I can't wait to make that at home every day.

5 star rating,"This is the best breakfast in Detroit - not even close!  Every time I come to the D I stop on this place for breakfast not just once...but every. single. day.  This time I got the jerk chicken hash which was on the specials menu. The chicken was moist and seasoned to perfection with flavorful crispy potatoes, poached eggs, peppers, and avocado crema.  So delicious. I was sitting at the bar licking my chops.  Next day - French toast...like outstanding French toast.  With reap maple syrup. Next day, a sausage, egg breakfast Sammy.  The sausage is homemade and so delicious. It makes the sandwich.  The bread is soft and the eggs are cooked to perfection. I wish I could say every breakfast spot should know how to cook eggs but sadly that is not always the case. This restaurant does the classics really well and made fresh and they also know how to bring in some innovative dishes like that jerk chicken hash. This is one of the best in the D so do yourself a favor and make time to visit this spot if you are in downtown Detroit."
4.5 star rating,"Good portion, fresh ingredients, nice staffs. Here really brighten my first day in Detroit."
5 star rating,Food is consistently good. The menu options are limited as you would expect from a gastropub focused on quality. The service has always been amazing.
5 star rating,"I met some old friends here for brunch on a Saturday around noon.  The wait was 1.5 hours, however the food and the atmosphere were great.  The owners need to consider expanding the restaurant due to it being very small."
4 star rating,First time here. It was delicious! Had the Canolli waffle and although I was concerned it may be too sweet it was just perfect! Can't wait to come back and try another creation
4 star rating,"My family met up with some other family members. We enjoyed our meals here. The menu is very small, but the food is really good!"
4 star rating,"First time here and it was amazing. Great atmosphere and a diverse menu. Try the duck hash, combination of classic American breakfast with Korean BBQ sauce - delicious."
5 star rating,Fresh young scene! Food was excellent. Peach mimosa was the best! Staff was friendly. Definitely a must
5 star rating,"We went on the weekend and as such, it was pretty busy and there was a 30 minute-ish wait. Went with some friends. Usually, I hate brunch. I have celiac disease and brunch used to be such a delicious fun time but now I can never eat anything except an omelette when what I really want is all the bread in the world, in my mouth. But I digress! Anyway, this was an awesome brunch. Our server was knowledgeable and they have delicious GF options. Yes, I got an omelette. But I could eat the potatoes! Which were amazing! AND while the omelette usually comes with some type of bread on the side which I said I did not want, our server kindly offered to bring me tomato slices instead since I couldn't eat the bread. Few places offer to do that when you have to decline some bread option that you know you're paying for anyway, and it was really nice of her to do that. We will definitely be back."
5 star rating,"We walked over from our hotel for breakfast, and believe me it was worth the walk.  My son and I got the cheesesteak benny and it was delicious.  My other son got the churro waffles and he loved them.  My wife got a salmon sandwich and she cleaned her plate.  I also got a Bloody Mary that had the most refreshing pickle I have ever had and my wife got a peach mimosa that was also very good.  Overall, I would definitely go back if we get back up to the Detroit area."
5 star rating,"Although this is my first review, I use yelp for everything! So when I saw the reviews for the Dime Store, me a my girlfriend had to check it out. The Dime Store exceed all expectations! The food was absolutely amazing! I had the Spicy Belly Benny with breakfast potatoes and it was hands down the best thing I have ever eaten. The service and atmosphere were also top notch. Whenever we visit Detroit again, we will be sure to make a stop at the Dime Store."
4.5 star rating,"Food is good, really good. Brunch or lunch, never has failed to please. They have a Happy Hour, the drinks are just okay, but the prices of drinks are nice and the food just doesn't ever disappoint."
4 star rating,Ok I have never ate none of there food but listen here they have some of the best cookies ever yall should really check them out.
3 star rating,"Excellent brunch! Food is fantastic. Only been once, and we sat at the bar which was pretty quick. Although I have seen people wait for a while, I would say it's worth it."
5 star rating,"We had breakfast here before leaving the city, and it was so good that we may have to make a special trip back just to eat here again. The food was simply amazing. I had the corn beef benny, and ate every single bite. I never would have considered having sourkraut at breakfast, but it absolutely worked. My wife got the churro waffle, and it was the delicious as well. The staff was friendly and helpful, and we will definitely be going back next time we are in Detroit."
5 star rating,After a 10 minute wait on a Saturday around noon we had a fantastic meal. Efficient service. Everything had a spectacular flavor. Lots to choose from. Fresh ingredients. Use local ingredients and vendors. Definite worth the time and drive.
4 star rating,"Staff, service, ambience, food all superb! The bacon apple waffle was killer. I would Highly recommend this spot. A+ boys!"
5 star rating,A friend invited me to lunch here so I figured why not. It's definitely not your typical place. They put creative spins on fry's and even have a duck Reuben . I had the cheese steak which was really good but a little small compared to most places. I forget what they call the special fries with Korean beef on top but they are amazing . That was my favorite part of lunch. Pretty cool decor and a lunch counter kind of vibe. Worth checking out.
4 star rating,"Came here for lunch today, but was easily tempted by their breakfast menu.  I love having the option for brunch during the week days, rather than waiting for it on the weekends.  Ordered their new chicken salad sandwich and my brother had their grilled chicken salad.  Both were fantastic.  Also had the cauliflower soup, which i'd highly recommend.  I noticed they have a full bar too which is a plus.  Am definitely planning on coming back."
5 star rating,"Best food/ambience/price combination I've experienced during my stay here in Detroit. The chili cheese fries and especially the duck bop hash are amazing! Sitting at the kitchen counter is a great experience, being continuously teased by the stream of fresh and delicious food coming out of the kitchen!"
5 star rating,"So excited about going back soon!  We want to try many more things.  Everything was soo good!  Long wait to get a table, but the lobby was so amazingly beautiful and very comfortable that we did not mind the wait.  So glad Detroit is getting more and more places like this!"
4.5 star rating,Very good service and very friendly. Burger was pretty good but $15 for just a burger does not come with anything. Mac & cheese not my favorite either.
3 star rating,Go early or be prepared to wait at this popular spot! Well worth the wait and well deserved reputation.  Great casual diverse and trendy vibe. Attentive efficient service even with the maddening excited Brunch crowd.  Benedicts that look good and taste heartily delicious! We will go back once we make it through the other new inventive breakfast places springing up in Detroit like daffodils!
5 star rating,"The Cheesesteak Benny was delicious and I thought the Mac and cheese (with broccoli and bacon) was good. The Benny was quite flavorful; however, the Mac and cheese might be a bit bland for many. I prefer it somewhat bland. I'm not so sure of the other choices: truffle fries and the sausage omelette. The fries were dry so I picked the  pieces that was covered in cheese and bacon. The wait was long for a weekend and the place was a bit claustrophobic. It did not make for an enjoyable brunch."
3 star rating,I love love love eating here. Did I mention I love it here? The food and service is so damn good. Like how can you give this place anything less than 5 stars? I'm not even going to tell you what I ate the few times I've eaten here because everything on the menu is delicious. Just go and see for yourself.
5 star rating,"The joint is inside an office building. A small space for a party of 8 we waited about 45 minutes. As for food everything on the menu looked delicious. I got the duck bop hash which comes with two fried eggs, the flavoring and texture was awesome. Although i thought the duck tasted more like pork. The sausage hash looked amazing though with a huge piece of avocado on top. Service was on point we got our food reasonably quickly. Will def come back again but with less people. It looks like there is always a 20+ minute unless you are a party of 2."
4 star rating,"We loved the atmosphere, eclectic urbran.  We enjoyed our omelettes, but they were out of the Belgian waffle which was a disappointment. Anyways, great brunch spot.For more reviews, check out my blog!"
4 star rating,"Awesome brunch or lunch spot. The food was different but didn't stray too far from popular menu items at places like this. I had the General Tso's Benny, which was fantastic! And I sat at the bar and watched all sorts of food get prepared. They were efficient, thorough, and every plate looked delicious. Would recommend to anyone!"
5 star rating,"Had wanted to try this place for a while, after hearing such great things. Considering everything in Detroit is trendy now, I knew there would be a brunch wait and was fine with that. My party of 3 sat at the bar facing the kitchen. Not ideal but it was fine. Uncomfortable having to constantly turn around for the waitress, meaning constantly bumping into the person next to me, but a busy atmosphere must mean this place is doing something right. Right? Ordered a coffee and Bloody Mary to start things off. The coffee was good. The Bloody Mary was so incredibly average. For a brunch spot, I don't know but I expect a drink with some verve. Instead, a watery drink with a limp pickle. Meh. For my meal, I ordered an omelet with house fries. Both so underwhelming, that I don't even remember what the omelet had in it. The house fries are terrible. Bland, flavorless tiny pieces of potato. No seasoning, maybe throw an onion or two in there. Nothing. Just dry, tasteless nuggets. Came with one piece of toast cut in half, so it looked like two pieces of toast. LOL Weird. The rest of my party was overall okay with their orders. Both agreed though, wouldn't probably rush back. The atmosphere is very hipster-ish but not pretentious. I actually liked the hustle being seated by the open kitchen. Just wish the food wasn't so darn average. Better eats many other places. Better Bloody Mary's pretty much anywhere. Probably won't be back. If I do come back, it won't be because I'm paying.3 stars for ambiance and potential but this place has been around a while, maybe it's already reached it."
3 star rating,Great food and good service. Bacon avocado omelet was fantastic.i would definitely go here again.
5 star rating,"If you've ever been to DIME, then you know it really doesn't require a review. EVERYTHING is delicious! The seating area is tight...very close quarters... but very worth it for the food! I recommend getting there as early as possible because this place stays busy."
4.5 star rating,Cute little spot in downtown Detroit! It was really hard to choose what to eat-everything sounded great! I went with a coffee and the chicken salad sandwich and fries with truffle mayo. It was delicious. The staff was friendly and made me feel at home. Would definitely come back!
5 star rating,"Many friends kept saying how much they liked this place, so I thought I'd give it another try. I as pleasantly surprised. I had a much better experience the second time around. My food was really good. My wife wasn't super happy with her meal though.I got a breakfast dish this time and it was way better. My wife didn't get breakfast. So I would have to suggest getting a breakfast dish if you come here.I also walked by this place around lunch time one Saturday and there was about 30 people waiting to be seated. So it's clearly popular."
4 star rating,"Had lunch here on a Friday. We got there before the rush, so service was very good. I got the Beets and Squash Sandwich with a Side Salad. The sandwich was good except the bread to content ratio was a bit skewed more towards the bread than I'd like. The side salad wasn't very good; I found the dressing to be quite sour. Would like to try there breakfast sometime still though."
3 star rating,"Had vegetarian omelet with side salad, pork sausage, and black coffee. Omelet was good but too much butter, salad was highly acidic, and pork sausage wasn't really a sausage instead small piece of meat patty. Kinda disappointed in the ""sausage"" concept."
3 star rating,"What a fantastic place! We had brunch after going to Karmanos. The food was delicious! Big Mike was so good to us too. If you want great food and a cool atmosphere, this is it."
5 star rating,"Easily the Best Breakfast I've had and we travelA lot. Best Benny's and Insane FrenchToast EVER!!!!! Real maple syrup, Real Bacon like my parents farm!!!! Definitely go here."
5 star rating,"After deciding to play hooky from work, we went here for a Friday morning Brunch. The food was great and I enjoyed the atmosphere. The waiter was very attentive and refilled our Mimosas immediately upon finishing them.. If you're into truffle, the truffle fries are as good as it gets.The only reason this got 4 stars instead of 5 was because the hostess seemed clueless... The place was only about half-full and she tried to sit us at a 2-top which was connected to a 4-top that was fully occupied... The people that were sitting there looked at us like, ""are you serious??"" After a brief, ""um we're not sitting here ma'am"", it was rectified but still very weird."
4 star rating,The breakfast here is different and really good. Service was surprisingly fast good given that every single table seems to be always full.
5 star rating,"Small place. We got there 10 am. No wait. When we left at 11 am, there were probably 30 people waiting in the lobby. I loved my smoked salmon eggs Benedict with arugula salad. My dining companion felt the omelette was too small for the price, and said the cubed potatoes were disgusting ""like the stuff you get at BigBoy"".I liked the crowded little urban atmosphere. I thought the service was very good. I would've given it 4 stars, but due to my companion's unhappiness with his meal, I have to give it three. However, I will try it again.... With a new dining companion."
3 star rating,The Dime Store is an excellent choice for breakfast or lunch. The menu has traditional favorites with a twist.  I experienced its Sunday brunch and came away wanting more.  The Cheesesteak Benedict was excellent and my son said his avocado and bacon omelette was the best he had ever had.  Get here early. It is a very small place but that makes it perfect.
5 star rating,"Really feels like downtown Detroit is back! Dime store was packed on a sunny Thursday afternoon. 1st. Time here. Shared a duck Reuben along with Korean beef sandwich. Both were excellent ! Service excellent as well. Drinks refilled before even empty. Even the pickle that came with sandwiches had a unique flavor. Only thing keeping me from 5th star was the price $32  4 the two sandwiches, 1 ice tea and tip."
4.5 star rating,"Yummy brunch place. Excellent eggs Benedict and the loaded fries (I tried the bacon, parmesan and truffle fries) are delicious.Don't be in a rush, there will be a wait on the weekend."
5 star rating,"Tourist in my own city kind of experience. The look and feel is hipster but it earns it's place among those worthy of anyones money. The menu is not eclectic just for the sheer purpose of being different they have ingredients and dishes that are honestly creative that will bring people back. I ordered a classic waffle and bacon. I should not have. My friends, on adventure, ordered omelettes and hash that I tried. My waffle was great but I'm doing a disservice to my tastebuds and body by ordering batter and fat. They have real ingredients, real sausage, real cheese, real herbs, real sauces, real jams, fresh breads, there's real food here. They serve drinks, creative spins on classics. The Bloody Mary was made with hands, not a mix from Costco. They also, to my pleasure, have Beermosas! I don't care much for champagne (sham-pagnee) so this hit the spot.I would like to see more reasonable pricing but this is a nice treat and is probably relative to the income and crowd in Downtown Detroit..... Edit I take that back, the pricing is reasonable you get what you pay for."
4 star rating,"Not bad! This is a cute little place that's somewhat hidden downtown. I've been there twice and both times ordered the brussel sprout + bacon salad. It's a pretty solid choice! I recommend getting fries on the size though, because I'm sort of a carb fiend. Overall the prices are very reasonable for a downtown sit-down lunch or casual dinner place. The seating is pretty cool - they look like they were salvaged from an old ball park or something like that.  One thing I've noticed though is they are very frequently out of stock on their more interesting beers, which can be disappointing. Other than that, no complaints."
4 star rating,"One of the best brunch spots in Detroit. The wait especially on weekends is crazy though, I would recommend going closer to closing or on the weekdays. Really good omelets!"
4 star rating,"Absolutely delicious! Went for breakfast on a Saturday morning where there was a small wait however it was completely worth it. I ordered, and ate, one of the omelettes which comes with home fries that could be a dish alone. Everything was cooked to perfection, including the French toast I tasted a friend ordered. Highly recommend even if there is a wait."
5 star rating,"I loved this place! It was super packed and we had a little bit of a wait but it was worth it. Very small, you almost feel crammed. Service was friendly and attentive, really liked the waffle, flavorful and a crispy-ness. Oatmeal was good, big serving. Bacon and white cheddar omelette was really really good but I wasn't a fan of the breakfast potatoes. I'd go back!"
4 star rating,"Yum, all I can say is yum. Came here for breakfast, split a special of the day french toast and the camote smash. All I can say is, what wonderful flavor! My taste buds were exploding with both dishes. The menu seems like it had some thing for everyone. I can tell this place is busy, but they kept a good flow with their seating. I can't wait to come back and try more off the menu."
4 star rating,"I'm a ""breakfast guy"" and have been to some great joints. This was the best breakfast we've ever had. Omelettes were amazing. Service fantastic. All around great experience."
5 star rating,"Lovely menu, friendly staff, delicious food - and the unexpectedly wonderful benefit of taking your coffee to go at the end of your meal."
5 star rating,"Literally the best place to take your vaporwave bandmates to brunch after a late show. Just, try to drag yourselves in before 3PM on the weekends, ok?Food was amazing, service was great, the whole experience was worth the wait, which was significant due to the size and popularity of the place.Definitely on our repeat list. But I gotta work on my synth chops first."
4.5 star rating,"Went for brunch and waited 20 minstrel, what I expected. Once sat, our server was attentive considering how busy it was through out our meal. I had the the duck bop hash with a side of the spicy Korean fries. I recommend both but perhaps not together...they share similar ingredients but are delicious nonetheless."
5 star rating,This is a pretty damn fantastic restaurant. The line was a little bit I was there on a day of the marathon so completely understandable. I would definitely say it's worth the money and the food was outstanding. I give this restaurant 3/4 erect! The Chubb was starting from this food.
4 star rating,"I had high hopes for this place especially since I waited twice for over an hour to eat here. I was disappointed. I had the Croque Madame Benny and was not impressed, the potatoes were completely cold and the Benny had very little flavor. The Mac n cheese tasted like a bad version of boxed Mac and cheese and the truffle fries were very thick cut which I'm not a fan of, and soggy. The blueberry French toast was the best part of the meal and it was sub par. I would recommend trying this place out if you're a mediocre foodie but for me, it just didn't satisfy any of my ""tooth's"" and was just okay."
2 star rating,They have amazing brunch! Definitely recommend the duck hash. It is priced more for a treat then an everyday breakfast but is SO worth it. Have been here several times but recently came for my birthday brunch. Because the place is smaller I wasn't sure how it would work out but they were more than accommodating giving us the large table in the corner. (It almost looks like a private room.) Service is always excellent with friendly waitstaff. The location and decor/ overall feel is perfect for Downtown Detroit. Definitely would recommend this spot to anyone.
5 star rating,"Great place for breakfast/brunch! I came here with a couple of my friends so I was able to sample quite a bit of the menu. The food was good, but nothing spectacular. We ordered the salmon benedict, veggie hash, sausage omelet, and truffle fries. The food came out at a decent time, but our waiter wasn't attentive to us because of the busy state of the restaurant. We had to flag him down a couple of times for refills on water and for ketchup.  Although the service could be better, the menu was a lot cheaper than I thought it would be so that was a plus! And the interior is well designed! I really like the modern twist with the ""dime store"" sign in neon lights. Overall, I'd come here again for a nice brunch date :)"
3 star rating,"We went here for brunch on Sunday and place looked good very busy spot wait was about 45 mins ,I had the Seared Brussels sprouts salad and the cauliflower gruyere and I loved the soup and my salad was So so it was very grease couldn't eat it as much . Probably will go back just to try the breakfast"
3 star rating,"This place was great! I was eating alone on a business trip and decided to follow the positive yelp reviews here for saturday morning brunch. There was a 30 minute wait but they were able to seat me within minutes of putting my name down. The spot is crowded, but I didn't mind. Service was impeccable and I got my drink (SUPER delicious breakfast old fashioned) and food (breakfast sandwich) insanely fast. I was very happy with the food, drink, service and space."
5 star rating,Nicole the hostess gave us an accurate time for waiting!  Great food great staff....never a disappointment
5 star rating,"We were visiting from miami and found this place on yelp. It was spectacular! We had the cheesesteak Benny which is eggs Benedict with shaved steak, a pblt which is a pork belly lettuce and tomato sand which and a Korean BBQ sandwich. They were all fantastic. The Korean BBQ had a spicy sweet taste that was unique. I told the owner that he must open in miami. We had great service. Everyone was nice. Don't miss it! Very unique menu."
5 star rating,Amazing find. We were in town for the weekend visiting on business and found them on yelp. One word: Ridiculous! The staff was very friendly and the food was amazing. Have to try out the steak Benny! The Korean bbq sandwich was also great!
4.5 star rating,"Long wait for the table, but good food! It's small and crowed so it might not be ideal for a large group unless you call ahead. The food is relatively cheaper than alot of other options downtown."
4 star rating,"The Duck Bop Hash is very good, though a little bit too spicy. Staff team is very supportive."
5 star rating,"Great place with terrible parking :) I love there food and beverages here. The staff is always nice and helpful, and the food is delicious. I am a favorite of the breakfast sammie with no meat, avocado and tomato. They always give you a salad as a side with the sandwich, which is awesome. The dressing is lovely, a light and tangy delight that makes your taste buds dance. I love their bloody mary's, but then again, I love everyone's bloody mary's. Parking is a ""B"", so be aware that you need to always search for legal parking as the meter maid is always out and about ready to write you up."
4 star rating,"Great menu! Great ambiance! Great service! Great food!I ordered the veggie omelet and it satisfies this this omnivores needs: fluffy egg, big veggies, meaty mushrooms! Great for vegetarians.Looking forward to a cheat day when I can try the duck Reuben, house-made sausage, and pork belly Benny!"
5 star rating,"Just got a carry-out order of the korean bbq sandwich and wow...one of the better sandwiches I've had recently. The flavor of the shredded ribeye is amazing, and it's paired perfectly with shredded carrot and cucumber for a good crunch in the sandwich and a good mix of sweet but well-balanced flavor. Even the bun it was served on tastes great. The sandwiches are very reasonably priced at about $7-$9 on average, with the high end being an $11 duck reuben. My friend got the fries which I sampled and were also very good and hand-cut. Granted it's newly opened, but the wait staff was extremely polite while I waited for my carry out order, offered water while I waited and thanked us a few times for visiting. I'll definitely be coming back, especially for brunch once their liquor license goes through."
5 star rating,Really great casual breakfast spot in the Chrysler House with above average breakfast and lunch. Smoked salmon Benny and Duck Bop Hash were delicious. Nitro coffee is exactly what you want in cold brew. Pure yummy coffee flavor. Bloody Mary was good but not pretty basic. The place was full but no one waited long. I will definitely go back.
4 star rating,Very very good. We got there early on a Sunday morning (9:30 ish) and not a big wait. The Benny was very good and the hash was as well. Pitchers of mimosas!!!!!!
5 star rating,"I LOVE this place. They serve breakfast all day and have awesome mimosas and beermosas!It doesn't stop there! If I could stay there all day to work and eat, I would. They have amazing salads and sandwiches too. I had the PBLT (Pork Belly, Lettuce, Tomato) sandwich. It was a-mazing!Last thing: Do not leave there without having a basket of fries with their truffle mayo."
4 star rating,"I ate here one time and was completely disappointed.  I paid almost $11 for a grilled cheese that was all bread with a thin slice of what appeared to be a Kraft single slice of cheese, looking like it was slapped together but they missed so it was all crooked, and it was cold.  That was about 8 months ago... I was thinking of giving it another shot since we all have off days.. that is until my co-worker ordered a grilled cheese a few days ago and it looked just like the one I got 8 months ago, down to the barely there cheese on texas toast, slapped together, and cold.  I watched her take one bite and throw it back into the box in disgust."
1 star rating,"I think the hipsters might have this place overrated.  It's a pain to find parking although they will validate if you park in the financial district garage which is nice.  Food was fine ,not awesome . Prices were moderate and the interior is rustic and dated.  Seemed dirty and worn down.  Staff was friendly ."
4.5 star rating,"The wait was worthwhile, but I'll lead off by saying it was the wait from when we sat down until we were served our food that marks this a four star experience. I can understand the wait outside, but perhaps the wait outside would move faster if the cooks could turn meals out more quickly once you are actually seated. I don't know--felt like an exceptionally long wait compared to regular dining experiences at other restaurants.Very friendly and professional staff. The duck scramble I got was very delicious with its Korean BBQ glaze--sweet and savory just mixed right into the fresh potatoes and eggs. Delicious! Enjoy the Bloody Mary, too, but was a bit mild."
4 star rating,Decent tasting food but severely overpriced for the shitty service and weak drinks we got. The small blonde waitress with short hair really needs to be taught about customer service. We had to seek her out twice because she never came by again on her own until it was time to collect the tab (which we had to get up to go find her to even get.) I wouldn't have minded the price if the service was decent but it really was terrible.
3 star rating,Friend and I stopped in for lunch after hearing about the good grub. Surprisingly unique food! The Korean dish was really good. There's a lot I want to try but can't eat it all. Definitely worth Stopping by. The decor is fine but the seating is a bit close for my comfort. Staff is friendly and trendy. Need to pee? It's out the door and around the corner. Kinda awkward but it is in a commercial building's lobby soooo...yeah.
4 star rating,"Went to this place on a whim and really liked it. The food was great and the atmosphere was great as well. Favorite thing about this place is that everyone was friendly. Originally was told that the wait would be 10 minutes but we only waited less than 5 minutes max for a table. Definitely does get packed and busy but wait times are not that bad, for small groups of people. Great experience, I will be returning."
5 star rating,"I had the truffle fries which was good, but the cashier took the liberty to tip herself and charge me more than I paid for the fries on my debit card. Won't be back...."
3 star rating,"Probably my favorite brunch ever!!!!! The wait to get in on sundays is probably an hour ++ so have a snack before you go if you're starving, but it is so so worth it!"
5 star rating,"Being a vegetarian, I used to love their butternut squash sandwich.  They removed from the menu. Left with a tasteless veggie burger and a grilled cheese.  The grilled cheese is fine, not award winning.  Their truffle fries are great. But not enough to make me want to lunch there a lot.  Prices are high but it is downtown Detroit.  If you have to lunch downtown and you're a veggie eater, look elsewhere."
3 star rating,I liked the decore cool seating. My girlfriend and I sat next to the window. The service was fast. I found it to be a bit pricey. But the restaurant is in downtown to I guess you can expect to pay a bit more. I had the French toast and it was good. The only thing I'd like to see change is the loud house music it's to much for breakfast.
4 star rating,"I liked the menu here- the Korean fries weren't too different than what else I've had, but the salad was very good as was the french toast. My boyfriend and I loved the coffee and the ambiance- and it wasn't badly priced. I'm sure we'll be back next time I'm in town."
4 star rating,"Tasty Brussel sprout salad.  Everything is pretty good.  The space is very small, crowded and noisy.  I prefer take out."
4.5 star rating,We met for a work breakfast and everyone had a great meal. Not a large place but very comfortable and in a great location close to many popular downtown attractions. Parking was not great but when is it in a downtown setting.
4 star rating,"We were referred here by American Coney Island, since they don't serve breakfast.  It's saying a lot that a competitor referred us here. Exceptional food!  The sausage is made in house, and the bread is fresh and moist. My party and I all had omelettes, and these were fantastic.The 80s music they play is phenomenal.  Great mix from my favorite era. One star off for bad coffee and horrible service from our server. The owner, Jeff, stepped in and did a great job compensating for her. I only found out he was the owner when I went to give him my server's tip (since he did ALL her work). He spent a long time talking with us, which is great. I highly recommend it."
4 star rating,"If you want brunch, just visit this place and you will never want brunch from anywhere else ever again. Get this, we came here with a party of 14, yeah freakin' 14! and they had us seated in less than 2 minutes! They were almost full already, but they managed, and they managed well. The customer service was exquisite. I asked the server for a suggestion, and she truly took my opinion of what she suggested to heart, and she did not steer me wrong at all. The portions are substantial. The ingredients are fresh, like hella fresh to death. There is a plate that has almost an entire freshly sliced avocado, and none of that extra-charge Chipotle BS, know what I'm say'n. It appears as if they only hired the most hard working staff they could ever find. These are the kind of hard workers that work I-might-poach-your-employees-for-an-industry-in-which-they-probably-have-no-experience hard. Even if the prices were $20/plate, which they aren't, it would be worth it for the overall experience that you receive at The Dime Store. Oh, and for those of you looking for bloodies, mimosas, and beermosas, they're on the menu as well."
5 star rating,Nice atmosphere...awesome bloody marys... but trying a bit too hard to make the food fancy. I mean biscuits and gravey doesn't come with chives on it for God's sake. And it's a bit expensive.
4 star rating,"Sometimes the cashier girl can be a little rude as she will keep you on hold when trying to place a take out order or keep you standing at the counter waiting on your order and act like she does not see you.  I actually hate when she is working by the way.  But, outside of her, and the fact that I don't even know if she still works there because I have not seen here in a while, I love the food.  The greek yogurt with a side of bacon fried crisp is my go to.  The brussel sprouts can be a tad bit too vinegar-y, but still palatable.  They need to ease up on the vinegar from time to time on those sprouts.  The omelets are good with the cubed hash browns and toast.  Yea, this is a cool place with good food.  I just cant stand that checkout girl."
3 star rating,"Not impressed. There were so many rules, I heard ""no, we can't do that"" for the first few questions. Despite my gut instinct to flee, we decided to go forward based on the reputation. The food was just as disappointing as the service. Not sure what people see in this place."
2 star rating,"Pretty cool place. Packed at 11:45am on a Saturday. There was a home Tigers game at 1pm so that probably played into it. Service was decent, no complaints. Liked the coffee. This review is mostly dedicated to the blandness of the sausage hash. It was yawn inducing. Plus it's $10. I feel that's a bit steep for mostly potatoes. I'll return to try something else. I'm in full support of more brunch spots in the city. I wonder if I'm missing something or people are just mega excited to have another food option."
3 star rating,"Get here early for brunch, there always seems to be an hour+ wait. Went there this morning, great food, but there was a hair in the marmalade that was served with the English muffin. The waiter was apologetic and gave us a 25% discount. I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt and try this place again."
4 star rating,The entree size mac n cheese loaded with bacon and brussel sprouts is bangin'!!! Good vibes inside but pretty small.
5 star rating,Came on a Saturday around 1pm for brunch with a party of four.  They quoted us a 30 mins wait but we were seated in about 20 mins.  The service was prompt and friendly. Drinks and food came out without delay.  Everyone was pleased and enjoyed their meals. Prices weren't terrible either. I recommend the Dime Store and will return whenever I'm back in the city.
4.5 star rating,"Absolutely one of the best brunches in the area.  Wish I lived closer by so I could go more often.  Have been a couple times, once sat at the counter by the kitchen which was great because we got to see all the action.  The next time was at a regular table and again service was spot on.  Food was fantastic.  If you get a chance give it a try as I believe you will be pleased."
5 star rating,"I ate there for the first time today, it definitely lived up to what I've read about it. I had a make your own omelette with onion, white cheddar cheese, and their house made sausage. The food smelled, looked, and tasted great. The sight of the dish was very appealing. Service was great, its a small place so be aware of what time you should go. But go!!"
5 star rating,"Go here. My bacon avocado omelette was delicious. My son's Spicy Belly was delicious. You may have to wait to be seated but it is worth it. If you are one of those people that whines about tight seating or loud places, maybe try elsewhere. The joint is small so they pack the tables in. No biggie, the food is worth it. I happened to be seated at the small bar section. We got to watch the organized chaos at the small grill area. More organized than chaos once we watched the flow. Made me want to give the cooks a tip. This is a place i will bring visitors that still think Detroit is the old corrupt shidhole from the last decade. Eat well my friends."
5 star rating,"The duck bop hash was delicious. Really have never had a breakfast dish like that before. I appreciate that they are doing something different with their dishes and will be back to try other items.Had to knock one star off because of the un-attentive server though. All in all, a great new addition to downtown. CheerZ"
4 star rating,Pork Belly Benny's ++ Very GoodDuck Bop Hash ++ Very GoodBrunch Drinks + GoodGood spot for breakfast/brunch on the weekends.  Small space so you may have to wait a little bit if you go after 9-10 AM.  Overall we enjoyed
4 star rating,"I really like this place. It's brunch with a twist. I have never been disappointed with my meal. It's kinda small, super busy and you will wait for a table. It's worth the wait."
4 star rating,The wait for the dime store can be nuts...I recommend getting your name on the list an taking a stroll around downtown Detroit. Atmosphere and food are great!
4 star rating,"Have been coming to Detroit for more than a 10 years and pretty avoided downtown during that period.  A good friend told me to check out the ""new Detroit"" and I was pretty much blown away.  Lot's of energy and a great collection of unique restaurants, bars and retail.  I went to Dime Store for lunch and the food lived up to the hype.  I had a pork hamburger and it was cooked to perfection, as were the french fries.  Great experience."
5 star rating,"One of the best spots downtown for brunch, in my opinion. Great variety of foods, not a menu a mile long to help fuel your indecision or worries of things not being fresh. And a decent selection to make your meals vegetarian or gluten free. It's worth the wait. And you can always curb your hunger or hangover by popping into Drought for some delicious cold pressed juices and shots, or Bon Bon Bon for some sweets."
5 star rating,"The hype is real! This place is delicious and worth the wait. Had a breakfast sandwich and waffles for the table and all were great. Especially the turkey sausage sandwich- one of the best I've ever had. Plus the server was SO nice, I wish I had her name to complement her. Great food and great service = five stars! I'll be back."
4.5 star rating,"While in Detroit a friend and I decided to check out Dime and let me just say that I was very impressed! Although it was very busy, my friend and I got seated right away! The menu was overwhelming in the best of ways, the options were endless and the dishes were anything but ordinary. The flavors were so complex and delightful and clearly made with care. The ingredients were very fresh and the fruit bowl was out of this world! If you are looking for a place that has brilliant flavors and a fun upbeat atmosphere, then Dime is the place for you."
5 star rating,"Awesome menu, had so many things I wanted but unfortunately only have 1 stomach to fit it all. It's a busy place so be prepared to wait a bit for a table. Luckily they are in the Chrysler house building and you can wait comfortably in the lobby."
5 star rating,"Duck confit, thick chunks of smokey bacon and buttery hash topped with a sunny side egg..need I say more? Needless, to say this tastes heavenly! I also sampled their salad with grilled chicken breast. The chicken was a little on the dry side but well seasoned and the dressing was quite good. The multigrain bread was very good; pillowy, slight chew and the taste of the grains really pull through.Their coffee on the other hand....was extremely disappointing. They touted the fact that it's locally roasted by one of the indie roasters but it was quite stale. It lacked body, very acidic and sour. As a coffee guru myself I am just gravely disappointed to say the least. I glanced over at the other tables briefly and barely anyone drank their coffee and definitely refills are rarely seen.A must visit for the mostly great food but skip the coffee and opt for a juice or something instead. Hopefully, they will read this and work on improving their coffee!"
4 star rating,This place is unbelievable. The food is incredible. The tastes are unique and so full of flavor. It's one of those times you eat and you feel like this is exactly how I should feel to start the day. Run! don't walk and check this place out.
5 star rating,"Food was delicious.  We walked in about 9am and were seated promptly by the window.  I loved how creative their food was, and the flavor did not disappoint.  Great food, nice restaurant, attentative waitress."
4 star rating,"Great breakfast!  the food, location and atmosphere was very memorable.  I would absolutely eat here again.  The truffle fries were yums, but I love their strawberry jelly."
5 star rating,"A little pricey, but super delicious for a special breakfast or lunch! The smoked salmon Benedict was fantastic and their coffee is very good! Will be back."
4 star rating,Best brunch in Detroit.  Often themed and always good.  The red wedding is my favorite thus far.
5 star rating,"The food was good and the ambiance was interesting. I had an omelet, my only complaint about it was that they do not have feta cheese. I prefer eating eggs with potatoes, but I was disappointed to learn that pork belly is fried in the same fryer as the fries and breakfast potatoes! I'm a vegetarian and this is the first I've heard of a restaurant not cooking the meat separately. I asked if the potatoes could be cooked separately, but I was told it wasn't possible. That left a bad taste in my mouth. The restaurant needs to be more cognizant of vegetarians and other non/pork eaters."
3 star rating,"Wow, what a great place to have brunch in downtown Detroit. Came here for the Ex-presso yourself french toast, and fell in love with the whole menu. I ordered the chief's special roots rock omelette, and it was spectacular. The beef was cooked and marinated just right and the beet puree combined with the mushrooms created a harmonious and delightful taste. The expresso yourself french toast was just as good as it looked. Also their coffee (Zingerman's) was brewed perfectly. The atmosphere and service was great and I would highly recommend it (already have)."
4.5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite places to get breakfast. They serve Zingerman's coffee, which to me is the coffee of the gods. I've only been here twice, but have always gotten the duck bop hash. I'm too chickenshit to try anything else because the duck bop hash is just too amazing and I'm afraid another dish won't compare to how delectable it is. I'd highly recommend this place on a weekday, as the wait times would be shorter. But they've got these things called chairs outside the place that you can sit your impatient bum on, so... No excuses. Try this place out!"
5 star rating,"The food is great. Eggs Benedict are A1, so is the cauliflower cheddar soup. Sit at the bar and talk to Mike the bartender, fun guy."
5 star rating,"We Had breakfast here, great food, hip atmosphere, get one of the Bennies. We had the cheesesteak Benny, it was surprisingly good, order came out in like 15 min despite being super crowded. Would definitely come here again."
5 star rating,"Love the atmosphere, food and service.  Menu is unique and elegant, but not priced that way.  Very affordable.  Bistro-style dining on a dime!  :-)"
5 star rating,"After having spent some time in Brooklyn, this place took me back to that atmosphere.  Hipster, gentrified, great food pretty much sums it up.  They make a sick beermosa with the Grapefruit Sculpin beer and their duck bop hash is not to be missed.  Great mix of sweet with that distinct duck flavor.  Pokemon Go nerd alert: there's a bunch of Pokestops nearby as well as a Drowzee nest."
5 star rating,Great food and service!!! The place was very busy when we came in but we were able to get seated very quickly still.
5 star rating,"The food is amazing!! Philly cheese steak eggs ""benny"" is rocking my world. Dont pass up the truffle fries either!"
5 star rating,"Delicious! Excellent food, friendly service.  Will definitely come back here next time I am in Detroit"
5 star rating,"I really don't yelp often, though, must say, this place is BAD ASS! Great food, amazing service, left very full & very happy! #bacon#omlette#goathash#biscitsandgravy!"
5 star rating,Came here for a brunch before my flight and I ordered the Duck Bop Hash and I did not enjoy it.  The duck in the bbq sauce was way too sweet and did not go well with the hash which i wanted to be good but it was drenched in the bbq sauce I couldn't get the sweetness out of my mouth.  Sweet and savory overkill.
4.5 star rating,"Lured in by the reviews and the online menu, we rolled in here on a Saturday morning after a concert the night before. We were underwhelmed with everything.  Two of us got the spicy belly bennies, a spin on eggs Benedict that looked promising. Poached eggs with a slice of pork belly and some jalapeño pesto on a biscuit sounded clever and tasty. Unfortunately the execution left much to be desired.  The biscuit was nice. But the pork belly was dry and overcooked. The eggs were probably slightly overdone, but that didn't bother me. The breakfast potatoes looked like they may have been frozen - but in any event lacked any flavor and were a bit hard. The place has a fun vibe but wasn't worth our time or the $."
3 star rating,"From the start of sipping my first latte here, I was ready to love The Dime Store. Lovely location and excellent creative menu that captivated both my boyfriend and I. As other reviewers have noted, a wait can be expected on weekends and holidays. We tried the truffle/parm/bacon fries, Mac and cheese, eggs, turkey sausage, pork belly blt sandwich. Everything came out hot, delicious, and wanting more. Waitress who was helping us was pleasant and attentive. So why the three star review? Customer service. We witnessed a couple next to us receive pretty lousy treatment over an issue with the food. I am a frequent diner of all the new exciting places in Detroit, and customer service is SO important. It was uncomfortable watching the situation play out and it seemed like there could have been a more simple way of handling it all. FYI, customer stated that her meat seemed undercooked and the waitress was not only disagreeing with the diner, but took a while to offer the ""can we make you a new plate""? resolution. As a bystander, the entire situation seemed silly. It could have been addressed more efficiently without losing customers. C'mon guys- I want to love you, but this is so basic!"
3 star rating,"Big Mike at the bar was good peeps. Satisfying brunch spot even with the 30 min wait, which flew by with a quick stroll to coffee and Campus Martius."
4 star rating,This place has a great ambiance to food is excellent and the style of the interior is an excellent mix of raw materials and local art!
5 star rating,"Everything was amazing, swapped sides for biscuit and salad, without a problem.  Wish they were in NY"
5 star rating,Love the local roasted coffee and the better than average portion size plus the food tastes great!!
4 star rating,best breakfast I have had in quite some time!! Had the Sausage Hash and it was delicious and was served a very generous potion I will return for another breakfast in the future!!
4 star rating,"My husband and I have been here several times for brunch, drinks and dinners. We love this place so much that we decided to have our rehearsal dinner here before our wedding. Larry and his staff are so incredibly accommodating and we are still getting rave reviews about our rehearsal dinner. The entire restaurant was ours, the food was absolutely amazing and the bartenders were incredible!Every time we are in Detroit, we make sure to stop by the Dime Store!"
5 star rating,"Great breakfast but the place is so dusty it's hanging from the ceiling! Gross. The food was tasty, but not worth the hour wait. I would suggest it but do some cleaning."
4 star rating,Great food and a fun atmosphere! We had one of the omelettes and with only two eggs it was just the right amount of food!  We also got a side of hollandaise and it was delicious!
5 star rating,"One of the best breakfast spots I've ever been to. Duck bop was amazing. My girlfriends Benedict was done to perfection. Their egg poaching technique is awesome - the eggs come out completely intact with a runny yolk. The coffee is strong and fresh, and the service is fast."
4.5 star rating,"Came for a visit when we were in town overnight. My Bloody Mary was good, nothing too crazy. The Beermosas they serve are also good, never having had one before (they used a local brewed beer, you many have heard of it - Atwater - and it was also a decent price), and I would have to say both of our dishes were very tasty but I expected a bit more I guess after reading their menu. We both picked a dish that was on their chef features. The service was awesome and the atmosphere is very cool. I'm not giving it 5 stars because it was a bit steep in price (I mean 13-14.00 per meal is quite high as it was only some bread and eggs with corned beef hash, and I thought the food was good but nothing I will order again. We may have to go back and try an omelet or the eggs benny"
4 star rating,"Great service, big fatty portions, and a great atmosphere. Highly recommend the duck confit hash and tech French toast. Yummmmmmm."
5 star rating,"The benny was good. Busy and cramped inside. Worth a try as the food is good, but service is slow and you will spend a full hour."
3 star rating,Coffee was great. Brunch was amazing!! Homemade soup and lemon curd French toast. Seriously worth the wait...which was almost too long.
4 star rating,"This place sits in a great location right in the central business district of Downtown Detroit and bleeds coolness and to add to all of that, the food is great! I enjoyed lunch here with a co-worker three days in a row. Be sure to try a cup of the cauliflower soup and the bacon parmesean truffle fries. I promise you won't be disappointed."
4 star rating,"Living in NYC for 15 years, I have eaten some outstanding meals, but THIS was hands down the best brunch I've ever had. Nothing more to say other than EAT HERE NOW!"
5 star rating,"Overall, I was very impressed with the food here. You're going to have to wait if you come here on a weekend, but it is worth it. I got the turkey sausage breakfast sandwich, which was really good. The sausage you could tell was homemade. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is that they served it with a hamburger bun? I feel like there are so many other better ways to serve it (biscuit, pretzel bun, etc) that would accentuate the the sandwich. I would get again but see if I could get with a different bun."
4 star rating,Some of the best steak Benedict I've ever tried which means a lot since I'm from Chicago with all the good food.The bloodys and mimosas are to die for but the service needs major improvement.
4 star rating,"Popped in here for brunch during Movement Festival on a recommendation from a music business colleague.  After a short wait in the lobby, we were sat at the bar (we love to sit at the bar).  Food and service (although hipster) was outstanding and on point.  Highly recommended!"
5 star rating,"a really nice place to have a weekend brunch or breakfast. if you go, try the massive serving of pork rinds with a sweet and salty, sticky topping of white truffle oil. they have a great selection of dishes to pick from. i tried a southwestern benedict on biscuits that was spicy and delicious., they do serve alcohol, so that's nice for a brunch. get there early and expect to wait.love, juston"
4.5 star rating,"Located in the heart of Detroit, the ambiance is good, but usually there's a long wait time on weekends. We ended up waiting for an hour to get a table for 6. The beermosa drink was decent, but not a huge fan. The korean fries were as good as any regular fries but topped with meat and some kimhci type sauce.The chicken pesto sandwich was my favorite thing here."
3 star rating,The food here is quite delicious. I got the hash with Duck bop and a Bloody Mary. It was a very good meal. The service was good too.
5 star rating,"Hubby and I went there for early Sunday brunch.  I got the cheesesteak benedict (which was awesome) and he got the waffle.  The food is great, prices a bit on the higher end, but the service was horrible.  There were literally 4 tables in the place and we couldn't get our waiter to come back for coffee.  I had to get up and ask.  Then we couldn't get our bill.  That's why only 3 stars.  They were all behind the bar talking about how hungover they were from the night before.  Really unprofessional.  For that kind of $$ and great place I would have expected more from the staff."
3 star rating,"Went there after reading the rave reviews.  The Dime Store is not the best brunch in Detroit!  Toast wanna be.  Waffle was cold, omelet not desirable, potatoes average.  Mac and cheese was pitiful.  Crowded seating, small tables. Wish I went to Toast.  However, I will say the staff was friendly. The food will not bring me back."
1 star rating,Downtown Detroit needs more breakfast spots as you'll quickly notice as you walk past the few restaurants open on weekend mornings that are all crowded.Yay.What's not to like? Fun and friendly waitstaff. Well-made breakfast and brunch fare. Tasty Bloody Marys.Duck confit was tasty. Egg sandwiches with lox were tasty.
4 star rating,Amazing brunch. Their meals are always made fresh and potatoes are really good there. It can get pretty crowded and service takes a hit becuz of how busy they are. I would definable your recommend if your downtown Detroit and want some where good to eat and don't mind a crowd place. No matter what you order you will love it here.
5 star rating,This hidden gem is amazing for breakfast. The steak eggs Benedict was incredible. Top marks for the French toast also. Check it out!
5 star rating,"Great food, cool decor. We were in town visiting for a family reunion and found this place on Yelp. My parents loved it (and they are hard to please). My Dad had the burger- good, solid beef burger. My mom had the chicken salad and loved it. My husband had the duck and thought it was fantastic. I had the cod sandwich as a salad and it was great. It is a great option to have all sandwiches available as a salad. The service was also good, although our waitress was new, she tried her best. Bar selection was great too. We would definitely stop through again."
4 star rating,"LOOOOVE this menu... I've only been once and I had the Hangover Burger... It was AMAZING. 8 oz burger topped with pulled pork, a fried egg, and crispy leeks! I ordered it bunless and U still could only eat half. It was good but It needed more seasoning... For all that was going on the last thing I expected it to lack was flavor lol! Service is a bit slow and the wait is long...."
3 star rating,"Hour and a half wait??? Headed over to Grand Trunk and had amazing food, great Bloody Mary's, and excellent service in a Detroit landmark."
4.5 star rating,CRAZY busy during lunch time!! Go before noon or wait until after 12:45pm or 1pm. The cooks are great! Really friendly staff. Food is amazing as well. Korean Fries... duck sandwich.... nitro brew.... chili.... all good to try.
5 star rating,"Went there on a Wednesday around 2pm, the place was full. The place is not very big, i don't recommend if you are in a hurry or with a group more than 4. The two of us sat at the bar, it took about 45 mins to get our food. I ordered the sausage omelette, my brother got a hamburger and side salad. Average food with good service. The bartender that served us was very friendly and attending to refill our drinks and bring side condiments."
3 star rating,"Excellent menu! Creative breakfast and lunch entree's that I've never seen anywhere else. Everything that I've tried has been great. Need to arrive early if going for lunch, because seating is limited and it gets age at lunch crowd."
5 star rating,"I went here twice this weekend for breakfast and the food was great both times (especially the house-made sausage in the omelet)! I actually almost did not go back because the bartender the first time during brunch was terrible. He was a bigger guy with a beard...way too cool for school and really rude. He seems like he should work at a hipster dive bar where he can think he's way cooler than he actually is. High-five, bro.Thankfully, I decided to give it a second try on Tuesday, 5/5. I met a good friend of the owners (who was managing) and he was super nice. He saw that I was there a few minutes before they opened and let me hang out while the kitchen opened up. He was talkative and apologetic for the super cool bartender. Overall, I would absolutely recommend Dime Store to anyone looking for excellent food in the area; the ambiance is awesome, the prices are excellent, etc."
4 star rating,We had an excellent breakfast here. Our server recommended the specials and we were blown away by how good they were. I am definitely going back!
5 star rating,"Saturday morning brunch visit-worth the wait.  I had the truffle fries, which really made the meal special for me. Excellent service and what a gem to have in downtown Detroit."
5 star rating,"My wife and I are from Seattle, WA and I was in town for a workshop.  We wanted to get into downtown to eat dinner.  We saw this place got good reviews and we were not disappointed. We walked into a comfortable, clean restaurant.  Our server was friendly and we talked about local beer and wines; we settled on splitting a half order of Bacon, Parm & Truffle Fries, the Grilled Chicken Breast Salad, and a Duck Confit Reuben. I would guess that the entire menu is good. We were very pleased with our dishes, but that reuben was to die for, duck is rich but they put exactly the right amount on the sandwich.  We walked here from the People Mover and access was easy."
5 star rating,Detroit is alive and well!  Great food and friendly service in a packed space.  I will definitely return.  Everyone seems happy in here.  Malted waffle with fresh fruit was delicious.
5 star rating,"I don't think I ordered anything I didn't like from this place because everything I've tried so far has been beyond delicious. My friend and I love going here for lunch during the workweek. It's always bustling with people so you might have to wait a few minutes or so to get seated. Most recently, we ordered the brussels sprouts salad, the sweet poached pear salad, and a side of their house fries and they were, once again, so delicious. I'm a big fan of this place so definitely give this place a try!"
5 star rating,"We loved it!  The wait was long for Sunday brunch, but so totally worth it.  I recommend the benedicts or the omelette--but really the biggest problem was deciding what to have.  The service was GREAT despite the fact that the place was busy and tables were turning over quickly.  I love the casual atmosphere and friendly vibe--and, of course, the waffles."
4.5 star rating,Yes.  Best brunch in the city.  Beer-mosas and smoked salmon eggs benedict will re-arrange your views on life.
5 star rating,Pretty good food. Nice atmosphere but very loud. They could stand to install some acoustic tiles on the ceiling
4 star rating,I LOVE Dime Store! I keep looking for excuses/reasons to head downtown just to go back. I had the warm brussel sprouts salad with grilled chicken. It was absolutely amazing. It also has a great atmosphere. Such a cool addition to the Detroit food scene.
5 star rating,Great brunch/breakfast. It's insanely crowded on weekends so be prepared to wait. Friendly staff and  unique/tasty food. One of the best brunch spots in the metro area for sure.
4 star rating,"Food was definitely worth the wait, and there was quite a wait!  Everything was beautifully plated and delicious to eat.  Great location and service was friendly, efficient and hospitable.  Can't wait to go back."
5 star rating,"How can I say this? I love love love this place. The breakfast is amazing, the brunch menu is outstanding. The chef knows exactly what they're doing, the servers know exactly what they're doing, everyone knows what they're doing here! It's a really fun environment, I've never experienced a place like this. Cool concept. Keep up the good work."
5 star rating,"Yum, we love this brunch spot! We'd probably come more often if it wasn't downtown. The food is delicious, the Bloody Mary's tasted a little watered down."
4 star rating,"Great brunch spot in Detroit! The place was busy until close, so either get there early or expect a wait! We had the sausage hash and a breakfast sandwich with bacon of course. Service was great and food was outstanding!! Definitely recommend."
5 star rating,"Always fresh, always amazing service. Highly recommend the Dime Store for Sunday brunch or lunch with friends. The ambiance is sunny and open. The environment, food and service leave me feeling satisfied every time."
5 star rating,The dime store was terrific fast service polite food excellent my mother was very pleased with my choice only problem for most restaurant downtown Detroit the parking is horrible almost laughable smh... Would return for future food and service..
4.5 star rating,Food and service was awesome! I got the veggie hash and a mimosa and was not disappointed. Will be back!
5 star rating,Really good food and comfortable atmosphere. Just went with a recommendation and I was not disappointed! Friendly staff and quick service for a relaxing breakfast at 830 on a Thursday. Tried the sausage hash and it was great with a cup of tea!
5 star rating,"Dime Store is absolutely awesome, great staff, good happy hour prices and delicious food. Only thing sucks it's always busy during the lunch hours so we do carryouts and eat it at the office."
5 star rating,"VERY good!! I got the sausage hash and it was very delicious. This is a small place, so the wait can be a little long but it is worth it! The wait staff was super friendly and helpful. Very cool atmosphere and delicious food! Highly recommend!"
5 star rating,"Dime Store is a top quality restaurant that serves food in the traditional serving size manner.  You won't have to worry about sharing a small platter of three avocado crab cakes amongst four people at Dime Store.  At Dime Store, each person orders their own meal, a lost concept in the up and coming restaurant scene in Detroit.  The pork burger is by far the best pork burger I have had anywhere.  The truffle fries serve as a nice companion to any dish there.  I have tried most things on the menu and have never left disappointed.  The waiting staff is very nice and attentive.  The bartender, Big Mike, is also super friendly and has a decent beer list for a decent price.  I love Dime Store!"
5 star rating,"Really great experience. Even better food. Was here on a spontaneous weekend trip with my mom and we stayed in the Westin Book Cadillac. We needed somewhere to go for breakfast before 12. I found the Dime Store on Yelp and thought the pictures looked good so we walked there and had about a 30 minute wait but it was sooo worth it. She ordered the Veggie Hash and oooed and ahhhed over it. I got the brioche French toast with fruit and it was actually the best french toast I've had. They served it with real maple syrup too, none of that Mrs. Butterworts nonsense. The service was great. It was quick and efficient because they were so busy, but they were still friendly. The food was amazinggggg. I totally recommend if you're in the area. It was really good. The place has a really cool vibe too. When I was there they had a parks and rec quote on the walk which I thought was funny. Also, they have you wait for your table in this lobby with really comfortable couches and they give you menus out there so once your seated you can just go ahead and order."
5 star rating,"I love this place! The food is always fantastic, the ingredients fresh and the environment is lively! The owners take a real interest in the restaurant and it shows !!"

5 star rating,"We stopped here before heading to Toronto and had a yummy Beer-mosa to fuel our trip! The food was yummy, a little pricey but worth it."
4 star rating,"Love love this place!  Delicious Eggs Benedict, and pretty moderately priced.  Definitely worth the wait for brunch on a Sunday morning!"
5 star rating,"Great brunch spot we discovered while driving through Detroit on our way to Toronto. It's in the downtown area but had no problem finding street parking on a Sunday. We got there around 12:30 pm. Put our name down and waited in the lounge area comfortably for 45 mins before being seated. Impeccable service from the hostess to bar tender to server. We ordered kimchi fries, el toro Rojas Benny and duck hash. Serving size is good and food is top notch. I wish we could try more food. We'll be back soon for sure."
4.5 star rating,This place is simply awesome!!!  From the busy atmosphere to the tight packed tables and of course the food does not disappoint. We had to wait 40 minutes to get in but that just means it's really good. We grabbed a coffee from them while we waited and when we sat down the tables to our right and left were all sharing our meals with each other. I think we had a taste from half the menu and I can honestly say everything was bang on. Can't wait to go back!
5 star rating,Had breakfast there this morning. Great menu and friendly staff. Small but cozy - like the vibe. Highly recommend.
5 star rating,"The Duck Bop Hash is amazing... Korean-American fusion at it's best. The flavors explode in your mouth with a perfect blend of sweet, spicy, and salty. Duck for brunch. Who would have thought. Well done!"
5 star rating,"The Dime Store - Oh where do I begin!? I was in the area with my dad after taking my dogs to Canine to 5 to get their monthly grooming session in. It was mid-morning around 9AM and we had a taste for some good ol breakfast - I didn't know of too many breakfast joints in the area so of course I searched Yelp.  Sure enough - the Dime Store popped up with the highest ratings so on our way we were.  Before you know it im sitting in the Dime Store being waited on by a young Latino man.  He was very welcoming and abundant in knowledge with respect to what was listed on the menu.  As first timers we asked what their famous dishes were and what he recommended we try.  He responded ""Everything!"" Haha He recommended El Toro Rojo and some other dish with sausage, mashed potatoes w/cranberries and spinach (I forgot the name) - My goodness It was Amazing! I wanted to order another dish but then I realized I forgot to pay for parking - so it was time to go!  Prices were decent but that whole visit put a dent in my pocket lol We will meet again Dime Store - hopefully next time I won't be paying anything less than a Dime!"
5 star rating,Great place in downtown Detroit. For brunch there was a 35 min wait time but the waiting area was really nice and comfy. Cheessteak was good .most important service was AAA.
5 star rating,"Overall, had great service and this was quite a lively brunch spot.  The duck hash was my fav, but the mimosas seemed a bit OJ-heavy and I did not feel great afterwards!  My fault, as we ordered a pitcher (we couldn't finish it anyways), but it did not feel like there was much champagne at all.  The Benedict was pretty good as well, but nothing crazy special.  I would recommend checking it out, but just a normal brunch to me."
3 star rating,"Hands down best food we had on our Labor Day weekend trip to Detroit.  Great vibe, friendly and laid back staff.  Had the PB and J French toast and BLTE breakfast sammie...will definitely be back!  Food made right in front of you in kitchen, all quality and much pride taken in preparing!"
5 star rating,"This place came with rave reviews and in my experience, lives up to the hype. Wide variety of breakfast and lunch foods that hit the spot. I like that they let you create your own omelette with options such as gouda, bacon, and avocado. Delicious bloody mary. The wait can be long but the food makes it worth it. Definitely recommend."
5 star rating,"Delicious brunch!! Had the best omelettes, sausages, cheese and fresh n veggies.  The service was awesome!"
5 star rating,"I enjoy this place for lunch carryout.  I was a bit put off before because I didnt think they had any veggie options, but they really do and you can just veganize by holding the cream or cheese.  I've never dined in but hope to try it out for brunch in the future.  Their veggie burger is homemade and awesome! Main thing is the way they treat me, every time I walk in the door I am immediately greeted with a smile and hello.  It's the little things in life that make me happy!"
4.5 star rating,"Came here for breakfast during the sae world congress. I had the salmon Benedict and it was amazing! eggs done perfectly, fresh salmon and a side salad with a light dressing. I'd post a photo but I ate it too fast haha"
5 star rating,"Wonderful.  We've been there twice now and understand why people are willing to wait so long to eat here. Luckily we got there five minutes after they opened at 8:00 on a Saturday and the place was already half full.  Plan ahead. We had the spicy pork belly eggs benedict (very good) and a sausage breakfast sandwich (excellent) -both with potatoes(great flavor) instead of the salad.  Both entrees were really good but the ""spicy"" really wasn't and the amount of pork belly on each piece was very small.  That is the reason we are only giving them four stars instead of five.  They serve Zingerman's coffee which was bold but smooth.  The service could not have been any better.  Our server was very friendly and he always knew exactly when to check on is.  Looking forward to the next visit."
4 star rating,Great little breakfast/lunch spot for downtown.  We went there today (12/29) for the first time and were very impressed.  We had the Korean BBQ sandwich and the PBLT sandwiches-both with fries.  They were excellent.  I liked the flavor of the Korean sandwich better but the bread on the other.  You can't go wrong with either.  The fries were very good and the portion huge.  We can't wait to go back and try some of the other items.  P.S.  They have a good selection of Michigan craft beers as well including two on tap.
4 star rating,"Back for the third time. Every time it gets better. Had the special ""dirty hash"". Phenomenal. Every time I come it keeps getting better. This place is a must."
5 star rating,Menu is unbelievable. So many good things. Home made soups. Cheese steak is excellent. Great wine and atmosphere. I will be back.
5 star rating,"As much as I've wanted to give Dime Store a try over the years the long wait times have deterred me. I get hangry too easily but was determined and well prepared when we finally got around to trying it. Armed with a light snack, just in case, the Wife and I got to the restaurant right around noon Saturday morning. As predicted we were given an hour to 2 hour wait with the option to sit at the bar and shorten our wait. Larger parties had an even longer wait or worse, were turned away. Unlike other high volume spots, they don't have a pager or text system. You get an estimated wait, a number, and wait around the lobby to hear your name/number called. If you're not there when they call your number you're out of luck. As much as this system worked against others it actually worked in our favor. Quite a few people left or weren't around when their number was called so we ended up only waiting 45 minutes. It's a neat little, little being the operative word, place. They cram you in with your neighbors and due to the small space full of patrons the noise level is fairly loud. Being it was only the two of us and we weren't exactly expecting a romantic quiet brunch this didn't bother us much. The couple behind us with two young children did have a hard time though. Now the food. Amazing. It was worth the wait, noise level, and claustrophobic feeling of our table. Everything on the menu looked so good I couldn't decide if I wanted lunch or breakfast. Since it was brunch after all I went with the bacon avocado omelet and a side of Korean fries. I'm a fan of all things avocado and especially enjoyed this fresh omelet with the perfectly cooked bacon. The fries were equally delicious and full of flavor. I ended up eating myself into a food coma so much so that I almost didn't finish my perfectly proportional beermosa. My Wife ended up ordering a smorgasbord of sorts, fruit, salad, and half mac and cheese. She enjoyed all of it even though none of it really went together. Her only complaint was that her mimosa had a bit too much juice for her liking. All in all, we will endure the long wait again for this place."
5 star rating,"I found this place in an attempt to find some sort of nutritional salvation after eating fried food for three days at a conference. Everything on the menu sounded great, good variety (just enough without being too overwhelming) and interesting favor combination - if you're looking for a plain old salad you won't find it here. I have legitimately been dreaming about their pouched pear salad since the moment I finished it and just about licked the bowl clean. The flavors were crisp and the ingredients were so fresh, I'm not usually a big salad person but I couldn't put down my fork. My only disappointment was finding this place too late in my trip whenever I'm back in Detroit I'll be back again...and again!"
5 star rating,Be sure to bring your appetite when you come to Dime Store. They serve generous portions. I had the bacon avocado omelette and the spicy Korean fries! The only downside is their is a terribly long wait for Sunday brunch upwards of an hour and a half. Not an ideal location if you're trying to eat with a big group. Regardless the food was delicious hence I still gave it 5 stars!
5 star rating,"Popped in for lunch on my own when taking a break from a conference and ate at the counter. Wow, would eat here all the time if downtown more. Spicy korean fries and some awesome salad with much more going on that just baby lettuce out of a box. Love the local sourcing too."
5 star rating,"It's kind of a small venue, but still comfortable once we got to our seats. My initial impression was ""meh"" since our wait for the server to address us was initially pretty long (had to ask the hostess to send one over), but once our order was taken, everything was great! Waffles and omelettes were what we ordered and they were delish!"
4 star rating,Excellent place for breakfast/lunch! Really cool atmosphere inside and amazing local food. Quality local ingredients and excellent specials. Can't wait to go back!
5 star rating,"A place where the wait for your table might be as enjoyable as your actual meal. We loved the open, comfortable lobby and the Zingerman's coffee until our table was ready. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. So many great choices but went with the Ruby Stacks French toast on the specials menu and it did not disappoint. The brioche for French toast is delicious. Great brunch choice and possibly the best part is not having to stand uncomfortably for an hour getting cranky until you get your coffee."
4.5 star rating,The food was Ok! I had an omelette it came with hash browns and toast! One slice of toast...two halves. I'm used to two pieces of toast being served. I had to send my Omelette back because the Cheese wasn't melted (a huge pet peeve of mine). The staff member who took my omelette (not my waitress) forgot and it took forever to get my meal back. My plate came back with less potatoes and he said they would bring me more. Never got those. We were finishing up around closing time and I felt as if we were being rushed because they were ready to go. The wait was 40 minutes & I wasn't really pleased with the experience. I can take or leave this place. Wouldn't go bac
3 star rating,"An otherwise delightful breakfast was marred when I commented that my latte seemed to have very little espresso.  The waitress offered to add a shot at my request, but did not inform me that $2.75 would be added to the bill.  I expected that it would be gratis or no more than the $.75 charged for an extra shot most places.  The waitress checked with management that was unwilling to budge.  Unfortunately, I was left with a bad taste from feeling ripped off."
2 star rating,"One of my favorite brunch places on the city. Their duck bop and spicy Korean fries are my favorite items on the menu and their weekly specials are never a let down. If you're going on a weekend, make sure to get their early as it's about a 30-60 minute wait."
5 star rating,"This is a good place for brunch. Their food is creative and different. Their waffles are so good, crispy and moist. They're open later than a lot of other restaurants in the area that serve brunch, so that's always a good thing. Their omelette are good and they always have something yummy on their special of the day."
4 star rating,This was a really great place for breakfast. Its a small and popular place so be ready to wait for an hour. Since it is downtown we just put our name in and then walked around for a bit. The service was great and the food was delicious.
5 star rating,"Met here for Sunday brunch and found the atmosphere enticing and was prepared to really like this place.  Unfortunately, the anticipation was much greater than the payoff.  I had bacon and avacado omelet and a bloody mary.  The bloody was dull and  boring with a pickle in it that looked old enough to vote.  The ""bacon"" in the omelet (think ham) must have been bacon from our Canadian neighbors.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, just should have been described as such as we were in the US.  The service was also lackluster.While I would not call it  place to avoid if friends insist, it is not a destination I would imitate."
3 star rating,"I'm not really one to complain but the service today was terrible. From food on the back of the plates to sticky stuff on the sugar packets to having our bill put on the table before asking if we wanted anything else. Plus not bringing water, nothing to stir latte with to asking immediately if the payment was ready. Not once did they even check in with us.  He even took the bill back before I signed it. The food was also mediocre."
2 star rating,"First time here with a friend today. I had a brunch special, and my friend ordered the kimchi fries and duck reuben. The food was fresh, delicious, and portioned well. Service was quick and friendly. The general ambiance is unique and the menu is diverse. It is hard to find parking and navigate downtown (especially with the Q Rail construction), but if you happen to be in the area, I recommend giving this place a shot!"
5 star rating,This will become a regular place for me.  The duck is incredible!
5 star rating,"For what this restaurant is, I think it's overrated. I've been a few times on separate occasions ordering different menu items and I've just never been wow-ed. I had the veggie omelette with home fries- it was good, but not great. The second time I had the veggie burger which was dry. The mustard spread that went on top was bitter and I ended up scraping it off. Everything on their menu is just decent and I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here."
4.5 star rating,Not worth the hype. Wait time was long....expected. Ordered orange juice. It never came. Food took forever. Asked for extra mustard sauce for the dry burger. Never came. A guy behind the bar saw us looking around and after a while gave us the mustard sauce. Waitress was RUDE when asked to remove orange juice from the bill. Food wasn't as great as the hype.
1 star rating,"I am a bit of a food snob.  I will admit that.  I've eaten at thousands of restaurants in the country.   This place,  for a downtown location and a 35 minute wait,  was decent, but not great.  The hostess acted a bit snooty with us cause we were told it would be 45 minutes to an hour and we came back in 30 minutes from a walk around downtown and she was rude about having called our name and not being there the first time.   We ordered the cinnamon apple waffle special and it was just okay.   It came out very soggy and not enough whipped cream, and not crisp at all.   I got the BLTE and the bacon was good but that was about it.   Not enough spicy mayo,  it was wet from the tomato which made it very soggy.   The coffee was the best thing they had.   Other people's skillets and stuff looked good,  but I was disappointed.   For a 4.5 star rating I expected more."
3 star rating,They're the best food is great plus it's downtown Detroit  and a great view of the city in side the store is a industrial look and feel to it as y come in the lobby it takes yr breath away it's a beautiful site to see it's a must see
5 star rating,"One of my favorite Detroit restaurants for brunch! The Duck Bop is a must for a first visit, its a surprising collection of flavors for a breakfast meal. The Brussel Sprout salad is great for a savory meal. Some dishes aren't quite as robist on flavors, but certainly solid and delicious. The specials are also fun and low risk to try."
5 star rating,Food was excellent very busy restaurant wait wasn't long at all service was great waiter was always visible and attentive bloody Mary was excellent loved this place will be going back very soon!
5 star rating,"Easily the best breakfast I've had in Detroit.  After risking life, limb, and automobile alignment travelling to Rose's only to be turned away by the incredibly courteous ""maître de"" who told me and my partner to ""seriously, get out of the doorway and wait in your car for us to text you,"" we headed back downtown to try DS and have yet to find anything comparable in the metro area.  Any variation of eggs benny that they're offering will do the trick, and all of their sandwiches are unbeatable for the price.  No need to drive to Birmingham for a brunch option any longer."
5 star rating,Going for brunch? The earlier the better. What to order? The salmon Benedict.
5 star rating,Had the Duck Rueben today for lunch was one of the best sandwiches I ever had.  Great bread fresh flavors from the cabbage and arugula with a wonderful sauce.  The duck confit had great flavor and just the right amount of ingredients on the sandwich.  Wonderful service in a hip atmosphere downtown in the Chrysler house.
5 star rating,Best brunch in the city!  Food was delicious & so were the spicy bloody mary's.  Music & vibe is very cool.  Long wait but well worth it!
5 star rating,What a wonderful place to eat in downtown Detroit. Justin gives the best service I've had In awhile
4.5 star rating,Very busy but not sure why. Salad came with lemon dressing that was honestly all lemon juice. Eggs Benny were great though.
3 star rating,Spent the night at the Book Cadillac after a Beck concert and walked to Dime Store for breakfast.  Awesome food and great waitstaff!
5 star rating,"My friends and I went to The Dime Store today and were told we would have to wait about 25-30 mins for a table. We expected this and made ourselves comfortable on the couches outside. There are menus outside so we even used the time to decide what we wanted to order. After about 35 minutes we were called inside. We were seated and the bartender who also doubled as our waiter came to take our order. Not sure what it was about us but he was a little rude as he took our drink order. We didn't pay too much attention to that and were eager to place our food order as it was already 2 pm and we yet to have brunch.We then watched as others who came in after us got their order as we continued waiting. About 35 minutes later when we hadn't even got the banana bread we ordered, we asked a waitress to check on our order. She then reminded the bar tender/waiter who then came out to us and told us that our order was delayed because our order was put in last. Why our order was last, we have no idea. So finally about 45 minutes after we were seated, we received our order. My friends ordered an El Toro Rojo, a meat loaf sandwich and I ordered the vegetarian omelette. Our food was good except the portions were small for the price. We liked the ambience as well. The service was a big let down and the funny thing is, the bar tender/waiter was nice to us at the time of paying our check. We will tipped 15% but were definitely annoyed with the service.Overall, we were disappointed with this visit but would recommend this place. Maybe with better service, we can actually enjoy the food next time. P.S: The lady checking people in (Nicole) was doing a great job."
3 star rating,My absolute favorite restaurant in Downtown Detroit! Everything I've tried here is delicious & a decent beer selection for the size of the place. Crazy busy during lunch hours.
5 star rating,"Very very good flavor and price. Butttttttttt, you have to wait for a loooong time!!!!"
4 star rating,"What an amazing find this place was. After spending the night at the Motor City Casino we asked a friend and fellow foodie for a good breakfast/lunch location.  She suggested the Dime Store.  I quickly grabbed my phone and looked to see what fellow Yelper's had to say and they too agreed with their high marks and positive reviews. It is the first level of a high rise office building in the Financial District downtown.  We ordered the Mac and Cheese with Brussel Sprouts and pork, wow what a great combination.  The Mac and Cheese comes plain then there are a number of extras you can add, and I love Brussel Sprouts.  Then I tried the Duck Bop Hash based on the waitresses recommendation and let me say she was right, it was amazing.  So many favors with a sweet and spicy combination, it was a party in my mouth for the taste buds.  I highly recommend it and will be back as there are about 30 more items I want to try.  The atmosphere was all Detroit and the wait staff was Fantastic!  If you find yourself in the D or are looking for a good reason to visit, this is it!!!!  Thanks fellow Yelper's - spot on as always."

5 star rating,I love this place. The services is good and the staff is friendly. The turkey sausage sandwich is really good.
5 star rating,"I wrote a review of this place yesterday as I believed they over charge for their orange juice. I'm sure some people read it and thought I was an idiot that didn't know anything about the industry or simple economics. Well I can tell you that might be true, I have said many dumb things in my life and have never worked in the industry. Well following my 1 star posting, which really was only to see if someone might respond to me, I got a chance to talk to the owner. It was a good exchange and not one of those angry ""you don't know what you're talking about"" Buzzfeed ""articles"" you may see. It impressed me and now I feel I can give this place a much more deserving 5 stars than the 1 I gave it less then 24 hours ago. I can't wait to go back with my family and friends who love this place, along with what seemed to be most of the city of Detroit."
5 star rating,Good food. I went at 2.30pm and it was empty. Had the Korean BBQ sandwich. Yummy but wish there was more pickles veggies. The fries were delish.  Also had the goat cheese and pear salad and it was very yummy! I would totally go back.
4 star rating,Great atmosphere and even better food! It wasn't that bad of a wait either. This will be the go to brunch spot for sure!
4.5 star rating,"This place is the bees knees. The food is amazing and aren't overly giant or tiny portions. My only complaint was that service was extremely slow. We got there at 11:30 and they refused to seat us until the one person we were waiting on got there. They finally seated us around 11:50, and immediately took our orders. We then waited exactly an hour for our food to come out. The food was worth that wait but I wouldn't want to wait that long again. I'd tell everyone to try it at least once, and then decide for yourself if you like it or not."
4 star rating,"I had the sausage hash, which was a delicious blend of fresh flavors. Many of the menu items piqued my interest, and I can't wait to go back and try more.Service was quick, helpful and polite. Definitely a go-to spot for brunch and more in downtown Detroit."
4 star rating,Great breakfast. Really enjoyed the brunch. Our waiter was wonderful. Will surely be back when I visit Detroit again. Kudos!
4 star rating,This is a unique place with some good chow!!  My girls & their friends (tweens) commented how awesome the food was & want to go back - a LOT. My only issue was seating was sort of limited but I'm sure cost of 'space' is high... so makes sense. I thought the desk chairs were very cool.
4 star rating,"First-time Detroit visitors. Decided to try Dime Shop for lunch based on its high reviews on Yelp. The good reviews were right--food and service were outstanding. We ordered the cauliflower gruyere soup, shrimp and grits, and bacon cheese fries (fatties); I would recommend each of the three. Our waiter/bartender was also awesome--he talked to us about the city, which we otherwise were fairly unfamiliar with, and gave us a list of recommended bars. Highly recommend Dime Shop!"
5 star rating,"The reviews for this place are great and I'm not really sure how. I ordered the Cinnamon Toast Crunch waffle, which was just mediocre. I also got a side of mac n cheese, which was absolutely disgusting. My husband ordered the chicken pesto sandwich with fries. He took 2 bites of it and said it was terrible. His fries were also undercooked. Will never come back."
2 star rating,Last meal in Detroit before launching back to PHL.  Did the Cheese steak Benny and enjoyed every bite. Side salad was perfectly dressed and had me wanting me more.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Coffee wasn't my favorite so it held the rating to 4 stars.
4 star rating,"Bland food. The veggie burger is a flavorless barley ball, ice cream scooped onto a bun. But on a Sunday, stuck on downtown Detroit, you may not have a choice. This town is forsaken."
1 star rating,"I love this place. I'm a big fan of the atmosphere and service. When we arrived to put our name in, we were immediately greeted by a nice woman brewing coffee. We were able to grab a coffee while we waited. I love how you can comfortably relax in the lobby while you wait for your table. Once we were seated, our waitress came over immediately to take our drink order and to explain the menu. I ordered the turkey sausage and stuffing Benedict. It was so unique and amazing! I did not feel rushed or crowded, although the place was hopping! I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for brunch in Detroit!"
5 star rating,"Great comfort food with a twist!!! Had Brussel Sprouts, soup, mac& Cheese salad and sandwich"
4.5 star rating,Great food!  Fast service. Only con is that your clothes will reek like a diner afterwards.
5 star rating,"The dime store is so delicious!!! I've been here twice now and I'm addicted! Both times we had a big brunch group. They not only fit us in with a reasonable wait time, they provided EXCELLENT service! Fast, great food, attentive oh and did I mention delicious?! Go here asap!"
5 star rating,Love the place.  Hate finding parking.
5 star rating,"This is a great place to visit but I would not recommend visiting if you have any pressing matters to attend to. Visiting during the work week at lunch time is not recommended as this place is on the smaller side and fills up very quickly with people who are on lunch break .The food has a very rustic nuance that I have only seen at a few other places, all of the ingredients have a very fresh taste. EACH item has has a very detailed and well-thought-out recipe that one can appreciate all the way down to the blackberry jam served on multigrain toast. You would think that you were at a casual fine dining restaurant based on the quality but you get to enjoy the quirky and hip atmosphere without the pretentious additives. Love this place and would recommend it to anyone"
4 star rating,Excellent food and service. Had the hangover burger and fries. Very good quick and friendly service. It was super busy but we got right it. If your nearby you  have to go. A varied menu of great food.
5 star rating,The best brunch food ever especially if you're hungover lol. The food there is addictive. The wait is long so I would recommend going before you're hungry.
5 star rating,"Good experience,  great food & service, fun staff. I would go often if I lived in Detroit."
4 star rating,Came with my family from out of town. The atmosphere is hip and fun. The noise level is high but not obnoxious and the spirits are very lively from the attached kitchen and busy dining area. Our server did not skip a beat and made sure we had a wonderful time. I especially recommend the steak and cheese Benny and cold brew coffee. One of the best breakfasts I've had.
5 star rating,"Brunch was just ok. Bloody Mary was very bland and had  just a pickle in it but NO olives, horseradish, lemons, limes.  My avocado bacon omelette was a little salty with very boring, unflavored tiny (frozen) potatoes.  Not impressed!"
2 star rating,"This place is great!! The Brussel Sprout salad was so tasty, fresh, and very filling. I also enjoyed the atmosphere and staff is friendly and helpful. I definitely recommend this to anyone new to the area for a quick bite to eat."
4.5 star rating,"This was my first experience with the Dime restaurant. I ordered a cup of butter nut squash with an egg white omelet with turkey sausage. The food was very fresh and presentation was also good. My only bad experience with this restaurant is the service. The cooks are very slow and not organized. We waited over 30 minutes for our meal and it was upsetting, but the manager did a good job on handling the situation and compensated for my wait. Overall, great location and great tasting food. I'm happy Detroit is coming back..."
3 star rating,Fabulous breakfast place. The wait can be a pain but it is well worth it. Homemade food from scratch and great coffee. Worth all the time and definitely one of the best of Detroit.
5 star rating,The food is awesome! Service was quick and the server was friendly and attentive. It gets quite busy so going at 11:30 is like the perfect time to get seated. Definitely recommend!
5 star rating,Love' me some Detroit City local foods. The Dime Store is going to be my daily devotion while in town. Great service by Antonio and food was excellent!
5 star rating,"Unique menu and everything I've had has been awesome. My only complaint is that this place is super busy at lunch time, so if you want to try it come early. A good sign though that this place is always busy!"
5 star rating,"What a great find! Of course it seems a few people (1K) have known about how great this place is for a while! Hotel room coffee never does it for me, so first things first, I needed to get my hands on some hot fresh brew. I've heard so much about Zingerman's growing up in Michigan and I finally got to try it, and it definitely jump started my energy for the day, not to mention it was delicious! The hubs and I got a plate, wait no... a huge platter of fried pork rinds covered with white truffle oil, bulgogi and sriracha - they came fresh from the fryer bubbly and still popping! I usually don't like pork rinds, but these were so tasty, I couldn't stop eating them! I was literally craving everything on their menu, so I had to stop myself at just getting the housemade sausage hash and mac n cheese. The hash was phenomenal - the sausage tasted so fresh, not processed or overly salty, and the balance of the bold hash flavors with the cooling effect of the avocado and crema served as a garnish was a perfect compliment. I think they also make their own fruit jams - the strawberry jam was divine! My husband got the spicy belly benny and I know he enjoyed it thoroughly. I love that they use a lot of local ingredients and or dishes are made from scratch, you can really taste the difference. It was well worth the 40 min wait! I will definitely come back to drop a few dimes at the Dime Store again!"
5 star rating,"My husband and I did not have reservation , we waited about 29 mins for a table on Monday for lunch. It was very busy , but service is good and tables turn quickly. The food was good. We had the bbq chicken hash and a BLT sandwich. All delicious! We would go back if we lived here!"
5 star rating,The team at Dime Store did an excellent job and made things right.  We went back to the restaurant last week and had a great time and the food was great.
5 star rating,Two of us were here for brunch today.   When we came in it was a bit crowded so we told them we were good for a table or the bar.  We double checked with the hostess 15 minutes later and she acknowledged our request for first available.  10 minutes later a single came in and got into the cue with us.  Then two people left the bar so we were heading in when the hostess told us she was going to let the single ahead of us....excuse us....what?  She let someone who came in after us ahead of us....even though there were two seats available for us....not right!Just to be clear...there was no mistake that the single came in after us...we were right there next to him during his discussion with the  hostess.  Because we were a little upset with this...we questioned the hostess at the time and she replied that it was policy that she seats singles first.  If that is not you policy then we were discriminated against by the hostess.  I'm Not sure what you can do to make it up to us...we did have to eat elsewhere.
1 star rating,I had Eggs Benedict with steak and onions. Very very good. The only down side to this place is the wait. The restaurant is very small. But to me it was worth the wait for sure.
5 star rating,"If you want a nice breakfast come to this little hidden gem in the Chrysler building!The energy is great, lunch is decently sized but the eggs Benedict is where it is at (and the fact they serve soup in a coffee cup is pretty cool too) The only reason I couldn't give it a 5 is because it's a hit or miss with the wait staff and the length of time to get food"
4.5 star rating,"Wow ... I not a fan of thinking a restaurant which is only a couple years old could be that good but this one has it going on! The employees were superstars and the food outstanding. My wife had a mimosa and said it was the best she ever drank. The bacon truffle fries were something like I have never had before and we have eaten in almost every major area of the country. The prices were great, especially for the quality of food. The only negative might be the wait as the lines are long but they have a nice lounge area where you can wait and the time seemed to go quickly."
5 star rating,"This place is great!! The Brussel Sprout salad was so tasty, fresh, and very filling. I also enjoyed the atmosphere and staff is friendly and helpful. I definitely recommend this to anyone new to the area for a quick bite to eat."
5 star rating,I really enjoyed this place and the people in it. It was a great mix of demographics and buzzing the Saturday morning we went. At 9:30 a table for 6 had a half hour wait. When we left there were probably 30 people waiting for a table - and it is a small place. I am giving it a 4 because I didn't love the coffee - it was way too bitter for my taste and I enjoy strong coffee - I couldn't finish it. I had the Frenchman's Hash which was a special. Really original and fun. Come with an appetite and enjoy. The blueberry preserves for the English muffin was awesome as well!!
4 star rating,Usually crowded during lunch hour on weekday but food is good overall. One star knocked for service since I think it can be improved. Not bad but noticed that service is usually slower than the norm.
4 star rating,"Have been here twice to pick up takeout (their chicken salad sandwich is amazing!).The service is great, I love the space, and the food is worth driving for.Will be back again and again!"
4 star rating,"Need to return to get a good review going, I enjoyed the bar tender and the vodka.....needles to say ....the food is a blur. I feel cheated I do not remember the food. Nice cozy place."
4 star rating,very cool place. the eggs Benny was awesome. if i had to deduct it would be from myself as i was sitting at the bar and knocked over like 15 glasses. they were very nice i felt horrible.
5 star rating,"Went for the first time today for lunch but ordered the smoked salmon breakfast sandwich. It's lunch hour, I understand but the front of the house was a hot mess. One lady had to be refunded for waiting over 30 mins for her order. I had to wait an additional 10 minutes for my carry out. The food was excellent though, will try again maybe on the weekend and update my review..."
3 star rating,"Easily the best breakfast I've had in Detroit.  After risking life, limb, and automobile alignment travelling to Rose's only to be turned away by the incredibly courteous ""maître de"" who told me and my partner to ""seriously, get out of the doorway and wait in your car for us to text you,"" we headed back downtown to try DS and have yet to find anything comparable in the metro area.  Any variation of eggs benny that they're offering will do the trick, and all of their sandwiches are unbeatable for the price.  No need to drive to Birmingham for a brunch option any longer."
5 star rating,"The dime store is so delicious!!! I've been here twice now and I'm addicted! Both times we had a big brunch group. They not only fit us in with a reasonable wait time, they provided EXCELLENT service! Fast, great food, attentive oh and did I mention delicious?! Go here asap!"
4.5 star rating,"Delicious omelet, Bloody Mary, nitro cold brew but what really hits 5 stars was the service. Christina was amazing!  Will definitely be back."
5 star rating,Staff was very friendly and the food was fresh and inspired.  I enjoyed the duck hash and pork Belly Benedict with Jalapeño Pesto sauce.
4 star rating,Been meaning to order eggs Benedict so when I saw the cheesesteak on the menu I had to try it.   And I'm glad I did it was perfectly done and very flavorful.   I will certainly be back.   Service was great place was breakfast busy but I did not have to wait for my meal and the waiter was very nice good vibe at this place.
5 star rating,"Came across this place when i was looking for the best brunch in downtown detroit and am i glad i did. There were 6 of us and we were quoted a wait time of 45 minutes. We were willing to wait since we could have coffee and sit down in the lobby. Surprisingly after only 20 minutes we were sat and had menus in hand. Win!!  We ordered and our food came quickly as did our drinks. Everything was delicious. In my opinion the best thing we tried was the hangover burger. The beermosa with soft parade was refreshing,  different and yummy. The service was also exceptional, especially because it was so busy. Glad we tried this place out and will definitely be back. Thanks for a great experience!!"
5 star rating,Love the Duck Boo. Atmosphere is cool and freindly also.. Best place for Sunday Brunch.
5 star rating,"Dime Store is my go-to brunch spot Downtown. Love the variety of drink options and the daily specials! I've tried several menu items now and enjoyed them all - I think the Duck Bop Hash is my favorite. I wish the Benedicts were a little bigger portion, but if I order a side of potatoes it's always enough food.If you come on a Saturday or Sunday, be prepared to wait a while. In my experience, the host/hostess is not always accurate when quoting wait times - I once waited over an hour when I was originally told 30 mins. Knowing this, I usually stop by and put my name in then swing by the Roasting Plant or Dessert Oasis for a coffee and then come back to wait. The wait is worth it!"
4 star rating,"Been here 2 times on a Saturday for breakfast and once for lunch. Each time the meal was perfect. The presentation is beautiful and when you see others get their orders, you'll wanna know what they're having so you can get that next time. Wish I worked Downtown so I could eat here more often!!"
5 star rating,"So unimpressed and underwhelmed! I heard nothing but great things about this place and I was extremely disappointed. They brought me the wrong order three times. I was extremely polite and the guy serving me still had an attitude...like I was personally attacking him or something. I just wanted my food the way I ordered it. When I did get my food it had no flavor. I took two bites of my omelette and I was still charged full price for a meal I did not eat. I could've made something 10x better at home, so that's what I'll do next time. Some of the worst service I've ever received. Such a let down."
1 star rating,"It was a small space, but with really cool decor. The wait was maybe 5 minutes, and the hostess and waiter were both cordial and very helpful. We were seated by the window, which was awesome. I've had better coffee than this place, but the Irish coffee was delicious. The cheesesteak benny was amazing! The portion was perfect and the side of fruit didn't make the meal feel too heavy or anything. I'd come back."
4 star rating,"Really cool brunch place that had the best fries and truffle mayo in the world! Very good service as well. The wait was very long though so make sure to consider that before going on a weekend. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because out of 3 orders on our table, the grilled cheese was very underwhelming and a little burnt."
4.5 star rating,Great breakfast!!!  Probably my favorite breakfast in detroit.  Usually pretty busy as the place is very small.  Has a small bar that doesn't seat many.
5 star rating,"Really cute, fun little diner.  Good service, great benny and hot coffee!  It is so nice to see places like this pop up in Detroit!  Great beer selection too"
5 star rating,A fantastic place for breakfast.  Staff was super friendly and service was quick.  I had the duck bop which was a great blend of flavors with some spice thrown in.  Also at the table we had the French toast and waffle with good reviews.  I would go back for sure.  My only negative would be just okay coffee.
5 star rating,"Waited about an hour for a party of two, I  would say it's worth the wait. The eggs Salmon Benedict and cheesesteak eggs Benedict were on point."
4 star rating,Dime never ceases to impress. The Korean BBQ sandwich and their seasonal watermelon gazpacho were amazingggg
5 star rating,"Awesome shrimp and grits and the breakfast burger was ridiculous!!!!! Yes, yes and yes...we got here around 9:45 on Sat am - good timing...sat right away, coffee and food done by 10:30..."
5 star rating,SOOOOOO GOOOODDDD!!!! the kbbq fries and sandwich are my favorite. Went with my family and everyone enjoyed whatever they got. Such a good spot
5 star rating,We stopped in for dinner on the way to a Wings game & were extremely impressed with the food here !! Big mistake if you don't try this place out !
5 star rating,"Came in with a small appetite, so I had the small Korean fries, found these tasty, perfect amount of sweet and heat. Wish the fries had more pickled veggies mixed into the fries, near the bottom of the bowl. My wife had the breakfast burrito, this was worthy of three star rating."
3 star rating,"Really cool ""joint"" in the historic Dime Building. Two out of three of us ""hated"" the coffee. My sister and I split the duck confit hash with over easy eggs and it was good. The English muffin had the consistency of cardboard, though the rye toast was good. My b/f's burrito was good."
4.5 star rating,"I've been here a few times for brunch, and it's always been good. Nothing outstanding, but good! I don't really think it's worth the wait (usually almost an hour wait on the weekends), but it's one of the better spots if you're looking for brunch/breakfast in Detroit."
3 star rating,"I stopped in for a quick bite in the morning. They seemed busy which is good to see as they just recently opened. I stood in line for about 10 minutes, ordered steel cut oatmeal, it came with 'fresh fruit, almonds and brown sugar'. It was ready in less than 3 minutes. When it comes to oatmeal I'm sure it's made ahead of time, so I'm not sure how fresh it was. It wasn't bad, but then again I got the most bland item you can order on the menu. The reason I am giving a 3 star, is because I was expecting more fresh fruit but I only got 10 blueberries. The oatmeal was just ok. I'm definitely coming back and giving another review because their menu looks very appealing :)"
3 star rating,"Second visit yesterday afternoon, fabulous brunch and the service is still fantastic. All staff are kind, thoughtful and efficient!! The truffle oil, lardon's and Parmesan  fries are delicious!!"
5 star rating,"A MUST! Great food, worth a wait to get a table. Food came out with good timing. Service staff were polite, confident and knowledgeable about the food and drinks. We actually had the best meal since Paris, France June 2014. Duck Confit Reuben, Pork Belly Eggs Benedict and fabulous french fries with lardons, asiago cheese and a truffle mayo dipping sauce was prepared with perfections. We did choose the highest fat food, but well worth the indulgence. One excellent option on the menu was that they word serve each sandwich on as a salad instead of in the bread. very accomodating. They mood, climate and happiness of this place was great but not too overdone, just right. There is a service bar for optional seating. We cannot wait t go back and take friends and family. We feel like we found a treasure!!"
5 star rating,Awesome breakfast food.  Brioche french toast  served with strawberries and bananas was very good and not too sweet.  Restaurant was very busy but service was great and food arrived quickly.
5 star rating,So my girlfriend recommended we go here for lunch and I found out quickly that this place is tight as fuck. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and my mouth is pregnant with a little love baby. If I ever plan to impress anybody with food that isn't mine I'll come here. I'm rolling s/o our waitress s/o the chef s/o my mouth.
5 star rating,All the reviews are spot on. The veggie hash was excellent. Make sure to try the home made jam.
5 star rating,"The Dime Store is a perfect place to get a delicious meal at a reasonable price. The restaurant has a clean, welcoming environment which is suitable for all ages. For my party of four, our food arrived together fresh in a timely fashion. The food was bold in flavour and left us wanting to try each others meals.Staff was courteous and the restrooms within the establishment were well maintained. Anyone looking to have a wholesome meal The Dime Store is the place to go."
5 star rating,"Some of the best food I've ever had. Got the duck Reuben, which didn't taste like a Reuben but all the flavors and textures were uniquely balanced. It's definitely worth the wait if there is one."
5 star rating,"Dime Store did definitely live up to my expectations of a new, hipster Detroit brunch spot. The menu is simple and unique, the service was great, and the ambiance was very industrial and fits the new vibe of downtown Detroit. I got the duck-bop hash.The first 2/3 of the dish was amazing, but after awhile, the sweet sauce started to cover up all the other flavors of the dish.  I kind of wish the sauce came on the side or have the sauce be slightly more savory. I loved the peach mimosa, it was a refreshing change as compared to the classic OJ and champagne. The price isn't cheap, but still not ridiculous. I definitely hope to go back some time."
4 star rating,"Best omelette I have had in years.  Fluffy eggs, not burnt, chunks of bacon...  Bacon avocado omelette!!"
4.5 star rating,"Came back on the 31st waited an hour to be seated but well worth it, I love this place. My son wasn't to thrilled being charged $5 for a cup of OJ that came straight out of a jug of Florida's Best that cost $3.19 a half gallon at the market."
5 star rating,What a gem in downtown Detroit. I can recommend all of the hash dishes perfectly cooked fried eggs I only wish they did poached. One small complaint was that my daughter in law thought the cauliflower gruyere soup could have used more cheese. Compliment your selves on a well trained staff.We will be back especially since my son lives 2 blocks away.
5 star rating,"I wrote a review of this place yesterday as I believed they over charge for their orange juice. I'm sure some people read it and thought I was an idiot that didn't know anything about the industry or simple economics. Well I can tell you that might be true, I have said many dumb things in my life and have never worked in the industry. Well following my 1 star posting, which really was only to see if someone might respond to me, I got a chance to talk to the owner. It was a good exchange and not one of those angry ""you don't know what you're talking about"" Buzzfeed ""articles"" you may see. It impressed me and now I feel I can give this place a much more deserving 5 stars than the 1 I gave it less then 24 hours ago. I can't wait to go back with my family and friends who love this place, along with what seemed to be most of the city of Detroit."
5 star rating,"I can not sing this places praises loudly enough. Great vibe. Fantastic service. Surprisingly brief wait for a Sunday morning. And, the food. The food!! I had the Camote Sash (one of the chef's specials), and I kid you not - this is the best brunch food I've had in the city. Wonderful flavors. Perfectly prepared. Such a lovely portion (not too small, not too big). Don't let the wait reviews deter you. Grab yourself a cup of coffee (and maybe a chocolate from bon bon bon) and sit yourself in the comfy lobby area - it's worth it."
5 star rating,"Wait is real on the weekend but once you're seated, good breakfast awaits you! I love their egg benedict. I think it's so perfect. Espresso bar isn't as impressive as i expected but food is serious. Nice big portion also."
4 star rating,"Wow!!!!!!!!! The food was outstanding! Our bartender/server was everything we could have hoped for, being two kids from Ohio trekking into enemy territory. Big Mike was big, bearded and so incredibly fun. Our experience matched the taste of the food. This will be our favorite place to eat IF we step foot in -ichigan again!!! Well done Dime Store, well done!!"
5 star rating,"Attended on a Thursday evening, only about 6 tables were occupied and service was a little slow. We had to wait a while just for water refills but besides that the food was great. I highly recommend the Duck Reuben, it was delicious."
5 star rating,"Very reliable lunch / dinner spot with reasonably priced drinks. If you prefer healthier options or heavier ones, they have delicious things on their menu that will cover it. Great service too!"
4 star rating,I love this place. The services is good and the staff is friendly. The turkey sausage sandwich is really good.
5 star rating,Had the Duck Rueben today for lunch was one of the best sandwiches I ever had.  Great bread fresh flavors from the cabbage and arugula with a wonderful sauce.  The duck confit had great flavor and just the right amount of ingredients on the sandwich.  Wonderful service in a hip atmosphere downtown in the Chrysler house.
5 star rating,El toro Benny was super yummy but did not completely blow me away. Also seems to get very busy. Before seating us they asked us to order and eat quickly which was a bit off putting.
4.5 star rating,"Korean BBQ sandwich was awesome.   Omelet a were awesome.  Everything here is awesome.   This is a must stop place, hipster or not"
5 star rating,"I absolutely loved this place!!! The brunch is amazing and honestly worth the wait. If you can, make reservations. If you can't, it is still worth waiting in the hotel (?) lobby. Everything is delicious and the service is great!"
5 star rating,"There's a host at the door. Put your name in. Waited at least 10 min to put name down while host walked past me multiple times without saying a word. food was not as good as expected. had the duck bimbop hash and duck rueben. Hash was cut up french fries and some of it didn't seem super fresh. The bimbop hash was bimbop bc it had pickled dikon, pickled cucumber and siracha. Just not impressed by it. duck rueben was a little better. Did have mustard seeds in it, which made it a little strong. garlic parmesean fries were ok, I've had better. Had the same french fries as the hash. Vanilla chi tea latte was very good and the beer mosa was tasty. pretty noisy inside."
2 star rating,"Great food, great atmosphere. Long wait for tables though if you don't have a reservation. Duck bop is great!"
5 star rating,"Detroit really surprised me in having a great food scene. Dime Store shouldn't be missed. They take great care in delivering stellar food and notice all the details. They open early for breakfast and I was lucky enough to have a business breakfast there. Everything was divine, right down to the two types of jam that were presented. Service was attentive and the vibe was great. Go here."
5 star rating,Pretty good food... Loved the fries with bacon. Chicken salad sandwich was decent... It was quiet a wait for food.... But overall a good experience
3 star rating,"Quick lunch here during the week.  Food was tremendous, service was incredibly prompt and very friendly.  My wife just had gotten a job promotion, and upon hearing this they brought out their signature chocolate chip cornbread on the house.  Nice move!  Keep it up."
5 star rating,"Came to this spot for brunch. Very friendly and attentive staff, the manager performed a table touch. I had no issues in my experience and if I lived here I would eat here often."
5 star rating,"I've eaten here twice and both times have been good. I am a big fan of brunch, particularly eggs benedict. The first time was the best; egg cooked perfectly and smoked salmon was delicious. The second time I went it was a lot busier which I think did compromise the food a bit. I got the eggs benedict on special and it was good but not perfect, egg was a bit overcooked and it had chorizo that was kinda dry. I would definitely go back again to try the next special though. You do need to keep a lookout as you walk down the street or you may miss the place."
4 star rating,"TL;DR The wait for brunch is worth it.  And it's not an uncomfortable wait either.  Located inside the Chrysler House building, the columned atrium has tables, chairs, and plenty of floor space to relax while waiting for a table.  I only wish that cocktails or a more available coffee service was an option to fill the time before seating opened up.Service was quick after seated and the staff were knowledgeable of the dishes and drinks.  Neither overly friendly or too hip to smile, the hostess and bartenders were excellent.I had the duck bop, a confit duck hash with eggs and English muffin.  It was tasty, seasoned well with a sweet sauce.  To drink I had a bloody mary, which was simple, served without a garnish, using local brand Tito's vodka.  The service was prompt.  If I could give any criticism of the food, looking around, many dishes seem to lean too heavily into sriracha sauce and that I like a nice garnish with my bloody mary, nothing too fancy, a pickle or some giardiniera.Prices were reasonable for good food. $12 bucks for a fairly big breakfast cooked well.  Like I said earlier, for an $8 bloody mary I was hoping for a bit more than mix and vodka.  Overall, give it a go.  It's great to see some more options open up downtown, and I'm planning on making this a regular spot to grab a bite to eat."
4.5 star rating,"Wow, I wish this restaurant was closer to home.  Loved the vietnamese fries, chicken and pesto sandwich but the true winner was the pork belly benedict.  WOW!"
5 star rating,"Winner. Duck confit has was outstanding. Attentive and prompt service. Appropriate price points and sizes, especially for drinks (unlike Townhouse, their Bloody Marys are a ripoff). We'll be back."
5 star rating,Food was great. cauliflower cheddar soup was life. MIKE the bartender was far above an average bartender and his Big Irish was efficient and most delicious
5 star rating,This was a great spot to have breakfast! My family enjoyed the environment and the wait was shorter than they told us. Our waiter was attentive and they accommodated our large family.
5 star rating,Great food. Good service. Refreshing addition to the downtown lunch spots.
5 star rating,"OK food, but a bit pricey. Also not quite worth battling the effort to get here if you're not already in the area. It's good, just nothing to rave about."
3 star rating,Great locally sourced food. Given their location it's shocking (and frustrating) that they only open at 8am. They are in the business district and around the corner from a very large Westin hotel. This place really needs to start opening at 7am to be a viable breakfast option for business travelers and alike downtown. If they opened at 7am I would be here every day.
5 star rating,"I don't write reviews: good or bad. But I have to say that Dime Store is amazing. My sister had her bridal shower there 2 months ago. I can't say enough about how above and beyond the owners and staff went to make it a great day. I'm so glad we were able to show people, who normally wouldn't head down to the D, how awesome it actually is. I've already been telling people to check you out."
5 star rating,Great food I think this might be one of my top choices for brunch but the wait is always 45 minutes at a minimum. Not a bad area to wait tho so just go with your Starbucks and plan to sit awhile in the lobby plenary of room to sit and talk. Highly recommend
5 star rating,The food is good.  Consistently good.   Appeals to most palates and eating habits.  Never ever had bad service.  What sucks is the typical wait.   The one upside is waiting in the atrium with good company is entirely delightful.   Please note that you can hit Drought and Bon a Bon Bon on the way out (or in)
4.5 star rating,Not sure if I should write this review as the wait keeps getting longer at this place but I must say it is definitely the best breakfast/brunch place downtown.  Try the smoked salmon Benny and Brussels sprouts as a side.
5 star rating,I came in here on a sunday the wait was about 40 minutes but it was well worth it. I started with the beer mossa and the cauliflower soup which was yummy . I ordered the duck hash which I have a feeling might have been cooked a bit wrong because it was swimming in a liquid sauce that had this over powering housein sauce flavor. The duck was very tender and fresh tasting. No complaints on the service its was very good. I would love to go back and try the other menu items.
4 star rating,Pretty good... Found this place on Yelp  cool location from my hotel. Loved the local grown veggies..  Just had a chicken sandwich but the marmalade was fantastic ;) don't remember my servers name but he was nice.
4 star rating,"Don't ever come here if you any other time commitments. The service is extremely slow, the restaurant is always busy, but the food is super tasty and unique compared to the other options in that area of Detroit (well, unless the food trucks are in Cadillac Square). The prices are comparable to other sit-down restaurants down-town."
4 star rating,"Let me just say the food was yummy. But not yummy enough to remove the stain left my the service we received from the bartender. He was rude, he yelled for our order (mind you we were seated at a table) from across the bar. He made it very apparent that our being there was an annoyance, as such I don't see myself ever returning."
2 star rating,Great food. nice atmosphere. intimate. very good service. wait in the lobby while reviewing the menu. Really good bacon. would definitely go back!!
5 star rating,"Visiting Detroit from Dayton,Ohio and decided to try Dime Store out after a night of fun. It was an awesome atmosphere and the duck confit hash was amazing. I want to lick my sisters plate. I got the pork belly Benny which was delicious, but the side arugula salad was a little boring. Would absolutely return and make sure to have a beermosa with your brunch."
5 star rating,I usually hate ordering salads at restaurants (especially when there's sandwiches) but I took the waiters advice and got the Korean BBQ as a salad instead of the sandwich...and dang it was good. The happy hour deals are pretty good too. Would def come back for their brunch!
5 star rating,"Solid, savory breakfast/brunch/lunch place. I've gone a dozen times; it is one of my basic morning recommendations in the downtown Detroit area. Absolutely wonderful omelets."
5 star rating,"We were exploring downtown Detroit on a weekend trip and this restaurant was in walking distance from our Hotel.  We enjoyed our breakfasts; I had a Smoked Salmon and Egg Sandwich which was rich with plenty of cream cheese and fresh arugula-ish salad if I recall correctly.  In any case we were there early on a Saturday morning and it was very busy, but the service was great and so was the atmosphere.  There were so many things I wanted to try on the menu, I'd be happy to go back here next time I'm in Detroit.  I love the Chrysler House Lobby too."
4.5 star rating,Oh my! The bacon avocado omelette is divine.  Best omelette I've ever had.   Husband had the sausage hash and cleaned his plate.  Good coffee too.  We make the trip special from the burbs for their breakfast.
5 star rating,"I walked up to the Dime Store looking for some nice Breakfast. My call was greeted by a 40 minute wait, there was a wait yes, but it was worth it. I was shown to a table. My server was nice she gave me a menu to look at what they had, I ordered the smokes salmon harry. It was a gift from the heavens, something worth the  wait. It was awesome, if you are near the Dime Shop, I would recommend it for anyone near it out of town, it was a great experience."
5 star rating,"Love love love the arugula salad. It's incredible. But everything here is!! Made with very fresh, high quality and often local ingredients, you really can't go wrong here."
5 star rating,"So good! The food was just awesome. I had the brioche French toast and I almost ate all of it!!! Also, get a side of bacon with anything you order, you will not be disappointed! Loved the location, very old school yet modern, if that even makes sense. Will gladly come back the next time we are in town."
5 star rating,"Came here on a Sunday morning for brunch with friends and didn't have to wait too long. This place isn't very big, but has a friendly atmosphere. It was kind of loud, but it is a brunch spot after all. Service was great and the food was even better. I ordered a small order of Korean fries which were awesome!  We contemplated ordering a second, but decided not to since we had breakfast coming shortly. I ordered the duck hash which was excellent!  It had a nice spicy kick too it and the egg was cooked perfect.  My friends that I was with enjoyed their food too. Almost everybody finished their meals - so it must have been good. The drinks were so so. Some ordered mimosas and others ordered bloody Mary's.  For the price of the drinks, I expected better, especially from the bloody Mary's. Overall, I really enjoyed this place!  I will definitely be back!"
4 star rating,"Yum yum yummy! Recently moved to Detroit and have been looking for some restaurants to replace the tasty feasts I had in Chicago. Dime store is the place. The wait can be very long, but the food is worth it. Great brunch!"
4 star rating,Great breakfast. The pork belly eggs benedict was delicious.  French toast looked very good.  Great service by Scott our server too.
5 star rating,"I went here a few weeks ago for Sunday brunch. I got some skillet with sausage and avocado and it was delicious. It was flavorful, and very filling. The atmosphere was and warm. I nice new place to brunch."
4 star rating,Good breakfast/ brunch stop in the Chrysler Welcome House bldg.  Hostess will call your name as you wait in the comfortable lobby.  Sit down in a crowded space to a nice brunch.  Have a Bloody Mary.  The standard offerings are nice (we tried the duck hash) as are the specials (we tried the pork belly Benedict).  Only drawback: Zingermann's coffee-universally a disappointing brew despite the famous name.
4 star rating,My wife and I went there for breakfast on a Sunday morning.  It was busy but they were able to quickly seat us at the counter.  Big Mike waited on us and was a blast!  The coffee was from Zingerman's.  A little bitter but still very good.  I got the sausage hash and it was fantastic.  Everything was well prepared and the spicy ketchup was incredible.  I would definitely order it again.  My wife built her own omelet and liked it very much.  We will definitely go back.
4.5 star rating,"OMG!! This place is amazing!!! Busy on a Sunday at noon but the wait went quickly since there's lots of comfy atrium seating.  We had Zingerman's coffee and the delicious peach mimosas (which by the way was the largest mimosa I've ever been served.)  Some of the BEST breakfasts we have ever eaten...the Duck Bop Hash and the Spicy Bely Benny we're so totally awesome.  You should go ASAP, you will not be disappointed!"
5 star rating,Wow!  Wonderful food & great service. I had the pork belly eggs benedict which were pretty darn close to the best I've ever had-if not the best. The bowl of fruit it came with was absolutely delicious. I will definitely be going here again and bringing friends! :-D
5 star rating,"It says something about a place when you stop in for breakfast and drag a friend back the same day for a late lunch.  OK, in fairness, it could say that there are limited options in your area but that's not the case at all here!  Breakfast was a BLTE (bacon, lettuce, tomato and egg - with spicy mayo) and an Americano to go.  They were jumpin' at 10:30 when I went; but my coffee was made immediately and the wait wasn't long at all for the sandwich.It felt long - but only because I kept watching all of the food I *didn't* get coming out to other diners.  Everything look as good as (or better than) the pictures on the website and I wanted it all.My sandwich was fantastic.  Eggs are simple things, deceptively so.  Anyone can cook an egg.  But it takes real skill to perfectly cook one.  And this was.  The white was well set but the yolk was still gooey and velvety but not so much that any of it ran out of the sandwich.The only thing that I would say is that the mayo could have been a little spicier.  But that's really a minor ding.  It was truly excellent.Fast forward a couple of hours and a friend texts me that he's starving.  Hey that's as good an excuse as any!  They were still pretty full at 2:45 but we got right in, got a table and ordered a mimosa and a beermosa.  We decided to start with the pork rinds.Everything else could be terrible (but it's not!) and I would STILL come back here for those pork rinds.  Amazing!  Crunchy and fresh and with that Korean sauce on them?  That sauce went astonishingly well with the rinds.  The serving is huge for the price, too.After we polished those off, we got our bennys.  Philly Cheesesteak for my friend and Pork Belly for me.  And again, perfect cooked eggs - all four of them.  We did find it lacked salt but decided that that was less that the benedicts needed salt and more that we'd just eaten that huge thing of salty/spicy pork rinds.  Next time we'll reverse that order and I'm sure all will be well.The staff were great - working like crazy but still managed to be extremely friendly and attentive and looking more laid-back than harried.And the prices were really reasonable for what you get.We're already planning on when we're going to bring our co-workers for lunch.  And then possibly after work for more pork rinds and beers.  Maybe even on the same day!It's that kind of place."
5 star rating,Heard about Dime Store so we checked it out. I had the Korean bbq sandwich which was a little on the small side. I enjoyed the coleslaw could've been more meat but overall it was good.
3 star rating,"One of the best breakfast joints I've visited. Had the bacon avocado omelette and it was excellent. Combined with the BEST sausage patties I've ever tasted, Dime Store makes this a must stop for anyone visiting Detroit. Be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes as seating is very limited. But it's worth the wait!"
5 star rating,"Perfect place for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. Menu consists of the standard waffles, french toast and omelets but also unique twists like cheesesteak bennys and duck hash. The veggie hash with eggs over easy on top was delicious! The staff was exceptionally friendly and coffee(Zingermans) brewed to perfection.There is also a lunch menu and a full bar. I will definitely return !"
5 star rating,A fairly good option if you want a veggie burger on a weeknight. The side salad I ordered was filled with good greens and a tasty dressing. Service was speedy and the wait staff friendly.
4 star rating,"I finally made it to this place after hearing from everyone I know about how fantastic it is. Everything I heard and read about is true. This place is great! I love the decor, the staff is super friendly and knowledgable and the food is out of this world good. I will be back for the cheesesteak Benny. I'm a huge eggs Benedict lover and this has probably the best poached egg I've ever had. The sausage hash was very tasty as well. I'll be back to try the other Benedicts too."
5 star rating,A regular go to spot located in my office building at the Chrysler House.  The Korean beef sandwich or salad are yummy along with their breakfast variety of hash.  Usually busy but order ahead for a take-out.
4 star rating,Best brunch place in Detroit. Get the smoked salmon Benny or the sandwich. You won't regret it
4.5 star rating,Small little restaurant. Went for brunch on a Sunday. Didn't have to wait very long for a table. Maybe like ten minutes. We ordered the bacon Parmesan fries which were SO good. The small portion was more than enough for two people. I also got a chocolate flavored latte which I enjoyed. I ordered the avocado and tomato egg sandwich and like that a lot. Wasn't loving the side of sausage I got though. I like links but I didn't know these were like thick patties and the flavor was just a little too different for me. My friend ordered one of the eggs Benedict dishes. The menu seemed like it had good variety. I would definitely return to this place!
5 star rating,"Fantastic eats! The kind of meal you chew slowly and savor every bite! We tried the bacon, parm, truffle fries and the spicy Korean fries. The quality of the bacon and shaved Korean style meat is TOP-NOTCH! So flavorful, and don't be put-off by the ""spicy"" in the Korean style fries. It was not really spicy at all, in fact the marinade was perfect, made the meat taste almost candied. The sriracha was subtle, not overpowering. The duck ruben was perfect, I savored every bite. My mother thoroughly enjoyed her cup of tortilla soup, I tried it also and we agreed it was the best we've ever had. There is cilantro in the soup, so if you don't like it, ask to have it made without; we thought it gave the perfect amount of ""kick"" though. The corned beef and hash plate was thoroughly enjoyed as was my brother's cheese steak sandwich. Wait service by Christina(sp?) was excellent, very personal and friendly! Thanks for a memorable lunch! We hope to be back soon and we will highly recommend your restaurant to everyone!"
5 star rating,"Amazing breakfast, great decor. Definitely get the duck bop - we all kept reaching over and stealing from the guy who ordered that. Close second the cheesesteak benny! Will definitely come back when in Detroit."
5 star rating,"Had a very well prepared quiche. Good coffee, good location and good service. It's what you want in a breakfast place. Enjoy!"
5 star rating,Came here for a girls brunch and we got seated in the nice long table area. Of course there was a wait on a Saturday but everyone was very nice and friendly. Food & service was totally worth it and delicious!!!
5 star rating,"Everything was amazing, and we had a lot! We ordered and enjoyed: duck Reuben, French toast, sausage hash, chocolate croissant, chocolate chip cookie and a French vanilla latte. Each bite was exceptional!!"
5 star rating,"Best work lunch I've had in a while! I had the duck confit Reuben and Korean BBQ fries. Incredible!  Ingredients were fresh,  portions were reasonable, it wasn't too loud for work environment. Thoroughly enjoyed it! Can't wait to go back for Happy Hour or brunch!"
5 star rating,"Excellent spot, with very good above average food and very reasonable prices.  Cheerful and attentive staff, clever menu and good drinks.  Fun spot for brunch (which is when we went) and an overall good vibe.  A little small for larger groups if you cant snag the big picnic table type place in the corner"
5 star rating,"Really enjoyed my first experience here. Took out my lunch but got a glimpse inside. Really cute, charming interior. Staff was so courteous and entertaining. I can't wait to return and try more things. I had the chicken salad sandwich with fries and truffle mayo. Fresh food. Grand flavors. Woo!!"
5 star rating,"Ordered a sandwich and misunderstood the wait time involved. They were particularly busy this morning and I had to run off to a meeting before picking up my food. When I went back, the staff was incredibly helpful. The manager was kind, and offered me a complimentary drink while I waited. The cook/expeditor came out and personally handed me the food and apologized. We both knew it was more my fault than his, but he was still extremely gracious. The sandwich was delicious. I went to Dime Store because of recommendations of friends, and they met the reputation that they've carved out for themselves as a business. High, high praise goes to the employees. They, along with the delicious food, won over a new customer."
4.5 star rating,"I brought my family here for brunch before going to the auto show. We walked by the doors and saw that it was packed! We were greeted pleasantly at the door expecting a long wait for 5, but we were seated immediately! Staff was great and speedy. And the food! Brunch is my fav, so it doesn't take much to please me, but everythang was on point!!! I got the sausage hash, eggs yolks were perfectly oozy, no need for extra salt and pepper. Even my English muffin was perfectly buttered and whatever jam was on the side was so good!  I will be back with more frands!!!!"
5 star rating,Love this place.  Pork belly eggs Benedict and Korean fries are awesome.  Reasonably priced for the quality of food.  Friendly wait staff too
5 star rating,Food was great. Shared 2 plates with my friend. We ordered french toast and an omelette to share. The french toast was pretty amazing. We sat at the bar and talked to the bartender who added much to our our experience.
4 star rating,I was so excited to try this place! But it was a total let down. We ordered the spicy bulgogi kimchi fries and philly cheese steak Benny. The Benny was totally bland and the English muffin was hard to cut into... Must have been over toasted. Our fries tasted like card board! The bulgogi meat and sauce tasted good but the fries tasted stale and hard. So disappointing. The pictures on Yelp looked so good too bad it didn't taste the way it looked...
1 star rating,"Really solid brunch offerings.  Eaten here at least 2 or 3 times, the first time right after they opened.  I like everything I've tried, but I think the things that really shine, the stuff worth highlighting and stopping in for, are their brunch options.  Their creative hash and eggs benedict creations both are well worth ordering.  If you're there for a lunch or evening, the loaded fries have some pretty tasty combinations.  For dinner...it wouldn't be my first choice, though I have had a good evening there with friends, drinks, and their more dinner friendly meals.  But on the odd weekday off, looking for a good place for a filling, late breakfast at a reasonable price, I'd definitely stop by the Dime Store.  Good service, good atmosphere, solid food creations."
4 star rating,An excellent spot for lunch downtown! The beer & squash sandwich was great (don't miss the fries!). Definitely going back to try the Mac and cheese.
5 star rating,"A little bit on the loud side, but festive nonetheless ... and the food ... amazing!  Sat at the bar and watched all the food being made ... incredible variety."
5 star rating,"This place never disappoints. The customer service is stellar. My wife and I always feel welcomed, and that the staff is ready to make us feel as if we're eating in our own home. Sadly though, we can't cook the way the chefs at Dime Store do. As much as I'd like to try the variety of options on the menu, I usually go with the Duck Bap. How can you go wrong with duck, fried egg, potatoes, siracha, etc. all on one plate as a way to start one's day? The beer and coffee selection I stop notch as well. The owners, Larry and Ann Marie, are super-friendly, funny, and great hosts.  Because of them, and obviously the food, our go to place every time we visit family in Detroit, is Dime Store."
5 star rating,"I've been here twice, once soon after it opened (before they had a liquor license) for brunch and, recently, for lunch. We actually meant to make it in for a late breakfast the second time but were running late, so lunch it was and we were pleasantly surprised! Both meals were wonderful and exceeded expectations. I'm a vegetarian and most of the new, hip restaurants that have opened in the area are meat heavy, small-plates style, which doesn't bode well for me since I can't share with others I'm eating with. Dime Store isn't like that and is my favorite of the new places I've tried so far. They have some unique, yet simple, menu items. I got the homemade veggie burger for lunch and it was so good. I'm usually wary of ordering a veggie burger at any restaurant since they're usually an afterthought, but this one had beans and grains clearly visible inside and the goat cheese, arugula and red onions gave it a nice flavor. The bun was great too. I also enjoyed the thick-cut fries that came with it. I wanted to get the cauliflower gruyere soup, but because I had hoped for breakfast, I began my lunch with a blueberry muffin and coffee instead. I'll definitely try the soup next time. The muffin was outstanding, by the way. It was charmingly misshapen and had a delicious crust while moist inside. It wasn't overly sweet like some baked goods tend to be these days, just a really great, simple blueberry muffin. My boyfriend had the duck Reuben and he could not stop raving about it, even days later. Our first time there, we both had breakfast and were impressed. I had the veggie hash and it was very flavorful. I can't remember what he had but we made a note to come back after they got a liquor license and had been open a while longer. I'm glad we did because I think I've found my new favorite brunch/lunch place in the city. I love that they're open later than most other casual places in the area."
5 star rating,"Ordered the Hangover Burger off the Chef's Special Menu, very good.Ordered the Pork Burger on bed of greens rather than bun, very good.Ordered the Korean Fries, very good. Ordered the Regular Fries, fine. Got our order wrong but they took one Fries order off to make up for it. Had to flag down another staff for refills because our waiter was so busy. Overall pleased with service anyway."
4.5 star rating,"Great place for breakfast/brunch! I came here with a couple of my friends so I was able to sample quite a bit of the menu. The food was good, but nothing spectacular. We ordered the salmon benedict, veggie hash, sausage omelet, and truffle fries. The food came out at a decent time, but our waiter wasn't attentive to us because of the busy state of the restaurant. We had to flag him down a couple of times for refills on water and for ketchup.  Although the service could be better, the menu was a lot cheaper than I thought it would be so that was a plus! And the interior is well designed! I really like the modern twist with the ""dime store"" sign in neon lights. Overall, I'd come here again for a nice brunch date :)"
3 star rating,"Stopped by breakfast last weekend on a visit to Detroit. We were looking for a brunch spot on Saturday morning and this was the closest option.We had a wait of about 20 minutes and were then seated at the bar area. The menu is fairly diverse with both breakfast and lunch options. We opted for an omelette and French toast. Both were absolutely incredible. Omelette was thick yet fluffy, filled with any toppings you desire. The French toast was amazing. Nothing complicated at all, very simple, but the flavors and spices were unlike any French toast I've tasted. Overall, I'd highly recommend Dime Store to anyone looking for a top tier brunch spot downtown."
5 star rating,This place runs so smoothly and the waitstaff are friendly attentive and efficient! I had the duck hash it was fantastic.  If i order it again I will ask for more of the great slaw on top because the best bites had both the sweet salty hash and the bright pickled veggies together.  The coffee is strong and delicious the bloody mary was perfectly spicy and not chunky or gritty like some and I love how this place uses all locally sourced goodies. AND the price is totally reasonable if not a bit low for the quality.  We will be back!
5 star rating,Went here for the first time with some friends for a Tuesday lunch. The food here is on point.
5 star rating,"I LOVE this place. They serve breakfast all day and have awesome mimosas and beermosas!It doesn't stop there! If I could stay there all day to work and eat, I would. They have amazing salads and sandwiches too. I had the PBLT (Pork Belly, Lettuce, Tomato) sandwich. It was a-mazing!Last thing: Do not leave there without having a basket of fries with their truffle mayo."
4 star rating,"I enjoyed my food here and the service was good.Came here on a Friday afternoon around 3ish. They have a tiered happy hour for 50% off drinks 3-4, 40% off 4-5, and 30% off between 5-6pm.It was pretty empty which was nice. I heard the the place can get pretty crowded on the weekends.After deliberating on the menu, I decided on getting duck confit hash.I enjoyed the duck confit hash. It came with what seemed as a pulled duck confit with chopped up potatoes cooked in some sort of a glaze. There was a characteristic sweetness to it which I felt complemented the crispy potatoes well. Also came with an English muffin with some Jam. The duck itself was a little bit drier than I was used to. You might have noticed that I mentioned that it almost seemed like a ""pulled duck"" confit. Duck confit is supposed to be a food that is cooked slowly over time within its own fat. It is supposed to be tender and moist, and not of a stringy consistency.Another caveat though, was that my egg was unevenly cooked. The hash came with two eggs over easy on top. One of the eggs was completely cooked through and the yolk was solid (shame), but my other yolk was still runny. It was a bit of a disappointment for me as I like to play with my food by breaking the yolk and mixing it up in the hash.I also got the beermosa which is basically OJ + beer. The beer selection here is a little scarce. Only had atwater dirty blonde and bells soft parade. I figured the fruitiness of the soft parade would complement the OJ well, and it did. Also had my friend's bloody mary and it was solid.Overall, I am not sure if I would wait in a long line or anything like that for the food here, as I thought it was good, but not anything particularly special. If I am in the area I will try again (which I will be). With what I had I would rate it at 3.5 stars, but I am going to round up (you should really have half stars yelp). I'll give them the benefit of the doubt until I can try some more items on the menu. Happy eats!"
4 star rating,I usually hate ordering salads at restaurants (especially when there's sandwiches) but I took the waiters advice and got the Korean BBQ as a salad instead of the sandwich...and dang it was good. The happy hour deals are pretty good too. Would def come back for their brunch!
5 star rating,"We were heading for a day trip to Detroit and figured we would have a bite to eat. Picked this place because of it's proximity to the border, and its high yelp reviews. We were freaking hungry!We came on a Saturday morning, so the place was jam packed. We had to wait for almost an hour to get a seat, which is okay. There were so many peeps there and the place was bustlin so we didn't mind. Once we got seated we ordered right away, since the menu was outside and we picked our food since we got bored! Then the annoying part came, where we has to wait like 30-40 mins for our food. Seriously? We ordered eggs and a salad! I also added a side of potatoes and they gave them to me on a cold plate... Which was weird. I gave it back and requested it be added to my main dish (isnt that supposed to be self explanatory?) nevertheless, my boyfriend says i whine too much, but the food was pretty underwhelming considering the wait time, the price and the actual food. Nothing wow, and at that point of hunger- wowing us should be easy. You should go and check it out if ur in the area, bc of the atmosphere and the cool interior, but its definitely not somewhere i would frequent more than once. On the plus side, the building its in is very old Detroit deco and the bathrooms are modern and spotless !"
3 star rating,"This place sits in a great location right in the central business district of Downtown Detroit and bleeds coolness and to add to all of that, the food is great! I enjoyed lunch here with a co-worker three days in a row. Be sure to try a cup of the cauliflower soup and the bacon parmesean truffle fries. I promise you won't be disappointed."
4 star rating,"I had been looking forward to visiting this place for a while now. Several of my friends recommended it and after reading so many positive Yelp reviews, I knew I had to see what all the fuss was about. I arranged to meet several of my favorite gals there for brunch today at eleven. We should have come earlier. When I finally located the place (it's inside the Chrysler House), I checked with the hostess to get my name on the list and to inquire about the wait time. It was 45 minutes to an hour for a table. I wasn't in a rush so I agreed and we headed over to Starbucks to kill some time. After returning, we were seated. The wait time was accurate, as we were seated after about 55 minutes. The restaurant space is cute. I like the cozy feel of the place. Our waitress promptly brought us water and took our drink orders, despite it obviously being a busy time. She was very helpful and offered her suggestions. We ordered the sausage hash with turkey sausage and I ordered the Brussels sprouts. The food took a while, which I anticipated due to the crowd. But, once it arrived, OMG! Everything was delicious. The food was hot, fresh and many of the ingredients are locally sourced. Overall, the food is delicious and the service is excellent. Just keep in mind that this place is popular so you may have a wait. Bring snacks."
4.5 star rating,What a great little spot! Everything was amazing from the ambiance to the food. Would highly recommend to anyone who appreciates everything from scratch and taste out of this world. Can't wait to come back and try some more of the creative dishes.
5 star rating,Any one of their sandwiches could easily be found at a much more expensive restaurant and served without the bun they're instantly transformed into a gourmet entree. The staff are warm and welcoming and if you were downtown and didn't stop by you had better turn around.
5 star rating,"We had breakfast at the Dime Store yesterday.  Not only did this unique establishment give a nostalgic community feel, the presentation of this breakfast, coupled with the robust full flavor of each unique dish, completely generates a warm twist to some old boring classics.  This is an experience everyone should try!  Enjoy!"
5 star rating,"Went with my friend on a weekday for lunch. (spring 2015) I thought it was ok! I think I would order breakfast next time instead of the sandwich I got which was mostly bread, and not the best. (I didn't care much for the pork belly sandwich fyi) But definitely would try again! Solid service, cool atmosphere. 7/10!"
3 star rating,"This place gets it that great food and warm hospitality go hand in hand if you are chasing success. You get a good vibe when you walk in. Four of us had breakfast - sausage hash, duck confit hash, duck reuben, and poached pear salad; bloody Marys. Their thick cut fries are tender inside crispy outside perfection. I have no complaints. The menu is inventive. The food was fresh, the flavors well developed, with a lovely presentation - very memorable. Service was freindly and attentive. We'll be back, and we'll spread the word."
5 star rating,Great place for brunch!  Got right in on a Thursday late morning.  Our waitress was so friendly and gave great service.  I ask for something that wasn't on the menu and she checked on it and the chef prepared the best corn beef hash!  I will for sure go back!
5 star rating,"5 out of 5. Delightful food, an accurate wait time and parking validation. I had the Duck Confit Hash, and the Korean BBQ fries with a two bean chili soup. For what the Dime Store is trying to be they nailed it. Service was on point and A+ especially for a busy Saturday morning."
5 star rating,Very good place to go but get there early on a weekend if you don't want to wait! Great food and service!!
4 star rating,"Yeah cute, fun and funky. God I love the old buildings in downtown Detroit. Menu is exciting, food was nothing to write home about (mom stop reading now) we tried a few of the sandwiches there was nothing particularly wrong about them. Pork belly should be absolutely delicious, this was OK. (nowhere near a say... banh mi boys, for a Toronto reference)."
4 star rating,Nice place for breakfast in a revitalizing Detroit.  Excellent freshly prepared and house made items.
4.5 star rating,"Food is really good. People are friendly. So excited new businesses are brimming in the D! One star knocked down though because the wait took forever! We had 3 people in our party and were quoted 25 minutes and weren't seating for close to an hour. I know it's not the restaurant's fault if people linger, but perhaps overestimate the wait time for your patrons."
4 star rating,Stopped by here after the Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving. Had their special that day which was an eggs benedict topped with some sort of delicious turkey cake. It was kinda like a crab cake but made out of turkey and it was really good. This place reminded me of a lot of restaurants in New Orleans! The beet salad was good but nothing to write home about. Cool place with a really nice wait staff and beautiful ambience. Will totally come again when I'm downtown.
5 star rating,Very nice place to eat. A little loud but that is to be expected from a place that is so small. The sausage has was very good and I loved the latte. My girlfriend and I will definitely be back again!
5 star rating,"Service was excellent and the Brussel sprout salad was delicious! The food is made with love and care, which you taste in every bite."
5 star rating,Big fan! Great food.  The Brussels sprouts and cauliflower soup were a fav of mine! Great service.  Great! Great! This place is what new Detroit is all about!
4 star rating,"We stumbled across the Dime Store after running the Turkey Trot this morning - what a find!! The staff was exceptional! We (a large party of 7) were greeted warmly and had amazing service.  The pours in the drinks were extremely generous! Our whole table had Irish coffees & one bloody Mary.  It's not a traditional Irish coffee, it's about 3/4 whiskey 1/4 coffee - perfect after running the Turkey Trot!! We ordered breakfast which was served quite quickly (considering the Thanksgiving crowds.) Several people had omelets, one person had hash and one other had waffles.  All were fantastic. I would return in a heartbeat.   I find breakfast hard to do well, and they do it well.  Will return in a heartbeat!"
5 star rating,"Cannot say how great this food is. Waited 30 minutes on a Saturday morning - well worth it. Kids loved it too. My nine year old's face when the bacon apple waffles were put in front of him - PRICELESS!  The Korean french fries with bulgogi beef - wow... When you have guests in town, skip the greasy coney island breakfast and bring them to the DIME STORE!!!"
5 star rating,"Well-prepared food, great kitchen staff, quick service, and our server gave excellent recommendations.   Try the Philly Cheesesteak, it's amazing."
4 star rating,"Went here on Sunday for brunch and it was so yummy! I tried the salmon salad -- very good and light. The truffle fries were also really good. I would expect to wait awhile, but they do a great job managing how busy they get."
4 star rating,Love this place!!!  The atmosphere is nice.  Great place for a nice brunch!
4.5 star rating,Love love this place!! Delicious food and great ambiance. I enjoyed the experience and wish they were open for dinner
5 star rating,"It's a great place to grab brunch with friends. It's super small tho so it's inevitably a wait every time I go. 30 minutes +. I also found a hair in my food last time I went ....wait staff was great about it but it grossed me out. They didn't refund my meal, just brought a new one. Won't return here."
2 star rating,Had a great time with family. Arrived just before the Sunday morning crowd so we didn't have to wait. Of course we were there before 10. Had a veggie omelette that was terrific. Often omelette are dry and really overlooked. This one was perfect. Service was excellent. Busy place but server was attentive. The hash brown potatoes looked unusual but were good. Rye toast. Many interesting things on menu and will try next time.
5 star rating,"A bunch of friends and I went to get breakfast on a Sunday. I had gotten a recommendation from a local friend and we decided to check it out. The wait wasn't too bad, especially for our party of 8. I think we waited maybe 35 minutes. I liked the atmosphere of the place, especially the Ron Swanson quote on the wall. (""There has never been a sadness that can't be cured by breakfast food."") The wait for food wasn't bad at all, the only thing was my food seemed to have gotten lost. Everyone else in my party got their food at the same time and then I kept waiting... and waiting... and waiting for mine. I asked a couple different people about it, and then finally about 15 minutes after everyone had been eating, it came out. I got the sausage hash, which was pretty good. The homemade sausage could have had a little more flavor but I liked it. The avocado is a nice touch. My boyfriend got the cheesesteak benny, which was awesome. I would definitely order that if I ever went back. I wanted to try every single one of the sandwiches, too. They all sounded amazing!"
4 star rating,"My experience was an ok and the my reasons for saying that is because I was told it would be an hour wait ok cool no problem it became a problem when the hostess make up a lot of excuse to sit me, now I'm not sure if it's because I had a small child with or because she figured that I like waiting to eat whatever the issue was she cleared it when the manager came and got us a table right away. The food was ok I don't think I would be back just like the experience of eating at a place I've never ate at before."
3 star rating,"Fantastic food and even more fantastic service. Everyone is super energetic and friendly and the place is absolutely brimming with energy. I had the sausage omelette and it was thick and full of toppings which made it very filling. The sandwich choices were also good, korean BBQ sandwich being my favorite!"
5 star rating,I had lunch recently at Dime Store with a friend of mine and we were very pleased. We shared the spicy Korean fries which were excellent - I am a huge fan of bulgogi so incorporating that into a French fry was unique and very well executed. I then ended up ordering the Korean BBQ sandwich which was equally as well balanced and well executed. Dime Store sources locally and the quality certainly shows. This is a great spot and I am planning on trying their brunch soon. I will obviously be back!
4 star rating,"Not worth the wait. 2 hours of high expectations (one hr wait to be seated, 1 hour for food!) Lead to a lack luster omelette. Best thing on the plate was the sausage."
2 star rating,"I ordered Korean BBQ Sandwich, PBLT Sandwich, and Bangers/Mash. Bangers and Mash was their special,, a mix of lamb, pork, and livers sausage grilled with a side of mash potatoes drizzled with cherry cranberry reduction. I think the sausage was a bit tad dry, however others I came with enjoyed the meal very much. I guess the notion is to stick with the basics during the busy hours. We waited for almost 30 minutes on a Sunday morning, they get busy packed very early. I would recommend this place to anyone for breakfast/brunch place to visit in Detroit."
4 star rating,"Excellent service and amazing brunch options. Also, this historic building is a must stop on your tour of Detroit! My food was very tasty and very reasonably priced. The menu has many unique items that made me want to come back again for more! Loved the experience and would recommend!"
4.5 star rating,"Need to return to get a good review going, I enjoyed the bar tender and the vodka.....needles to say ....the food is a blur. I feel cheated I do not remember the food. Nice cozy place."
4 star rating,We went to this restaurant for brunch/lunch and everything was great. The restaurant has a very cool atmosphere  and food and service were excellent. I did not give a 5 star because the wait to get our food was a bit long.
4 star rating,I went to Dime Store with a few of my girlfriends in Detroit. I enjoyed the Korean BBQ sandwich with pickled carrots. The duk bop with eggs and hash was out of this world. The turkey sausage breakfast sandwich with a fresh salad was quite delicious.
4 star rating,El toro Benny was super yummy but did not completely blow me away. Also seems to get very busy. Before seating us they asked us to order and eat quickly which was a bit off putting.
4 star rating,Came here for Lunch a few months back. I ordered the chicken sandwich and minestrone soup. The peach compote on the sandwich was stronger than I expected. I would order in the side if I got it again.
4 star rating,"Wonderful brunch!!  Very popular place but very small so bring your patience and be nice to the hostess.  Funny to see how many people came in at peak, weekend brunch time and seemed surprised at how long the wait was!  Our large group was able to get seated within an hour and a half on a Saturday morning.  We got bananas foster waffles, omelettes, mimosas, oatmeal and everything was fantastic.  Be kind to the hostess!  I hope they open in a bigger location and take reservations at some point!"
5 star rating,Two of us went to brunch before a Detroit Lions game and they were very busy. We had to wait about 45 min but it was totally worth it! The food and service was amazing!
5 star rating,"Very reliable lunch / dinner spot with reasonably priced drinks. If you prefer healthier options or heavier ones, they have delicious things on their menu that will cover it. Great service too!"
4 star rating,"First time at the Dime Store. Only waited 10 minutes to get in. Great coffee, great Sevice and great Food... Highly recommend Dime Store. We will definitely go back...!!!"
5 star rating,I really enjoyed this place and the people in it. It was a great mix of demographics and buzzing the Saturday morning we went. At 9:30 a table for 6 had a half hour wait. When we left there were probably 30 people waiting for a table - and it is a small place. I am giving it a 4 because I didn't love the coffee - it was way too bitter for my taste and I enjoy strong coffee - I couldn't finish it. I had the Frenchman's Hash which was a special. Really original and fun. Come with an appetite and enjoy. The blueberry preserves for the English muffin was awesome as well!!
4.5 star rating,"Although my g/f orders the grilled cheese every visit, I'm halfway through the sandwich menu myself and I have nothing but great things to say about each one I've tried so far.  At this point, the Korean bbq is my favorite.  The breakfast is also just as great.  Sausage omelet is my favorite so far.  The homemade peach jam for the toast is awesome. Can't wait to enjoy happy hour here with a beer as I continue my journey through the rest of the sandwiches."
5 star rating,Unique & flavorful food. The Duck Reuben was very good. Service was a bit slow. Great location.
4 star rating,"Had the duck Reuben sandwich, delicious EXCEPT for the small bone I bit into. The cauliflower soup tasted frothy, not as good as I was expecting. My friend had the Pesto chicken salad, did not enjoy at all. The chicken was tuff, the salad was field greens out of a bag. Though the waiter was very friendly."
3 star rating,"I wish that I could give this place no stars. My friend and I stopped in to get a quick bite to eat and a nice cocktail. We decided to sit at the bar to speak directly with the bartender about some fun cocktails he could make us. Keep in mind we are two African-American females and the conversation was going very well. We spoke about our similar interests and new fun things to do. Unfortunately, he then became a bit TOO comfortable and began to use the N Word repeatedly. I understand that he was not using it ""towards"" us, but being a white male with dreads and hanging up with black people STILL does not allow you to use that word for any reason. We were immediately uncomfortable. How can a bartender think that is okay without even offering a disclaimer first? I'm not sure if he is still a bartender there, but I will not be returning to the otherwise beautiful establishment."
1 star rating,"Love the atmosphere. Got the bacon truffle fries- truly incredible. I also got the grilled chicken sandwich on a bed of greens rather than bread, and while I wasn't expecting to be blown away by a chicken salad (I was trying to be healthier after I downed those fries), it was pretty darn bland. There was no sauce (maybe they forgot it?) to pull it all together, so essentially it was just a plain chicken breast with cheese and onions on some spinach. It was perfectly edible but would not order that again. I'll come back and try something else. And those fries again."
4 star rating,"The dime store very trendy on the inside. Has a hipster feel. It took us over an hour to get in, even though there were empty tables. The food was mediocre. The service was sub par. The food sounded so good but the seasoning wasn't there. The food listed as spicy had no flavor or spice. My jerk chicken hash was just roasted chicken and pineapple. The coffee was terrible!!!! I repeat do not order coffee here. It tastes worst that hospital coffee that has been sitting out for hours. I'm glad I tried this place, but sad that it didn't live up to my expectations."
2 star rating,"Went here during happy hour on Friday. Got a seat right away. Our waitress was friendly, prompt & offered suggestions on beers. They have a nice variety. We tried the pork rinds, pork slider & truffle fries with bacon. All were really good. Apparently the sausage is homemade. The spices in it were really good. The order of pork rinds is huge & comes with a slightly spicy sauce drizzled over the top. Good snack. I think the fries could've used a little more truffle oil on the fries and/or in the dip. Overall, it was a good experience, the music was good and we'd come back again."
4 star rating,"Enjoyed our brunch a lot.  It's everything you might want... Busy, pleasantly noisy and fun!"
4 star rating,Meh!  Took 25 mins to get breakfast. Not even busy. Hash arrived. Cold stale potatoes. Been sitting for a while. Super bland. Not impressed.
3 star rating,great food and ambiance! the fries were amazing and so was the salmon burger. there's a parking garage right around the corner and the restaurant is conveniently located near campus martius. the brussel sprout appetizer was alright just not crispy enough. the restaurant was a bit too loud for my parents but overall it's a great place to grab a bite.
4.5 star rating,"We discovered this fun brunch spot when we spent the weekend downtown for a hockey game. The couple we were with was ready to move on due to the wait, I'm so glad we didn't! We sat at the counter and ordered four Beermosas. Why haven't we thought of this before? Beer for breakfast? Brilliant! (We now make these at home, having found that Dime Store had the perfect recipe with good juice and Atwater Dirty Blonde beer.) We enjoyed conversation with the bartender and what turned out to be an amazing brunch. He recommended we order anything featuring the sausage because it is house made. We heeded this advice and were very pleased; both the sausage hash and the sausage omelette are worth return trips to this downtown brunch destination!"
5 star rating,"Nice. That's how I feel after the Korean BBQ sandwich. It was succulent, it was sweet, it was a surprise that makes me feel good. And perhaps the best part is I feel full. Not overfull. Not hungry. But full. I ate all of it including add on fries and I feel good. Good."
5 star rating,"Korean BBQ sandwich was awesome.   Omelet a were awesome.  Everything here is awesome.   This is a must stop place, hipster or not"
5 star rating,"We were referred here by American Coney Island, since they don't serve breakfast.  It's saying a lot that a competitor referred us here. Exceptional food!  The sausage is made in house, and the bread is fresh and moist. My party and I all had omelettes, and these were fantastic.The 80s music they play is phenomenal.  Great mix from my favorite era. One star off for bad coffee and horrible service from our server. The owner, Jeff, stepped in and did a great job compensating for her. I only found out he was the owner when I went to give him my server's tip (since he did ALL her work). He spent a long time talking with us, which is great. I highly recommend it."
4 star rating,"TL;DR The wait for brunch is worth it.  And it's not an uncomfortable wait either.  Located inside the Chrysler House building, the columned atrium has tables, chairs, and plenty of floor space to relax while waiting for a table.  I only wish that cocktails or a more available coffee service was an option to fill the time before seating opened up.Service was quick after seated and the staff were knowledgeable of the dishes and drinks.  Neither overly friendly or too hip to smile, the hostess and bartenders were excellent.I had the duck bop, a confit duck hash with eggs and English muffin.  It was tasty, seasoned well with a sweet sauce.  To drink I had a bloody mary, which was simple, served without a garnish, using local brand Tito's vodka.  The service was prompt.  If I could give any criticism of the food, looking around, many dishes seem to lean too heavily into sriracha sauce and that I like a nice garnish with my bloody mary, nothing too fancy, a pickle or some giardiniera.Prices were reasonable for good food. $12 bucks for a fairly big breakfast cooked well.  Like I said earlier, for an $8 bloody mary I was hoping for a bit more than mix and vodka.  Overall, give it a go.  It's great to see some more options open up downtown, and I'm planning on making this a regular spot to grab a bite to eat."
5 star rating,Big Mike was awesome and his signature Jameson drink was really good. The food and the overall experience was fantastic!!!
4 star rating,"Came to this spot for brunch. Very friendly and attentive staff, the manager performed a table touch. I had no issues in my experience and if I lived here I would eat here often."
5 star rating,Great food. Good service. Refreshing addition to the downtown lunch spots.
5 star rating,"From the start of sipping my first latte here, I was ready to love The Dime Store. Lovely location and excellent creative menu that captivated both my boyfriend and I. As other reviewers have noted, a wait can be expected on weekends and holidays. We tried the truffle/parm/bacon fries, Mac and cheese, eggs, turkey sausage, pork belly blt sandwich. Everything came out hot, delicious, and wanting more. Waitress who was helping us was pleasant and attentive. So why the three star review? Customer service. We witnessed a couple next to us receive pretty lousy treatment over an issue with the food. I am a frequent diner of all the new exciting places in Detroit, and customer service is SO important. It was uncomfortable watching the situation play out and it seemed like there could have been a more simple way of handling it all. FYI, customer stated that her meat seemed undercooked and the waitress was not only disagreeing with the diner, but took a while to offer the ""can we make you a new plate""? resolution. As a bystander, the entire situation seemed silly. It could have been addressed more efficiently without losing customers. C'mon guys- I want to love you, but this is so basic!"
3 star rating,"Well, it seems that everyone in this place is on amateur hour. Not too sure if the employees knew how to handle a busy Saturday brunch. Let's start with the host, he was the most unfriendly greeter I have ever met upon walking into a restaurant. When he would come out into the lobby you couldn't even hear him call your name. Second, we waited about 10 mins for a server to greet us and another 5 mins for drinks, the poor girl was struggling and getting triple sat and NOBODY was reaching out to help her. Another server came up to us to apologize that we were not in her section and that she would find our server. Ummmm, no? You can greet us and grab the drink order if you have enough time to go find the poor girl. Incredible, management needs to step in at times like that and notice when there are too long of guest wait times for DRINKS especially. However, the food came out promptly. My omelette was a solid cheesy goodness omelette but my potatoes and toast were cold and chewy as hell. Lame. After that, nobody came to check on us and meanwhile the table next to us was dealing with their burnt French toast and the server was handling it in the worst possible way. But, that wasn't my circus so whatever. The place looks cool, but make sure the rest of your staff follows along with your cool guidelines too. Otherwise, you all look like a buncha' rookies. Avoid this place unless it's on a Wednesday at like 2:30, maybe you won't get poor service and food then."
4.5 star rating,Delicious food but can get crowded so make sure that you go early if you do not want to wait. They do not accept reservations and will not seat you until your entire party has arrived. The restaurant is also very small/tight inside.
5 star rating,"Service was good. However, for the price the serving was small compared to other places. We parked on the street (meter) and walked around the corner. The place is inside the old Chrysler building. The food was decent."
3 star rating,Very tasty food. The fries with the duck were amazing and they had good drink specials. Only issue is parking .
4 star rating,A group of us from work went here for lunch.  Even before we left the office we were having a hard time narrowing our menu choices down.  All of us ended up getting the Korean BBQ sandwich which was excellent.  The only downfall with this place is that the wait staff moves very slow!  There doesn't seem to be any urgency on how fast they deliver drinks or food.  I'd recommended this place if you have over an hour to devote to lunch.
4 star rating,"This is one situation where i'm going to have to disagree with Yelp...I came with high expectations because the reviews were so good, but definitely left a little disappointed. There was a little bit of a wait to be seated (15 min) which I expected but the seating was reAlly crowded. I dont like being able to bump elbows with the stranger next to me while i'm eating. My pork sausage was actually raw inside and the manager said  that sometimes it can be a little pink...it was RAW. I'm pretty sure that you can get really really sick from eating raw pork, so that was weird. They did bring me some more out which was still still slightly pink...I ate it anyway. Hopefully i'll be ok. It tasted really good. The french toast was pretty good....this might be miner to some ppl but the butter was cold and impossible to spread. The scrambled eggs were definitely better than average. Service was.....ok. All in all its an ok place that I probably wont come back to because there are better choices."
3 star rating,Great ambiance and yummy food.  I had a burger and pork skins. Holy cow I'm not a fan of pork skins but these were really fabulous.  Lovely local beers and friendly servers. I'll be back!
4 star rating,"great brunch!went a couple months ago...crazy long wait, hostess did not provide good communication"
4 star rating,Usually crowded during lunch hour on weekday but food is good overall. One star knocked for service since I think it can be improved. Not bad but noticed that service is usually slower than the norm.
4 star rating,Never disappointed here to bad they got rid of hamms beer and shot of Jamison's $6 special
4 star rating,"The only reason I am giving 4 and not 5 stars is because they have a few kinks to work through as a new establishment.  the food was amazing, prices very good. they do still need their liquor license, and the staff needs time to learn the new POS system which is all on tablet, it slowed our server down significantly.  Everyone was very helpful and friendly though. We will ABSOLUTELY be back. The food was so good, I could have eaten the cauliflower and gruyere soup all day long and insisted others with us try it. I'm sure in no time, this place will be a well oiled machine."
4.5 star rating,"My wife and I stopped in for lunch after reading a few reviews and checking out the menu online and I wouldn't say we were disappointed but we weren't overly impressed either.  It's a cool little spot, due to how busy they were and the size of the place we knew that it might take a little longer to get our food but for what we ordered the wait time and the service were definitely disappointing.  There were two other tables (that we noticed) who were seated before us that still hadn't received their food by the time we finished ours, so it seems like a consistent issue for their kitchen.The food was good but nothing spectacular.  My wife ordered the chicken salad sandwich and I ordered the Korean bbq sandwich with the pickled vegetables and we both ordered mac n' cheese for a side.  The Korean bbq was definitely on the sweet side and they didn't really put any of the vegetables on it to cut through it, the chicken salad was ok and the mac n'cheese was good but not great. For the most part it wouldn't be anything that most people couldn't make at home with similar ingredients. Overall, for the price you could find some better options with higher quality food.  It's a place where if you happen to be in the area it wouldn't be a bad place to stop and grab something to eat but definitely not a place to make a special trip for."
3 star rating,Great breakfast location downtown. The environment is lively and fun. The staff was fun and fast. The food was great and the coffee was amazing.! I would eat here every morning.
5 star rating,"We were heading for a day trip to Detroit and figured we would have a bite to eat. Picked this place because of it's proximity to the border, and its high yelp reviews. We were freaking hungry!We came on a Saturday morning, so the place was jam packed. We had to wait for almost an hour to get a seat, which is okay. There were so many peeps there and the place was bustlin so we didn't mind. Once we got seated we ordered right away, since the menu was outside and we picked our food since we got bored! Then the annoying part came, where we has to wait like 30-40 mins for our food. Seriously? We ordered eggs and a salad! I also added a side of potatoes and they gave them to me on a cold plate... Which was weird. I gave it back and requested it be added to my main dish (isnt that supposed to be self explanatory?) nevertheless, my boyfriend says i whine too much, but the food was pretty underwhelming considering the wait time, the price and the actual food. Nothing wow, and at that point of hunger- wowing us should be easy. You should go and check it out if ur in the area, bc of the atmosphere and the cool interior, but its definitely not somewhere i would frequent more than once. On the plus side, the building its in is very old Detroit deco and the bathrooms are modern and spotless !"
3 star rating,"This place is already good, and I'm excited to see what it's like when the liquor license finally goes through. They offer breakfast and lunch, with a good variety of choices despite a relatively small menu. The duck reuben sandwich is absolutely fantastic!The areas of improvement are: 1. The service was pretty slow at lunch time, although I suspect this has alot to do with being brand new, and 2. the prices are a bit steep for the amount of food, although it is very high quality. I imagine the service will improve, the prices seem permanent. All in all, I will definitely be heading back."
4 star rating,"Parking validation was a lie. We were told over the phone they would validate the entire parking fee when in reality they only validate half of it, and we were left with a $10 parking fee. The food was also mediocre."
1 star rating,Breakfast and brunch to die for. Such a cozy and amazing restaurant. Had cereal French toast and eggs all were exceptional! Highly recommend!
5 star rating,"This is a must when in downtown Detroit, very impressed with the menu, quality of the food and excellent service.  There is typically a wait, so go early or late.  The number of seats are minimal but well worth the wait.  They text when your table is ready, so you can take a walk or run a quick errand.  The proportions are large, go hungry!  I started with a peach mimosa...yum!"
5 star rating,Relaxed atmosphere but serious food. I had the house soup and duck hash. They were both excellent
5 star rating,"Cool atmosphere.  Food was good.  But the experience was a total cluster-f.  We went there for breakfast/brunch.  It took over an hour for our food to arrive.  If you have seen the pictures, you know this place does not seat that many people, so I have no idea why the wait was so long... oh wait, I do.  The waitress admitted to forgetting to put in our order.  The manager did make it right by us.  And again, the food was decent."
3 star rating,One of the best dining experiences we have had for brunch.  A great authentic Detroit vibe.  All of the staff are friendly and energetic.  SUCH a GREAT VIBE here!!!  We were in Detroit for 2 days and came back the second day because the menu is so interesting there was so much we wanted to try.  I am so excited to go back again someday soon. Will recommend to everyone.  Great job guys!!! LOVE this place.
4.5 star rating,"What a find! After days of eating awful catered meals at the RenCen Marriott, Dime Store really hit the spot. So many sandwiches on the lunch menu sounded delicious that I had a hard time choosing. I eventually went with the Korean BBQ and it was the right choice. Whenever I'm back in downtown Detroit I'll be back to try the rest of the menu. The duck Ruben and PBLT (pork belly, lettuce, tomato) are calling my name. Great little place."
5 star rating,"Reasonably priced, excellent food, attentive waitstaff and neat atmosphere- pretty much sums up this place. Only has breakfast and lunch all day (no big dinner entrees) but it is all delicious! Location is good- walking distance to campus martius. I'll definitely be going back."
5 star rating,"If you want a nice breakfast come to this little hidden gem in the Chrysler building!The energy is great, lunch is decently sized but the eggs Benedict is where it is at (and the fact they serve soup in a coffee cup is pretty cool too) The only reason I couldn't give it a 5 is because it's a hit or miss with the wait staff and the length of time to get food"
4 star rating,Amazing food. Service is great and happy. And Jeffery one of the owners was so pleasant to talk to. I have gone back 3 times in the past 2 weeks. Must have *HASH*
5 star rating,"Ok. First off I love that downtown Detroit is making a comeback and we have had a few spectacular meals this weekend on our visit, and this place was great EXCEPT some of the other patrons were either screaming babies or rude (no manners) and it almost ruined our dining experience. The food was great as well as decor and service but half the restaurant was just so classless and manner less we almost left. Just want to give you honest feedback. I probably won't return for this reason. I rated it 4 stars for the food and service ONLY."
4 star rating,"Yesterday was my first time here and loved it! They serve breakfast all day.I ordered the egg and smoked salmon sandwich... It was so good!! Coffee was also good.The place was crowded so we had to wait about 20 min for a table. Then once seated our food took also about 25 min to come in; they did apologize for the wait and applied a 50 percent off from our bill which we did not take but added as a tip. The food was worth the wait and we were in no rush, plus the ambience was nice and the waiters and hostess were taking good care of us; so we were overall happy about our meal experience. We will come back!"
5 star rating,"Good food, great setup, but they have a very rude hostess who is either too inexperienced or too lazy to handle busy mornings."
3 star rating,"Cute space, friendly wait staff but the food was just too oily. We each had an omelette that felt like it was just overly stuffed with bacon and cheese. The potatoes weren't quite seasoned well enough for me and the toast had a strange taste to it. I'd probably skip it."
3 star rating,"I went here twice this weekend for breakfast and the food was great both times (especially the house-made sausage in the omelet)! I actually almost did not go back because the bartender the first time during brunch was terrible. He was a bigger guy with a beard...way too cool for school and really rude. He seems like he should work at a hipster dive bar where he can think he's way cooler than he actually is. High-five, bro.Thankfully, I decided to give it a second try on Tuesday, 5/5. I met a good friend of the owners (who was managing) and he was super nice. He saw that I was there a few minutes before they opened and let me hang out while the kitchen opened up. He was talkative and apologetic for the super cool bartender. Overall, I would absolutely recommend Dime Store to anyone looking for excellent food in the area; the ambiance is awesome, the prices are excellent, etc."
4 star rating,"How has it taken me so long to discover this great restaurant within walking distance of work?  No matter, I know of it now.Boasting an modern, industrial vibe and a full bar, and serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner, The Dime Store is a trendy, trending place where you'll find an interesting mix of business people, hipsters, and tourists.  The co-worker who introduced me to this nearby treasure has been there multiple times, each time trying something new and ""never"" getting anything that wasn't good.  On this visit, he chose the chicken salad sandwich, which he described as ""out of the ordinary"" and ""good"".I opted for the PBLT and the spicy korean fries, each of which could have stood on its own as a lunch.  The PBLT was porkbelly, lettuce, and tomato, served with mayonnaise on a hearty, toasted and buttered, white bread.  Yum!  The spicy korean fries were topped with korean bbq beef and smothered in sriracha may.  Double Yum!The third person in our party opted for breakfast for lunch and got the daily special - two eggs any style (he chose over medium) with sausage and toast.  Both the eggs and sausage were underdone for his taste; he didn't eat the sausage, but he said the eggs (over easy) were good and the toast was wonderful.  Had it been me, I would have sent the sausage back for more cooking...We walked over from work for lunch, and an early lunch at that, so drinks weren't on our menu this time.  The Dime Store does have a happy hour, which I am certainly going to try out soon.  Yay!  Another great choice in downtown Detroit."
4.5 star rating,The wait was long but worth it - we wanted coffee while we waited the hostess recommended Starbucks 1 block away - no biggie. Once seated - although crowded the service was great- fast - friendly ... I'm so glad my husband wanted to find a place downtown for breakfast after a wedding at the MGM - suburbanites Detroit is great!
5 star rating,I have a great experience every time I come here and been here a few times! It was much better than Parks and Rec. The seating has long lines but it's comfortable and worth the wait in my opinion. The food is really good and so is the service. Would recommend for sure!
5 star rating,The most clever little diner ever! Vintage schoolhouse tables and chairs complete the incredible design aesthetic! A must see even if you just pop in for a to go coffee. In the Dime building- worth seeing itself!
5 star rating,"Not impressed. Services were slow and inaccurate. Food sat under heat lamp for 5 minutes while cook continued to ring bell for ""ORDER UP"". The saving grace would be they deducted the charge for one of the items because it was prepared improperly. Better luck next time."
3 star rating,"I ate breakfast at the Dime Store on a Sunday morning 8/6/17.  Let me start off by saying the reason I give four stars and not five because we had to wait a little over a hour and they don't take reservations.  It is a very small restaurant.  So we walked in about 11 a.m. on a Sunday.  I guess that was prime time because it was over 50 people waiting for a table.  I started to leave but I decided to stay and wait due to the good reviews that I read on here.  I'm glad I did wait because I was not disappointed.  I ordered French toast with fruit it was delicious.  I also ordered a side of turkey sausage. Turkey sausage at restaurants I go to is usually very dry, but this turkey sausage was just right, very moist and had very different taste.  Once you are seated and your order is taken your not waiting a long time for your food.  Don't let the wait scare you.  Just go on a day that you are not rushing."
4 star rating,"Seriously. I worked in this building before Dime Store, BonBonBon, & Drought moved in and my heart breaks at the missed deliciousness!!!! Either way I absolutely loved my experience at Dime Store. I went into it not expecting it to stand out from the other great Detroit eateries I've tried but the food was truly STAND OUT! Chicken Tortilla Soup in a coffee mug and yes I did sip it like it was afternoon tea til every last drop was gone - it was by far the best CT soup I've tried!! The Veggie burger was sooooo good and filling. It was a unique blend of barley and some other stuff that really didn't leave me missing meat at all. French fries are good too! I can't wait to go back- it will be hard to try something new that meal was so good but I can't wait to see how everything else is! Service was super nice and friendly, a little slow on water refills but they were really kind and accommodating! Well done, Dime Store!"
4 star rating,"I dont understand what the hype is all about! Me and my husband were their yesterday for brunch for the first time. Their was no wait so we got seated right away. Unfortunately we were sitting their for almost 15 min  until we flagged a waiter down that kept passing us by to go serve a different table and avoided us like the plague. My husband proceeded to ask if we were going to be waited on sometime today and the waiter said ""what can i get you"" instead of im sorry for the wait etc etc. It was like we were invisible or our money was not good enough for them. Never ever have i been to a restaurant and got mistreated like that. We were litterally sitting on a small table in the center visible to all the staff members especially in a small place like that how can someone miss you! Staff was rude food was very very average. And i asked for tortilla soup with my meal and the waiter asked for both of you i said no just myself and i never got it and i never asked why. I also found a hair in my food but i was so annoyed of waiting for everything that i didnt care to let them know because nobody cared to come ask how we were doing! Never ever going back their again! And for my family and friends that recommended we try it out on their behalf i will let them know not to."
1 star rating,"One of best breakfast places in metro Detroit. Rivals Fly Trap in Ferndale. Omelette was insanely good. Coffee excellent from Zingermans. A little pricey, $30 breakfast for 2 but worth it. Expect 20-30min wait if you go weekends between 10-12pm. Will be back soon. 5 stars no question."
5 star rating,"The food is decent, and the service is good.  It's a bit too hipster for my liking, but not bad non-the-less.  The coffee, on the other hand, is absolutely horrendous.  Super sour and completely undrinkable.Response to Ann-Marie's reply:  Hipsters always deny they are hipsters.  It's one of the many things that people despise about them.If your coffee is known to be 'polarizing' as you put it, you might want to offer an alternate blend - as a smart business owner would do.  I lived for seven years in Colombia, and serving coffee like yours would get somebody killed - quite literally.Hipsters always claim to enjoy horrible tasting foods, because they think it makes them special and cool.  Overly sour coffee, along with overly bitter IPA beers are the hallmark of the hipster crowd.  No.  It doesn't make you cool.  It just demonstrates you have low self esteem and poor taste."
3 star rating,Korean fries were great! so was the french toast. If you come with 2 people getting a table shouldn't be difficult.
4.5 star rating,"Wow, what a find!Terrific place.  Great service, great food, great value!Came in on a weekday lunch, and the place was packed and hopping.  Regardless, the hostess and the wait staff were all very accommodating, and always smiling.We had the duck rueben, poached pear salad, and the gruyere cauliflower soup.    ALL are highly recommended!Definitely a spot I'd recommend to to others!"
5 star rating,"Ordered a sandwich and misunderstood the wait time involved. They were particularly busy this morning and I had to run off to a meeting before picking up my food. When I went back, the staff was incredibly helpful. The manager was kind, and offered me a complimentary drink while I waited. The cook/expeditor came out and personally handed me the food and apologized. We both knew it was more my fault than his, but he was still extremely gracious. The sandwich was delicious. I went to Dime Store because of recommendations of friends, and they met the reputation that they've carved out for themselves as a business. High, high praise goes to the employees. They, along with the delicious food, won over a new customer."
5 star rating,"I had the sausage hash, which was a delicious blend of fresh flavors. Many of the menu items piqued my interest, and I can't wait to go back and try more.Service was quick, helpful and polite. Definitely a go-to spot for brunch and more in downtown Detroit."
4 star rating,"I had been wanting to try this place for a while and finally had the chance to have lunch there last week.It definitely lived up to the anticipation! Great vibe and the place was packed!I had the veggie burger and loved it. I can't recall what kind of sandwich my friend had, but she loved it too!I will definitely be going back!"
5 star rating,"Fun ""diner"" with a nice vibe that is freaking impossible to get into at night.  Literally.  There was not an unlocked door to the building, and when we rang security, they just kept saying ""security"" and didn't hear that we kept asking to be let in so we could go to the restaurants.  Finally a lady came out and we quickly grabbed the door and scuttled in.  The place was nearly empty on Tuesday night (maybe because other people didn't try so hard to get in?)Once we made it in, things got better.  We ordered a few sides to share and each got an entree.  Items ordered were the mac & cheese, spicy korean fries, pork burger,  brussels sprouts, duck bop hash, and pblt.  I didn't try either of the latter three but did sample the first three.  My coworkers liked the hash and the pblt.  It was said though that the english muffin and the jam were wasted on the duck bop hash because the korean sauce overpowered the jam.  My pork burger was pretty good and an interesting flavor combination.  The mac & cheese was good, though I think it needed a touch of a slightly sharper cheese to make it really stand out.  I enjoyed the Korean fries but would have preferred more Sriracha mayo and beef and less of the BBQ marinade in the bottom.I will admit that I think I would have been even happier with our meal if I hadn't just eaten at Wright & Co the day before which featured some very similar items (pork belly sliders, brussells sprouts salad, pasta w/ gorgonzola etc.) and was just beyond the bell curve amazing so very hard to live up to.  Regardless, Dime Store is a great restaurant that's definitely worth a visit."
4 star rating,"Perfect place for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. Menu consists of the standard waffles, french toast and omelets but also unique twists like cheesesteak bennys and duck hash. The veggie hash with eggs over easy on top was delicious! The staff was exceptionally friendly and coffee(Zingermans) brewed to perfection.There is also a lunch menu and a full bar. I will definitely return !"
5 star rating,"Business lunch, first time there. Got in at 1130am to beat the rush and was super glad I did! Great food...I had the duck reuben...and even better service...Lauren is awesome...warm and engaging. Though I'm from chicago, I can't wait to try Dime Store for breakfast."
5 star rating,Great staff. Friendly & attentive. Wide enough menu with their own take on the items. And having breakfast available all the time is a great touch. Comfortable even though there is a lot going on around you. I have been here several times now and it has made it to my list of regular rotation that I would gladly recommend to friends. Yum.
5 star rating,"5 stars ++Love this for a breakfast spot!Let me start from the beginning.  Some people may be discouraged to dine here if they are not familiar with the city and/or parking. But the great thing is the location is easy to get to and there is street parking all around.  And a tip to remember, you do not have to pay the meters on Sunday. (Fort street is full of street parking.)The restaurant is located in the Chrysler Building where the old Rio Wraps use to be. It is relatively small inside, but they do a good job of not having the tables on top of one another.They have a great breakfast menu which includes mimosas and bloody marys.  The bloody mary is tasty topped with a pickle and lime. They use a mix, but I didn't recognize the bottle. If you like home fries 100% hands down choose the hash. So So So So good!! Everyone I dined with chose a hash dish. I went with the veggie and the others had cornedbeef hash and a sausage hash. We all cleaned our plate! The portions are very generous.The service was great even for them being busy with a wait. Our server was great and super personable. Although I can not speak on their lunch menu I know if it is anything like breakfast then it is a must stop."
5 star rating,"It says something about a place when you stop in for breakfast and drag a friend back the same day for a late lunch.  OK, in fairness, it could say that there are limited options in your area but that's not the case at all here!  Breakfast was a BLTE (bacon, lettuce, tomato and egg - with spicy mayo) and an Americano to go.  They were jumpin' at 10:30 when I went; but my coffee was made immediately and the wait wasn't long at all for the sandwich.It felt long - but only because I kept watching all of the food I *didn't* get coming out to other diners.  Everything look as good as (or better than) the pictures on the website and I wanted it all.My sandwich was fantastic.  Eggs are simple things, deceptively so.  Anyone can cook an egg.  But it takes real skill to perfectly cook one.  And this was.  The white was well set but the yolk was still gooey and velvety but not so much that any of it ran out of the sandwich.The only thing that I would say is that the mayo could have been a little spicier.  But that's really a minor ding.  It was truly excellent.Fast forward a couple of hours and a friend texts me that he's starving.  Hey that's as good an excuse as any!  They were still pretty full at 2:45 but we got right in, got a table and ordered a mimosa and a beermosa.  We decided to start with the pork rinds.Everything else could be terrible (but it's not!) and I would STILL come back here for those pork rinds.  Amazing!  Crunchy and fresh and with that Korean sauce on them?  That sauce went astonishingly well with the rinds.  The serving is huge for the price, too.After we polished those off, we got our bennys.  Philly Cheesesteak for my friend and Pork Belly for me.  And again, perfect cooked eggs - all four of them.  We did find it lacked salt but decided that that was less that the benedicts needed salt and more that we'd just eaten that huge thing of salty/spicy pork rinds.  Next time we'll reverse that order and I'm sure all will be well.The staff were great - working like crazy but still managed to be extremely friendly and attentive and looking more laid-back than harried.And the prices were really reasonable for what you get.We're already planning on when we're going to bring our co-workers for lunch.  And then possibly after work for more pork rinds and beers.  Maybe even on the same day!It's that kind of place."
4.5 star rating,Salad was just ok but looking forward to trying other menu items maybe they will be better
3 star rating,"Great place in the Dime Bank Building, now called Chrysler House. A Detroit miracle occurred when I found an open parking spot right in front of the restaurant. A second miracle occurred when the meter was broken and I didn't have to pay! Already a great day and I haven't even had lunch yet.Arrived at about 12:30 pm one day last week and wasn't sure if that was bad timing with the lunch crowd. Many people there, but not full and was able to be seated immediately. I had the duck reuben. Huge sandwich. Took half of it home. Very good, but only mildly resembling a reuben. My daughter had macaroni and cheese with bacon. Another huge portion that she ate for two more days. We shared an appetizer of pork rinds. My daughter, who hates to eat anything that sounds too much like the animal it once was, was brave and tried one. We both loved them and said we'd like to come back and just have those with a couple beers. (Yes, I'm old and my daughter is legal.) The tables are cozy, too cozy for me. (See previous paragraph where it says I'm old.) When we were seated it seemed like we were just at one end of another group's table. We were literally elbow to elbow. Fortunately, they were finishing and soon left. The food was great. The service was great. I will definitely go back. If I wasn't seated touching elbows with people I don't know, I'd go all five stars."
4 star rating,"Wow ... I not a fan of thinking a restaurant which is only a couple years old could be that good but this one has it going on! The employees were superstars and the food outstanding. My wife had a mimosa and said it was the best she ever drank. The bacon truffle fries were something like I have never had before and we have eaten in almost every major area of the country. The prices were great, especially for the quality of food. The only negative might be the wait as the lines are long but they have a nice lounge area where you can wait and the time seemed to go quickly."
5 star rating,"DISCLAIMER: We had lunch. I heard this place has an excellent brunch but the lunch is just meh. I had a beef burger with bacon and cheese, my girlfriend had a pork burger, and my sister had a chicken burger. All three were just ok. It was nothing spectacular. The flavors were mute and nothing about it screamed quality. I would go back to try to the brunch, but I probably won't be going back here for lunch again. Sidenote: it was undeservedly too expensive. I would have rather spent the $40 on sushi than on 3 burgers and no drinks."
3 star rating,"This place is amazing, the hashes are great. I took a group of friends to brunch here over the July 4th weekend and even though it was busy, we were sat within 20 mins. Love the décor."
5 star rating,Big Mike was awesome and his signature Jameson drink was really good. The food and the overall experience was fantastic!!!
4 star rating,"This place is just okay. Like other reviewers, I was excited to try this place because I've heard nothing but great things. I was underwhelmed. The food was just average. Another overhyped restaurant. I gave this place two chances and I was underwhelmed both times."
3 star rating,"I had heard great things about this place so I had high hopes. I ordered the classic eggs benedict with pork belly. My eggs were full of shells I couldn't enjoy it. The only thing that was exceptional was the parmesan fries and mimosa. Service was great. I would've asked for another plate, but was on a time limit. Too bad they didn't get it right the first time."
3 star rating,"Good food but really busy for brunch, and especially on weekends. Our server this most recent time was Tamika and she was super nice, so I hope she becomes a Yelp superstar. I pretty much always get either the veggie omelette or the veggie hash, but stealing food from my friends' plates I can say I've never had anything I didn't like from here. Huge bloody marys that aren't 50% crappy vodka, good local beer."
4 star rating,very cool place. the eggs Benny was awesome. if i had to deduct it would be from myself as i was sitting at the bar and knocked over like 15 glasses. they were very nice i felt horrible.
4.5 star rating,Love this place sometimes it's a long wait but totally worth it! The salmon Benedict is amazing
5 star rating,"I was excited to try the Dime Store a couple months ago.  I've been there a few times in the last few months.  It has typically been quiet when I have gone there, but I haven't been for breakfast, so I can't speak to that time of day.The Dime Store is situated in the Chrysler House (formerly known as the Dime Building).  It is in the front off of Griswold and offers large window views of the street.  The kitchen is open and provides you the opportunity to watch your food being prepared.I was a little disappointed by some of the staff who I found rude and made me feel unwelcome.  My second visit I encountered the same rude behavior and some offensive commentary.I'm not sure if I will be back anytime soon, but with a change in the attitude of some of the employees to be a bit more professional this could be a nice fixture in Detroit."
2 star rating,"Antonio recommended dishes and he was right on the money!  The wait was 1 hour for three of us to get a table.  Probably about 50-55 people were waiting for tables.  AND IT WAS WORTH WAITING FOR!!!!  I got the Benny and it was the Best I have ever had anywhere.  I am extremely picky but this food sent shivers up and down my backbone.  Our Waiter Antonio was thorough, quick, friendly, and I tipped him handsomely for making this the BEST eating experience in Detroit!!!  We will be back and a lot.  I will wait 2 hours to get this experience again."
5 star rating,"This place has horrible service! The waiter forgot about us, the hostess had to remind him we were at the table. He gave us our water and left quick even though we were ready to order. We watched one of the fools wipe his sweaty face, walked over to someone else and taped them on the back and went back to making food without washing his hands! They also forgot the poached eggs on my dish! That's one of the main components. The food  was very good though!"
3 star rating,"found bacon in my food in a dish ordered without any meat, cheese or egg products. didn't seem very apologetic and nothing taken off the bill. the food was also very over cooked. i won't be back, there are also plenty of places in detroit with the same menu.."
3 star rating,"We loved the Dime Store!  Our omelettes were amazing ... really delicious.  The hash browns were just ok.  They had a strange seasoning on them.  They were also cubed instead of shredded & browned.  The toast was not toasted very well, but the jelly was good.  The place is very cool inside."
4 star rating,"Sunday brunch here is everything.  We went at about 1:00 and they had a sizeable crowd.  The wait time was maybe 20 minutes.  My omelette was amazing.  The fruit bowl was a sizeable bowl of fresh, beautiful fruit with a lot of variety:  apples, oranges, raspberries....it was perfect.  I was also served a VERY Large Mimosa.  It wasn't very strong, but definitely tasty.  I highly recommend this place."
5 star rating,The food was typical and fair if a bit over priced. The staff was not great or professional.
2 star rating,"Very popular place, and I definitely saw why. Great food and great service. Even if you have to wait for a table, the art deco lobby is beautiful and comfortable. It's a trendy place with an upbeat vibe. I plan on going back the next time I am in Detroit."
5 star rating,"Time and again I enjoy eating here. Mike Torres, the bartender is always super friendly to me. I always get the pork Benny with a coffee. It is my confirmed hangover cure."
4.5 star rating,"Came back on the 31st waited an hour to be seated but well worth it, I love this place. My son wasn't to thrilled being charged $5 for a cup of OJ that came straight out of a jug of Florida's Best that cost $3.19 a half gallon at the market."
5 star rating,What a gem in downtown Detroit. I can recommend all of the hash dishes perfectly cooked fried eggs I only wish they did poached. One small complaint was that my daughter in law thought the cauliflower gruyere soup could have used more cheese. Compliment your selves on a well trained staff.We will be back especially since my son lives 2 blocks away.
5 star rating,"Will definitely be back.  Love the decor, seats look like they are from old school desks, has a fun urban vibe.  Food was terrific, while it was lunch time mid week, they offered some great breakfast options.  Bacon waffles were great, feel like the portions are generous."
4 star rating,"Cute space, friendly wait staff but the food was just too oily. We each had an omelette that felt like it was just overly stuffed with bacon and cheese. The potatoes weren't quite seasoned well enough for me and the toast had a strange taste to it. I'd probably skip it."
3 star rating,"Very overrated. We went after reading it was rated one of the top bunch spots in Detroit. Once we got there, we were told it was going to be a 45 min to hour wait and decided to wait since it was supposedly the best brunch in town. We ended up waiting hour and a half then sat down to order bloody mary's that were $9 and mediocre in flavor then both ordered the homemade sausage hash which came out on a somewhat small portioned plate. It had too much sirracha which overwhelmed the flavors and only a little bit. For the money, it was not worth it. The service was good and fast once we were seated and the food wasn't bad. We were just expecting more and were very underwhelmed. Wouldn't recommend the hassle or time."
3 star rating,"Just finishing our meal at Dime Store--started with Cauliflower soup--outstanding! Side of Brussel Sprouts--delicious. Frenchmans Hash was a delight for the eyes and the stomach--beets, potatoes, squash,roasted beef with siracha sauce that was very flavorful without being too spicy. Came with English muffin with very tasty apricot jam. Highly recommend."
4 star rating,"Wow!!!!!!!!! The food was outstanding! Our bartender/server was everything we could have hoped for, being two kids from Ohio trekking into enemy territory. Big Mike was big, bearded and so incredibly fun. Our experience matched the taste of the food. This will be our favorite place to eat IF we step foot in -ichigan again!!! Well done Dime Store, well done!!"
5 star rating,Went here because I heard it was so good.  The staff the food was great!  BUT getting seated was a nightmare.  I suggest that if your party is over 4 people go somewhere else.  We had to wait  an hour and a half for seating because our party was so large.  We had an 80 year old and a four year old.  Both very impatient.  By the time we got seated everyone was so stressed we really didn't enjoy ourselves. But have to emphasize the wait staff and food were excellent it go elsewhere if more than 4 people!
3 star rating,"Don't get me wrong, the food is great. But Big Mike slapped my bill down in front of me because he was so busy talking to the people next to me.  It would have been nice to be acknowledged and asked how my meal was. It was good by the way."
3 star rating,"What a wonderful surprise.  You know it's gonna be good when you really struggle to choose what to order.  We had the truffle fries, pork rinds, seared Brussels sprouts, simple salad and seared endive salad.  Creative and delicious across the board.  Very friendly and helpful wait staff as well.  Good music in the background as well."
5 star rating,"Nice addition to downtown.  While the space and menu are rather small, they pull it off well.  Very flavorful food.  But beware- they follow the menu hours to the finest point: my son asked for a burger with an egg on top (it was lunch) and we were told that wasn't possible as all breakfast items were stopped being served.  Really, how hard was it to reach into a cooler and pull out an egg?  Duck Ruben was tasty."
4.5 star rating,"Came here for lunch and really enjoyed it!The space isn't huge but we came around 1pm on a Tuesday and it wasn't terribly crowded so we got a table right away. You can tell they do lunch for a lot of business folks in the area because they were on point with their service. Very fast and efficient. From our food coming out fast to our super attentive waiter. He was prompt but I didn't feel rushed. We were welcome to linger a bit after our plates had cleared and we paid our tab. But if we WERE in a hurry it would be great. Easy to get in and out in under an hour for sure. My girl Julia P got the mac & cheese while I, attempting to be a bit healthier lately, got the poached pear salad with grilled chicken. I stared at Julia's mac & cheese with sadness because it was everything I wanted (creamy, cheesy, carby) but then my salad was plated in front of me and I felt a lot better. It was great! Spinach, fennel, crunchy and spicy pepitas, creamy goat cheese, cornbread croutons, and a bacon vinaigrette. Lots of good textures and flavors all mixed together. Admittedly I didn't get a lot of bacon off the vinaigrette but it was still tasty. I was also glad they didn't drench the salad in dressing, it was just the right amount. The grilled chicken was the thicker half of a chicken breast, cooked perfectly (VERY juicy) and portioned just right. And for the record, I did have a bite of that mac & cheese and it was awesome. It made me a little jealous but not too much since my dish was so good.I thought for lunch the prices were pretty good (together our lunch was around twenty bucks) and the space is cool and convinenent when you're downtown. I'll definitely be back. Looking forward to trying it for brunch too!"
4 star rating,An excellent spot for lunch downtown! The beer & squash sandwich was great (don't miss the fries!). Definitely going back to try the Mac and cheese.
5 star rating,"We popped in for brunch on a Saturday and got lucky enough to get three seats @ the bar. Big Mike was awesome. The mimosas were awesome. My smoked salmon Benny, was also awesome. This is a cool spot and I'm happy to have experienced it on this trip back home.  Will be back for sure! My ONLY complaint would be the smokey smell. But that's a pet peeve I have. So if you don't mind smelling a little like a diner upon leaving... I'd say this place is well worth the trip!"

2 star rating,"Bland food. The veggie burger is a flavorless barley ball, ice cream scooped onto a bun. But on a Sunday, stuck on downtown Detroit, you may not have a choice. This town is forsaken."
1 star rating,"Duck Rueben is outstanding. My wife and I have been back several times, bringing new friends to enjoy this unique place.  We are picky when it comes to foodie sandwich shops and this place has yet to disappoint and we've had just about every sandwich and salad on the menu. We did breakfast once as well. They had a perfect take on eggs Benedict. Hidden gem! Just another glimpse into how Detroit is growing and attracting top notch food entrepreneurs."
5 star rating,"The joint is inside an office building. A small space for a party of 8 we waited about 45 minutes. As for food everything on the menu looked delicious. I got the duck bop hash which comes with two fried eggs, the flavoring and texture was awesome. Although i thought the duck tasted more like pork. The sausage hash looked amazing though with a huge piece of avocado on top. Service was on point we got our food reasonably quickly. Will def come back again but with less people. It looks like there is always a 20+ minute unless you are a party of 2."
4 star rating,"Came here for breakfast, to say I was disappointed is an understatement. We tried to order a salmon Benedict but they were out of it. Come to find out that was a blessing in disguise. A side of hollandaise was ordered with the avacodo, tomato, egg sandwich and it was cold and flavorless.Wait, did I say flavorless? That seemed to be the theme for the entire breakfast. My French toast was soggy and had zero taste. If I ate brioche covered in Elmer's paste it would have been no different than the hunk of paper maché that was dropped on my plate. If there was a plus to the morning it was the delicious coffee.  Won't be returning.D-"
1 star rating,"We came here for brunch on a Saturday and loved the atmosphere and food.  Glad to see more places like this opening in Detroit.  The service was a little spotty and we had a couple minor issues, but the staff was nice, acknowledged the mishaps, and made it up to us.  Definitely coming back here."
4.5 star rating,"A friend of mine and I decided to check this place out and were very excited to try their Korean fries. We waited bout 35 minutes to be seated on Sunday. Which wasn't bad. We had a very small table but it is a small place. Anyway so far so good, we got the Korean fries and wow so good I couldn't stop eating seriously. I got the breakfast burrito which was okay and my friend got the duck bop I think it was called and he said he liked it. Anywho, waitress wasn't very friendly I didn't see her smile once at us when she spoke to us or took our order. We ended up not giving her the best tip because we didn't feel she was friendly or care to give us a overview of the menu or what is popular despite telling her it was our first time. I get she was busy but it would have been nice. On our way out she went out of her way to walk around the restaurant and scream at us. How unprofessional is that? The place was packed and u went out of your way to treat new customers in such a unprofessional manner. Now we will never go there again and it's not because of the food it's because of her. I'm glad we never tipped her well because now we got to know what sort of person she really is."
3 star rating,Guys...Pork. Belly. Benny. Absolutely fantastic. Friendly and welcoming service and tasty coffee. So happy I stumbled across this place. Thank you for the best breakfast I've had in a long time. Can't wait to come back.
5 star rating,"If you're a fan of breakfast food, Dime Store is a must. It does fill up fast, so if you want to get there for lunch during the work week or brunch on the weekends, I recommend getting there early."
4 star rating,First time there based on Yelp ratings and was not disappointed.  Food was excellent. Arrived at 10:00 on Saturday morning and was seated right away.  Service was fast and friendly.  The homemade turkey sausage was the best I've had and the toast was done just right.  Two large slices of bread and not the lame thin slices that every other place serves.
5 star rating,Great staff. Friendly & attentive. Wide enough menu with their own take on the items. And having breakfast available all the time is a great touch. Comfortable even though there is a lot going on around you. I have been here several times now and it has made it to my list of regular rotation that I would gladly recommend to friends. Yum.
5 star rating,I feel guilty with this rating but it is based on a few things. Nice ambience but very loud. Very good service and interesting menu. I got mushroom hash thinking it would taste hearty with umami but not really. Too much potatoes and it did not meld into anything great. Special turkey pastrami was tasty. Will try again at a less busy time.
3 star rating,"I had the best avocado and tomato omelette with potato hash the other day. I'm still thinking about how good it was and can't wait to go back again. The chef and owner were incredibly helpful and accommodating in guiding me towards gluten free options. Excellent customer service, friendly atmosphere, cool decor and of course great food! You absolutely must go to The Dime Store."
5 star rating,The food was amazing. There is a wait so plan on that when going here. The food took a long time to get and we didn't see our server much. I had to take our bill to the counter so we could leave as our server didn't come back to get it.
4 star rating,"I've worked in the Chrysler House for over 2 years. I can't tell you enough how nice it was to finally get real food in the building. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. The food was amazing, I had the cheesesteak both time I have visited with fries. I can appreciate that they finally opened up phone orders. I would love to sit there and eat, but with my work schedule, time does not permit. A++++ all the way!!!"
5 star rating,Great food!!  Very inventive.  Wait staff was awesome!!!  Only downfall was the wait to get seated (50 minutes).  Looking forward to going back again!!
4.5 star rating,"Came to Dime Store for Sunday brunch with my boyfriend. We had no trouble with parking on the street for free, which was nice. We were welcomed very politely by the wait staff, and informed of a 20 minute wait which ended up only being about ten minutes. I loved the style of the restaurant! Very old school, trendy without being stuffy or having seats too close together. The owner did a nice job with the interior, it fit the consistency of a contemporary twist of ""the dime store."" We had incredible service, our waitress was friendly and outgoing, really added to the experience. She did not seem under stress, even though the place was packed. We order omelettes, and this is the only place where I felt was less than five stars. The food was okay, nothing above average, nothing below. I'm not exactly sure how to make an omelette seem outstanding, but maybe add sides to the meal that compliment better. We had a great time at the dime store, we will be back!"
4 star rating,Above average brunch food with a great atmosphere. My only knock is the size of restaurant is smaller which forces the tables to be extremely close to one another. Easily my favorite brunch spot in Downtown Detroit!
4 star rating,"Good food and pleasant place, very well located. A bit disappointed by the veggie burger but the rest (soup, duck burger) was excellent. Good spot for a lunch  in the middle of downtown."
4 star rating,"People of Detroit, go to this restaurant immediately! We visited from Chicago over Thanksgiving for the Bears/Lions game, yelp actually helped us find it, and thank god we went! I had the duck bop, and my boyfriend had the brioche french toast. So so sooooo good, nice Bloody Marys and a good selection of beers! We loved Detroit and will def be back!"

4 star rating,"We traveled to Detroit to visit family for the Fourth of July. We woke up late and famished so we looked for a brunch spot. Most of the other brunch spots were packed or closed so we landed here. We only waited 5-10 minutes to be seated. The place was cute but a little tight. Our waitress was great and very attentive. I had the sausage hash and subbed turkey sausage for the pork sausage. It was ok. It tasted like it needed seasoning and the breakfast potatoes tasted like they'd say out for a while, dried up and cardboard-like. Others at my table had the sausage hash, turkey sausage breakfast sandwich and Mac and cheese. We all had the same issue with the seasoning and the potatoes. There weren't even any salt or pepper shakers on the table. I think the star was the Mac and cheese that my son had. It had a delicious smoked flavor and was cheesy, hot and stringy, everything that you want in a good Mac and cheese!! I would have brought the potatoes to the waitress' attention however, like I said, we were hungry and didn't feel like waiting. If we're ever in the area again, we'll probably try them again in hopes that the seasoning and potatoes were just a fluke."
3 star rating,"Sorry but this place is overrated. Food was good but not great - and my friend's Mac and cheese was cold in the middle - which elicited a response of ""oh"" from the waiter. (Hint: ""I'm sorry"" is a better choice for next time)."
3 star rating,Came for lunch and had the Korean BBQ sandwhich.  It was super tasty but really small/light on meat.  I think they should stack it a little more for the price.
3 star rating,"Recently stayed downtown at the Book Cadillac and decided to have breakfast at the Dime Store. We visited one other time and were fortunate to have gone during happy hour. All drinks were 1/2 off. Wahoo. Ok back to the breakfast. We were seated right away even though they were crowded. Everything we ordered was great. We had orange juice which tasted like fresh squeezed, coffee, and omelettes. We loved the seasoning on the potatoes, very delicious. My husband also ordered a Dirty Blonde on draft. It was nice to see that on tap. Overall we had a great experience. The waitress was friendly and efficient.  We will be back and recommend to others."
5 star rating,"Well, it seems that everyone in this place is on amateur hour. Not too sure if the employees knew how to handle a busy Saturday brunch. Let's start with the host, he was the most unfriendly greeter I have ever met upon walking into a restaurant. When he would come out into the lobby you couldn't even hear him call your name. Second, we waited about 10 mins for a server to greet us and another 5 mins for drinks, the poor girl was struggling and getting triple sat and NOBODY was reaching out to help her. Another server came up to us to apologize that we were not in her section and that she would find our server. Ummmm, no? You can greet us and grab the drink order if you have enough time to go find the poor girl. Incredible, management needs to step in at times like that and notice when there are too long of guest wait times for DRINKS especially. However, the food came out promptly. My omelette was a solid cheesy goodness omelette but my potatoes and toast were cold and chewy as hell. Lame. After that, nobody came to check on us and meanwhile the table next to us was dealing with their burnt French toast and the server was handling it in the worst possible way. But, that wasn't my circus so whatever. The place looks cool, but make sure the rest of your staff follows along with your cool guidelines too. Otherwise, you all look like a buncha' rookies. Avoid this place unless it's on a Wednesday at like 2:30, maybe you won't get poor service and food then."
4.5 star rating,"This is a hopping, busy breakfast and brunch/lunch spot in downtown Detroit.  Good food, interesting combinations and twists on some of the usual fare.  Quality is very good and service is prompt...a bit aloof, but fine."
4 star rating,"Fantastic Breakfast, had the Veggie Hash and whilst I'm not a veggie it was delicious. My wife had the sausage hash too which she said was equally good. Can't wait to go back again."
5 star rating,"Be warned that there is almost always a wait, but it is worth it. My favorite two dishes are the duck bop hash and the Korean bbq. They have something for everyone and the food is creative. If you're a vegetarian the options are a bit slim. I tried the beet sandwich and found it a bit bland, saved by the goat cheese. That's the only dish I've tried that I wouldn't not recommend. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Perfect for a weekend brunch or a lunch break. It can get a bit loud at lunch, so if you are looking for a quiet place for a work lunch you might want to head somewhere else."
4 star rating,"great menu.  had the PBLT, and was delicious.  I work in the area, and will come back again and again"
4 star rating,"I probably could have gave them 5 stars, I have no complaints, I was seated pretty quickly, and had good service. I ordered the veggie hash and it was excellent. I'll def go back."
4 star rating,"Ate breakfast here after a Red Wings - Black Hawks game.  Interesting food...I had the Mario Benny and coffee, enjoyed both.  Enjoyed talking to the waiter.  Walking distance from Cobo and Joe Louis Arena."
4 star rating,I was overcharged for the premium vodka that I didn't ask for in my Bloody Mary.   Otherwise the food and service were good.  The food complaints are fairly minor. There was a big tendon piece in the duck hash that made the first bite unpleasant. Otherwise a delicious fusion dish. Too many red onions on the salmon eggs Benedict even for an onion lover.  The decor is cool and retro though the table did wobble a lot on the old concrete floor. Despite these negatives would go again.
3 star rating,"I was very impressed with this restaurant.  It's inside of a plaza, kind of small, but size doesn't matter to me.  I went with a group of friends on a Sunday afternoon at around 2 p.m.  Service was excellent, and the environment was pretty laid back.  I liked the mood / aesthetic of the place, it was lined with windows so great lighting and good choice of tables / chairs as well.  I ordered coffee, a mimosa and the veggie hash.  The coffee tasted great, and the mimosa was really good as well although I prefer my mimosa's to only have a splash of OJ - I received mine about half and half so it was a little bit weak.  The orange juice tasted so fresh I thought it was just squeezed but it wasn't.  Not sure what brand OJ they use but it was delicious.  In regards to my meal, I have nothing but good things to say.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly, and so were the veggies, drizzled with really yummy ranch and I had 2 eggs cooked over medium on top, and then a side of English muffin.  I was really impressed with the flavor profile, I didn't need any salt, pepper or hot sauce like I usually add.  I ate the entire meal.  Another good thing about this place is the food is super cheap.  My drink was kind of expensive though, but it balanced the bill.  I would definitely return here."
5 star rating,Terrific Place! Great addition to the already vibrant Detroit dining scene!
4 star rating,"Was looking forward to finally stopping in here and recommended it as a work lunch to my friends.  The spot is cute and comfortable, the food was fresh and tasted great... I would have had a nice experience if it wasn't for the fact that it took almost an hour to get our food for a party of 3. We were there a little after 1 when the lunch crowd was dying down and the 2 tables next to us came in after and almost finished eating before the waitress realized she didn't put our ticket in and then came and told us something happened with the ticket and it didn't print or some story and our food would be out next. I know stuff happens and I don't like to be a jerk so didn't say anything at the time, in retrospect at the least an I'm sorry for your wait or something, anything, would have made us feel better.  She didn't seem to care much honestly and an apology can go a long way.  I'd like to try more of the menu but just can't commit that much time to a lunch break because now I have to work late to make up the time. Maybe carry-out next time for me, that brussel sprout salad looked awesome, I wanted to eat if off my neighbors table while I was hungry and waiting."
4.5 star rating,This food looks pretty but absolutely taste like nothing! I didn't know it was possible to make sausage taste like paper. A little loving and seasoning could make this hipster breakfast spot stand out.
1 star rating,"My wife and I went for brunch here on Father's Day and it was extremely busy. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for a table, which didn't seem too bad because we were excited about the menu. When we were seated our waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink/app order. We each ordered a Bloody Mary and split a 1/2 order of Korean Fries and a side of the Mac N Cheese with Pork Belly. Drinks came quickly and were decent, but not exceptional. Shortly after our apps arrived. The Korean Fries were out of this world, I would put them in the must order category. The Mac N Cheese was kind of bland, it was helped along greatly with some salt and pepper (which we hardly ever use). No sooner did we finish up when our breakfasts arrived. I had the Duck Bop, which was outstanding. The potatoes were perfectly cooked as were the eggs. The duck confit was very flavorful.The pickled veggies and BBQ glaze gave it kind of a cool Bahn Mi feel. The wife ordered the Smoked Salmon Benny and we also split an order of the house made pork sausage. The Benny was the best thing I tasted in our visit. It was incredible. Perfectly portioned Salmon and the hollandaise was out of this world. I loved my dish, but I will certainly be ordering this next time we go. The pork sausage was kind of a disappointment. It tasted ok but was very dry. In fact, we had to ask our server if it wasn't turkey sausage. Oh well, it wasn't enough to sway my love for this place. They really do breakfast right."
4 star rating,"Good food, great setup, but they have a very rude hostess who is either too inexperienced or too lazy to handle busy mornings."
3 star rating,"Walked here for breakfast on Saturday from our hotel stay during a recent getaway with hubby.  Cute place, small, we sat at the bar with Big Mike, a cool guy who seemed to know everyone sitting at the bar. He made some good suggestions, poured a good bloody mary and chatted us up. Food was creative, and very good.  Glad to see the place full, downtown food scene is coming back. I would return if I was in the area."
4 star rating,"I work downtown and I went here for lunch.  The lunch menu would be great for omnivores; there aren't many choices for vegetarians (a beet-squash sandwich, the ubiquitous veggie burger, salads).  I ordered a beet salad that--according to the menu --was topped with figs; however, when the server brought the salad the figs were missing.  Turns out that figs are out of season and unavailable--disappointing but understandable, just UPDATE the menu!  The salad was fresh but unremarkable, and wasn't accompanied by bread of any sort, and I left the restaurant feeling hungry.  The decor is interesting (in a good way); unfortunately, the high ceilings mean it's pretty loud--conversation is difficult and you can't hear the music.  May try again in the future (breakfast looks promising), but I won't hurry back."
2 star rating,"We came here for brunch around 1130 during the Movement festival. We waited about 40 minutes for a two top. Overall, this was a great experience and I'd come back. The food was good (we both got breakfast sandwiches), the drinks were awesome (beermosa and bloody mary) and the atmosphere was cool. Our service was very slow and our server was not very attentive. Would still recommend."
4 star rating,"I got the pork belly sandwich, it got me incredibly sick. I couldn't hold down water. Strangely enough on the same night my buddy got a chicken sandwich and was too extremely sick the next day. I would love to say the food was good but having tasted it a second time 18 hours later I cannot. The beer is over priced. Go to Grand Trunk if you like this atmosphere, with a better beer selection, at a better price, that won't get you sick."
1 star rating,"I dined at the Dime Store restaurant today at lunch for the very first time. We had about a 15 minute wait for a table of four, but it was well worth it (we arrived at 12:30pm at peak downtown dining time).  We were conveniently able to pass the time by sitting at one of the roundtables in the building lobby.  I ordered the Poached Pear Salad and it was delicious!  I was still thinking about my lunch salad several hours later.  The hostess was right on cue, noting that a member of our party was on the plus side and she stealthily switched out one of the chairs for a more sturdy one without embarrassing or calling attention to anyone.  Our service was excellent too - a young woman with silver hair who was attentive, without being overly solicitous.  Two of my dining companions had the vegetarian hash dish and neither of them left a crumb on their plates!  The other ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries - and from across the table the fries looked really tempting.  The sandwich and fries were declared, ""yummy""!  Is unusual for four women to go out to lunch and leave without carry-out boxes containing the leftovers - but everything was fresh and tasty it was consumed on site!  We will be back soon,"
5 star rating,Went for lunch and the service was horrible with a mediocre sandwich. Not recommended and way too loud an atmosphere. Very underwhelming.
1 star rating,"My work colleagues and I tried out the Dime Store for lunch, which was delicious and an overall great experience.  My colleagues had the beef chili, pork belly sandwich and the beet salad - they really enjoyed everything.  I ordered the poached pear and spinach salad with added grilled chicken, which was also very good.  The menu is creative and has lots of good choices.  The difficult part of our visit was deciding what to have!  We will be back for another lunch - better to go early or late, as there is a considerable wait during the typical lunch hour.  One star deducted for service - our server disappeared after serving our food and only returned after we went to the front counter to request our bill.  When our server finally came back, she was apologetic, to her credit.  Also noticed a lot of wait staff standing around and chatting amongst themselves when there were noticeable things to do - busing tables, filling waters, etc.  Having waited a lot of tables in the past, I think this mostly reflects on the restaurant manager on duty at the time and their expectations - there are always lots of things to do at the front of the house and it is up to the manager to make sure the staff is well trained, staying busy and not just standing around (or disappearing) once the lunch rush is over.  Just my two cents."
