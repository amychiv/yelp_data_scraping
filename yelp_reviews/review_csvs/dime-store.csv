4.5 star rating,Long wait so grab a snack before. Totally worth the wait! The food was fresh and hearty. Thoroughly enjoyed myself! A few minutes walk from campus martius park.  Tomato soup 10/10 Healthy yummy options 10/10Service 10/10
5 star rating,"Always a wonderful time here.Kimchi fries are to die for. Be aware of a solid wait, but totally worth it"
5 star rating,This was a nice atmosphere and decent service. But the food was average.  We had the hash and the Steak Benny.   The food doesn't have a lot of seasoning and wasn't much better than going somewhere fast. We did like the drink that tastes like orange creamsicle.
3 star rating,"We're definitely going to have to give this one another try. We made the mistake of coming not that hungry - even after the hourlong wait to get a table. The space is small, and there's a large lobby where everyone waits to get a seat. It's kind of a mess, but the hosts try their best to make sure everyone is seated in the right order. Unfortunately, you can't join a waitlist online. You'll have to show up in person, and there's not a lot going on in the area. The food was delicious though. We had the duck fries, which were generously portioned. It's a good brunch spot if you can get past the wait, and I look forward to trying it out again."
4 star rating,"Quite the popular place for brunch here in downtown Detroit, especially on weekends. When I stopped by just before noon on a recent weekend, the quoted wait time for tables was up to 1 hour, although, mercifully, they had some space at the bar for singles, where the wait was a more reasonable 30 minutes.For brunch, you'll find all the usual dishes like benedicts, waffles, French toast, omelettes, sandwiches, and ""hash"" dishes, sometimes with slight twists on the ingredients. Some of the dishes like the ""spicy Korean fries"" and the duck bop hash that I had, which had ""Korean BBQ sauce,"" had some Asian touches, however small, to them. As for the duck bop hash, it was over all too quickly, featuring a very modest serving of duck and potatoes topped by two eggs.Still, this is all an upscale take on all the usual things you'd expect at brunch - all in an upbeat, lively, urban setting. Here's hoping that downtown Detroit continues to be reinvigorated with more venues like this!"
4 star rating,"We come here every year, it quickly became one of our fav brunch spots. Delish food and amazing service! This year I tried the duck bop hash and the spicy Korean fries, both were amazing! Will probably order that as my usual from now on. Not to mention their delish house made biscuits"
5 star rating,"The food was excellent, lots of good flavors as well as a large variety to choose from on the menu.  The prices were good for what you are getting and the wait staff is attentive and courteous.  Our server gave us great suggestions for our meals so don't be afraid to ask!  The ambience was okay.  It looks a little cuter online than the real deal, but other factors made up for that.  The tables are a bit too close together in my opinion for good conversation, but overall a good experience."
4 star rating,"Who doesn't love a great brunch!? There is something for everyone with a menu featuring locally sourced ingredients and housemade specialities that delight the pallet as well as the pocketbook. Seriously, the largest biscuits I have ever seen in a plate of biscuits and gravy. Great service plus Jasmine tea?! An instant classic for me. Plus the building is stunning."
4 star rating,"Love Dime Store, I just wish they did reservations or you could sign up on the wait list before you arrive. Generally the wait is more than 30 minutes but the food is worth it. They get you in and out and you still are able to enjoy your experience."
5 star rating,"In the word of unfilled restaurants, the Dime Store is going strong. I sat at the bar thus avoiding the waiting list.Great breakfast/lunch hangout in downtown Detroit. Other reviewers have raved about the breakfast and I can't add anything more. One of the specials was the corned beef omelet and I just had to try. The corned beef did not overpower the meal and it is filling. Just look at the pile of breakfast potatoes. Also, note the smaller cubes. Quicker even cooking means less brown bits.I could be a regular if I lived in Michigan."
4.5 star rating,"I was traveling from out of state to Detroit and wanted to try Dime Store after seeing it frequently recommended when researching brunch spots in the city. Glad I did, as this meal was phenomenal! Located inside the lobby of a polished financial district skyscraper, the restaurant had quite a few people in line to be seated, which is expected for a Saturday morning and worth the wait for the dining. The vibe once inside the eatery is modern and hip but cozy and bright, and service was prompt and friendly. The Eggs Benedict was perfectly poached and deliciously buttery and savory. I was surprised at the shining star of the dish, though - the salad, which was dressed in some sort of salty, tangy  vinaigrette that was incredibly unique, fresh and interesting and felt perfect for the brunch time of day. The Belgian Waffle was a nice dessert-like finisher- air fluffy soft and sweet. If I were a local, this spot would become a brunch favorite for sure. I'll definitely be back if I ever travel there again!"
5 star rating,Stopped in detroit on a layover and this brunch did not disappoint! My girlfriend and I got the BLTE and Korean BBQ fries and shared. It was the perfect amount for a midday meal. Really enjoyed the vibe of the place and the architecture of the building. Definitely recommend!
5 star rating,"Corned Beef BiscuitIt's a symphony in your mouth . Dime Store never disappoints!  They have an amazing breakfast sandwich in their specials list - a huge fluffy biscuit filled with corned beef, white cheddar, over hard egg & tangy buttered pickles with a grainy mustard mayo. A little sweet & tangy mixed with salty, buttery & creamy  This is one of the best savory sandwiches I've ever eaten. They get busy so go early (by/before 8:30)."
5 star rating,Definitely one of the best brunches I have ever had. The atmosphere was retro chic with upbeat music. The food was absolutely delicious. There was a 30 minute wait but they have a big waiting area and let you order coffee  while you wait.
5 star rating,Every dish arrived exactly as anticipated. Full of flavor! The peach cobbler French toast actually tasted like peach cobbler really good! Ingredients were all fresh. Price was worth it to me. I will definitely visit again
5 star rating,"My wife and I were on the hunt for the perfect brunch place in downtown Detroit. We were happy to stumble upon The Dime Store. First things first, I'm a coffee snob and the brew at this place can't be beat. I ordered the Dearborn bacon and avocado omelette.  Dime Store made a meal that could not have been more perfect for me!  It came with diced potatoes that were a little dry and room temp, but somehow still delicious!  I honestly ate every single bite. This place doesn't take reservations but if you have some time to spare you can walk around the city while waiting for your table. They will text or call you when your table is ready. It's a great way to spend a morning downtown!"
5 star rating,"Came here for weekend brunch! Overall it was a great and delicious experience. We got the lox salmon Benedict, and raspberry and candied ginger French toast. Only small suggestion would be changing up the home fries- as they were diced small they lacked flavor and texture compared to more largely cut home fries or hash browns. Definitely was more expensive of a brunch than other options around Detroit. Not insanely expensive but each dish was around $15ish. And be prepared to have a decent wait time on the weekends. They have it organized well with an automated system that shows your place in line, however as you are not able to add your name to the list ahead of time, you inevitably get stuck waiting for 30-45min even by 9am. Highly recommend just getting there early. Overall, was a lovely experience and glad to have this brunch option in downtown."
4 star rating,"The food and service here were excellent. However, it felt as if my girlfriend and I were on a double date with the couple next to us. If it weren't for the elbow-to-elbow seating arrangement, I would give the restaurant a 5 star rating."
4 star rating,"Top 5 Breakfast spots in the City of Detroit. This spot never misses to me. The Malted Belgian Waffle is amazing, flavorful and melts in your mouth. Veggie Omelette w/ Breakfast Potatoes is always good as well. Rare you find a House Made Turkey Breakfast Sausage Sandwich and let me tell you, it is amazing! The restaurant is small and not much of a looker, but the food makes up for it. Overall, great food. Simple."
4 star rating,"Can't wait to go back! I'll keep this simple... everything was delicious! Dime prides itself on everything being scratch made and it makes a difference. If you can get over the wait that's pretty typical every weekend lol, you will be in for a treat. Customer service was great from before we walked through the door. Kind, attentive, and the server was able to make some great recommendations.The food! Awwwww still drooling over that Malted Waffle with fresh fruit. Great texture. Not over sweet. Golden goodness. The buttermilk biscuit... I would literally come back just for 3 more of those. My friend order the chilaquiles benny and loved it, especially the homemade tortillas. She is from Texas and said they did not disappoint. Overall, can't wait to return and try some other goodies. I do wish they started offering more vegan or pescatarian options!! That would be amazing!"
4.5 star rating,"This place has the best biscuit I've ever had!!! Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday with brunch. They do not take reservations and this place is tiny so I suggest getting there early to snag a seat. I had the strawberry shortcake French toast with sausage patties and a biscuit on the side. I also had the Irish coffee but I subbed hot chocolate and omg it was divine but verrrrryyy strong! I did not care for the sausage patties, they had a weird taste to me. I think the seasoning may have been evoking southwest/Mexican flavor profiles but it just wasn't doing it for me. Tasted very off, not bad meat off but ""this seasoning is weird "" off. Now that biscuit....I don't care if you come here for a burger...get you a biscuit on the side! The thing is huge and they serve it with strawberry preserves which I believe are homemade. The whole combo was perfection. I was stuffed and didn't finish half of mine; it was so awesome that the next day I made a little breakfast sandwich with it and my leftover weird sausage and even that couldn't take away from the awesomeness!"
4 star rating,"Only person so i was able to go right in. Of course they were busy. This place is ALWAYS busy. This is maybe my 4th time here, 2nd time alone. Food is always good! My order came out about 20min after giving it. Mimosa & sangria weren't very strong but they aren't meant to be. Ask & you are given a voucher for parking in the financial district garage. Not sure of the length though."
4 star rating,"Wonderful experience at the dime store. Finally got a chance to visit after two unsuccessful attempts on weekends due to very long wait times. Definitely easier to get a spot during the week. Food was deliscious, staff was friendly and the service was quick :) definitely recommend it!"
5 star rating,"Great place for close and cozy breakfast, brunch and conversation. Small plates and great for morning dates. Moderate prices."
5 star rating,"If you don't have reservation be prepared to wait a while. Trust me, it's worth it. Dime Store does breakfast/brunch right. I've only been about three times (so far) but I have never been disappointed. Staff is great but the food is the star of the show. Can't wait to go back. Definitely eat here. Just make sure you have a reservation first to save yourself an hour plus. Or wait the hour, you'll be happy you did."
5 star rating,"We came to the motor city for the packers - lions game. Miss chose this place and we waited 45 minutes....ish and we considered going else where bc we wanted to get to Ford Field when it opened.  Boy, are we glad we waited ! The food, service, & atmosphere are worth the wait ! You won't be disappointed. Miss got the cheesesteak Benny & I got the grilled salmon sandwich with fruit. Wow !!  Just. Wow !!No, they don't take reservations, it is worth the wait. Cheers !"
5 star rating,"Dime Store is a popular breakfast diner in downtown Detroit. After having Sunday breakfast there, I can say it's solid food, but not life changing. Here's our experience:1) Atmosphere: It's a less divey dinner feel with a small seating area inside an office building. There's a mural on the wall of the icon on a dime and bar seating. 2) Food: It was good, but not out of this world. My eggs Benedict and a side of sausage were good, but nothing to come back for. Same with the waffle and my wife's omelet. Solid, but wouldn't run back.3) Service: It was GREAT! We got right in as a party of three around 9:30 a.m. on a Sunday and our server was fast and efficient."
3 star rating,"Such a great, energetic brunch spot with incredibly tasty dishes! The Korean duck hash was delicious and all the other food our party ordered looked amazing as well! We won't hesitate to come back next time we're in town!"
5 star rating,"Dime Store has been on my list of places to try in Detroit for quite some time. My friends and I finally decided to try it for brunch this past weekend. First and foremost, there is a long wait. We were estimated about 80 minutes but really waited 50 minutes(better than 80). When we were finally seated inside you could see how small the place was. It's more of a diner vibe which explains the long wait times. We were seated by the bar and could see all the cooks working hard to get the food out. The cooks are masked which was a bonus especially with new COVID variants coming out. Our waitress was very nice and took our orders very quickly. I ordered the French Toast with fruit which was delicious with a side of Dearborn ham.My friend ordered the sausage hash, which she said was delicious. The only con was that her food wasn't as hot as she was expecting. I also ordered the truffle fries to go and they were so good. Overall all it was a good experience and I'm glad we went. The food came out pretty fast despite how busy the place was."
4 star rating,"This is the place for brunch in Detroit. Coming from multiple sources as highly recommended, Dime Store did not disappoint. While we did have a slight wait, it was beyond worth it. The service, though packed when we went on a Friday morning, was friendly and fast. The coffee was excellent and no problem on the refills. I went with the duck leg hash and my partner went with the breakfast chilaquiles. The duck leg hash, in my opinion is quite possibly the best thing on the menu if you're into savory. There is no shortage of duck, and the glaze and sauce used is SO complex and delicious. I also loved the fry on the potato portion. The chilaquiles were no slouch either. Perfectly spicy and full of flavor! I would love to try a sweet dish here so I guess I'll have to come back next time I'm in Detroit!"
4.5 star rating,"I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant. It has great reviews and there is always a wait on the weekend. Arrived at about 930 am and was told there was an hour wait. We got our table at almost the one hour mark which was great. Our server was fast and efficient, but unfortunately the food was not great. We got biscuits and Gravy, the biscuit itself was delicious but the gravy had a weird flavor. There was also a clear liquid floating on the top of the gravy. For my meal I got the BLT egg sandwich and side salad. It was with lemon vinegarette which just tasted like lemon juice was squeezed on the lettuce. No seasoning or oils. The sandwich was bland and my friends Korean fries came out ice cold. Our waitress did get a replacement for those quite quickly which was nice. Overall I wanted to love this place but I won't be back."
2 star rating,"We stopped in for lunch while doing a holiday shopping wander downtown. I had the corn chowder (delish) and my husband had the chicken tortilla soup (this was more like chili made with chicken). My Bloody Mary was simple and delicious. The salmon sandwich warm, cooked perfectly and served with a generous serving of fresh fruit even though it past fruit season in Michigan. Our server was attentive, nice, welcoming and awesome! Thanks for a great meal and great service."
5 star rating,Stopped in here  for breakfast early on Saturday morning. It was a bit difficult to find as it was in the Chrysler house building. Upon arrival there was about 45 min wait however they got us seated in like 15. So that was great. All of our servers and workers were very friendly and helpful. Very small and quaint inside. But had some cool farmhouse/schoolhouse decor. I personally ordered the classic eggs Benedict. It was very solid. The hollandaise sauce was very good. They ham didn't have much flavor. Egg was good and biscuit was solid as well.  My wife order the peach French toast and she said it was just solid. She was on the fence on it. My oldest daughter got the bacon avocado omelet. She said it was very yummy and the bacon was thick and tasty. My other diabetes got a side of eggs and my second youngest got the waffles. I sampled her waffles and they may have been the best waffles I've ever tasted. Very soft and great flavor on the waffle and the syrup. Very good. Highly recommend that dish. Overall we had a good experience at this establishment. Some of the food was hit and miss. But the foods that we did like was phenomenal. Absolutely worth checking out if in the area and wanting a good breakfast.
4 star rating,"Slow service with an attitude, over priced and under portioned. Lackluster  breakfast."
2 star rating,"If you're looking for a well-seasoned, made from scratch, brunch option in downtown Detroit look no further than locally owned and operated, Dime Store. Nestled on the first floor of the Chrysler House DS is home to some of the most flavorful classic brunch options including the brisket benedict, Brussel sprouts & eggs as well as the peach Frech Toast. The service is phenomenal with only a light wait for food and drinks. I didn't notice any drink or brunch specials but, the Dime Store is thriving nonetheless. Went back and forth about whether this was a 4 or 5-star experience and ultimately landed on 4 because of the long wait (~80 mins for a table of 3)  and lack of wait listing/reservation process in place. With food this good the restaurant HAS to know there needs to be a better system for seating and bussing tables as well as reservations, especially since it's 2021 and this is Detroit. Pro Tip: They validate parking!"

4 star rating,"Oh my gosh Dime Store is the best brunch in Detroit! The menu is creative and flavorful, and the presentation finishes off the details for a perfect brunch. There is an array of Benedicts, waffles, French toast, hash for every palate. Grab a pitcher of mimosas to start your day off right! Make sure you prepare for a worth while wait if trying the Dime Store on the weekends. It's a tiny little gem!"
5 star rating,"3.5! I thought this menu had a lot of options, but I decided on lunch instead of brunch. The people I dined with really liked their brunch options and I liked the sandwich I got, but I don't really think it was anything crazy. It's in a good location though, so if you're hungry you should stop in if there's not too long if a wait!"
3 star rating,"If you get here before 9:45 am there's plenty of seating, any later and expect a wait... a wait that's worth it. They have two Chef specials this week that really need to become staples on their menu. I had their chicken Schwarma hash and my hubby had the pork belly and grits. Both were spot on and so flavorful. The schwarma had all the staple flavors you want and more and the pork belly was so savory and cooked perfectly. We both agreed that pur dishes were the best we've had around Detroit in a minute. Bartender was great, Bloody Mary was spot on. Great staff with great food."
5 star rating,The food n the atmosphere was amazing service was top notch the food was hot n on time even with the restaurant at full capacity
5 star rating,"Stopped in for brunch !  What a great experience.  You can't make reservations but it's worth the wait.  Hard to find parking but they do have parking garages in the area, a little pricey but if your going to walk around and shop Downtown then worth it.   Very classy chic place.  Upbeat and hip place.  The staff was very friendly.  We all ordered a brunch type of food.  Salads - fries eggs with salmon .  Everything was so good.  Very fresh and nice sized portions.  Definitely a great spot to go back to"
4.5 star rating,There aren't many true brunch spots in the city. so Dime Store is definitely a staple. They have good portions and all the brunch classics. They don't take reservations and are often very busy so plan to put your name down and wait around for a bit. There is street parking outside but they also have a parking lot where they validate.
5 star rating,one of the best brunch spots in detroit! dime store has a large menu of typical brunch fare with a unique twist. service is consistently good and parking is validated for the attached garage. the building dime store is in is historic and beautiful and ambience in the restaurant is laid back. definitely worth a trip!
4 star rating,"First time at Dime Store. As a breakfast, lunch, bunch place it's got an eclectic menu that straddles known comfort food and fresh ideas. I had the chicken shawarma hash. Breakfast potatoes, shawarma chicken, tomatoes, onion, eggs, yogurt sauce, cilantro, and pickles. Sounds like a really odd pairing but it was so right together. A take on a local favorite (shawarma). Sooo good. Check out this place if you are in Detroit."
5 star rating,"Unbelievably yummy! I've eaten brunch here a few times. Extremely tasty food. But the downsides are the very long wait (they don't take reservations, so you have to show up in person to put your name on the list) and sometimes the servers can get very, very busy. Don't be disappointed if you don't get a lot of special attention."
4 star rating,"If you get stuck waiting for a passport in downtown Detroit, spend your time wisely and enjoy lunch at The Dime Store!  Great style, friendly staff, and the food was fantastic!  I had the Cubabo sandwich and the Korean BBQ Fries which was more food than I needed for lunch!I have tried Cuban sandwiches other places and haven't been impressed but I would come back for this one!  Just perfectly done - lots of meat and the right balance of pickles and mustard. The side of fries can easily be a meal by themselves, but why not save half the sandwich for later and enjoy both!"
5 star rating,Ate brunch here on Sunday and it was too good! They don't accept reservations but the wait wasn't too bad. I ordered the Korean French fries and asked for a fried egg to be added. OMG it was so yummy!! The chicken sandwich and veggie hash was tasty too. Cocktails are always on point. Love this place!
5 star rating,This was a bit of waiting but the meal was well worth it (around 30 mins during peak). The chorizo omelet I had tasted amazing. The coffee was on pointe. Food came up quick once ordered. Just one tad bit is it can be somewhat cramped on the inside unless you're seating by the bar.
5 star rating,"This place is overrated. Food is mediocre. I had the cheese steak Benny which was not bad with the breakfast potatoes which were over cooked and just not good. I threw them away. My husband ordered the Sante Fe omelette which did not taste seasoned at all. I tried my sisters grits which were actually pretty good (and I'm picky about my grits). Overall, For this to be a black-owned establishment, I am very surprised at the lack of flavor."
3 star rating,The best  place for breakfast is now the best place for lunch!The soups were both great and the BLTE was awesome!
5 star rating,Atmosphere and space is interesting. Friendly and fast service. Cheesesteak benny is yummy and so are the house fries.
5 star rating,"Absolutely loved this restaurant. I was visiting Detroit for the NCAA wrestling tournament. The first morning a few of us went here and I had the best omelet I can ever remember having. Housemade sausage, fontina cheese, peppers, onions, and cooked to perfection. The next day some people wanted to eat at the hotel for convenience. OK, but what a let down after eating at Dime Store. So day three my wife and I avoided the group and came back to Dime Store. This time it was one of their hashes (also with the housemade sausage). When it came out I thought ""that is too much food, I won't be able to finish it"", but I sent back an empty plate in the end. It was too good to stop.The service was also topnotch. They were hustling and very friendly. At one point I was looking around for our waitress to get a coffee re-fill and one of the other waitresses noticed and asked if there was anything I needed. A little touch that goes a long way.A tiny place, but to me that is part of the charm. Almost felt like you are visiting a friend's place for breakfast."
4.5 star rating,"Great food.  Not boring menu selections lots of creative items.  Pricey and crowded and a bit slow at times, but worth the wait and the price."
5 star rating,"I love coming her for lunch! Great atmosphere, for food and service! I've gotten the b.l.t.e sandwich and chicken avocado salad - both were amazing! The Spicy Korean fries are terrific if you want to add some more flavor and fun to your meal!"
5 star rating,"I ordered the corned beef and hash with eggs.   Food was very tasty.   Coffee was so-so.  Server was great!   We Parked on the street in front of the building.  We paid $1.50 to park.  You need to get out of your car and go into the building, this cafe is in the corner, not visible from the street."
5 star rating,"This place was packed mid-morning on a Saturday, so we placed a to-go order and ate at Campus Martius. We got the cheesesteak benny and the housemade sausage hash, with a side of fresh fruit. We would definitely get it all again. This was probably the best breakfast/brunch we've had in our four months living in the area. If we lived closer, we would go all the time. But until then, it will be a destination for us whenever we're downtown!"
5 star rating,i love it there food is great and i love they kept it clean
5 star rating,"Delicious and great menu. Bennies were delicious, loved the fried green tomato, wish there was a smidge more pimento cheese, will request next time. Everything was really fresh, and I love that you can get choice of hash brown potatoes, side salad, or fruit on the side for the brunch stuff. Sometimes you want hash browns, sometimes you want truffle fries. Lots of brunch and lunch choices, salads or sandwiches."
5 star rating,"This place is small and the wait can be a tad long especially on a Sunday. It's definitely worth it. They do not take reservations so get there early. The menu has many options and adult drinks! We got the peach mimosa pitcher....it's was soooo good. The breakfast potatoes were the best, they were chopped up small and had lots of flavor. The staff was very busy but efficient and friendly."
5 star rating,"Usually when there's a 35 minute wait for a table at 1115a on a Monday in Downtown Detroit, that would indicate something special.  And when the wait is up to 90 minutes when you leave, something is probably truly legit. And it WAS.Super fresh ingredients, perfectly ripe avocado, great coffee and an impeccable food presentation. The housemade sausage is out of this world. Stellar Detroit breakfast."
5 star rating,"If i could start my day with dime store everyday... i would! i got the veggie hash and coffee and it was delish. The veggie hash was a great amount of food. i love breakfast foods so im always looks for a big plate and this filled me up. the flavors were amazing. this place is know for being busy with a long wait because it's smaller inside which i like. nice and cozy. i had two other people with me and we went on sunday at 8:30AM and there was no wait! don't expect to have the same experience at prime brunch time of 10 or 11, there was a long wait when we walked out. play your cards right and the dime store will definitely win you over."
5 star rating,"I recently revisited the Dime Store. This experience was by far better than the first. This was a very good experience from the service to the food! My family and I ordered food from the Brunch, Lunch, and Chef's Special menu selections. All of the options were well prepared and tasty. They also have very good coffee.  The energy is alway vibrant and expect to wait a minimum of 45 minutes, as tvis is, rightfully so, a popular spot. I'd definitely recommend for Breakfast, Brunch, or Lunch."
4.5 star rating,"Well worth the wait! A wonderful atmosphere with exceptional food and service! (Shoutout to Kelly for being amazing!) A small spot nestled in the Chrysler Building not to be missed by travelers. We were visiting from Indianapolis and got some of the most popular dishes; Cheesesteak Benny and fresh fruit for me and Duck Hash for my partner. The Benny was amazing, and trust me, I know a good Benny. But the real star of the show was the duck!Sweet juicy and perfectly tender, DO NOT MISS OUT!We also tried several beverages including iced and hot Irish coffee (hot won) as well as the Orange Creamsicle and freshly squeezed lemonade."
5 star rating,"The dime store is a good brunch place that's servers breakfast and lunch =brunch. (Lol)  this resturant normally have a long wait time. When I say long I'm talking about an hour long. So if you feel like waiting to eat go for it. Wish this location offered a service where I could just check in on my phone instead of checking in at the resturant. Now, when it comes to the food it's not bad prices range between ($10-$25) With a pitcher of mimosa costing about  $30 dollars.  Well I hope you enjoy your visit at the dime store."
4 star rating,Cold-smoked salmon Benny was amazing.Seated at the bar after 10-15 minutes during lunch on a busy weekday (April 2019). Our waitress was nice enough to tell us a little of the history even though they were busy (and it was crazy loud). Turns out the restaurant is located in an old dime bank where it used to cost 10 cents to open an account. There are still vaults downstairs.
5 star rating,"At first I was super excited to eat here. I waited a little over an hour. When we sat we ordered a few minutes after our server greeted us. However, we waited about a hour and more for our food. When the tables around us receive their food but came after us. We then were concerned and asked to speak to our waited that never came back to check in with us only to bring us a set of drinks. She checked on the tables around us but now with us. After everyone around us got their meals, we finally got our. My french toast came out first, it was cold to the touch. Then the bacon came out and it was cold to the touch and lastly the eggs came out and they were cold as well. Shortly after speaking to someone they brought me new french toast. That was also cold. On the third attempt she stated ""thats as hot as it will allow"". Which was a bit offensive because if I am paying for a service, at minimum the food should be hot or even warm. There should be no reason I have to check on my food several times to ensure it is done correctly. This was actually one of the worst experiences I have had in Detroit. As excited as I was, the over all experience with this establishment is subpar. The lack of customer service, empathy, kindness was appalling. Hope the next time I visit it can be a different experience!!!"
1 star rating,"Went back home to visit family and friends over the weekend and my friends raved about the Dime Store. I knew I had to check them out. This is a black-owned cute little brunch spot in the heart of downtown Detroit. I was so excited to see the variety on the menu and one of my favorite brunch items are eggs benedict. They had a lot of different eggs benedict options on their menu. My friend and I both ordered a different type of eggs benedict - my friend ordered the Cheesesteak Benedict and I ordered the chilaquiles eggs benedict. They both came with a side of fried potatoes. We also got some delicious French toast to share that was on the list of chef specials but I can't quite remember the name. I do remember that it had a delicious lemon curd and fresh raspberries. We really loved it. I'll certainly be visiting again when I come back home to Detroit! My friends and family let me know that their menu changes often and I love that about these quaint brunch places. The menu feels inspired by the seasons which is awesome. I will say though- The best thing about this place is the staff. Everyone we met, from the hostess to our waitress, was so very pleasant I made us smile and laugh. I can't say enough good things about this place!"
5 star rating,"Detroit is an interesting city -- culinary options are fairly limited. We wanted brunch and Dime Store had amazing reviews; figured we might as well try it. The wait was almost three hours--at this point, I'm thinking this place better be mind-blowing delicious. Their menu was basic, nothing imaginative. Food was passable for a diner. Drink options were limited. I'm glad I tried it so I can understand the hype. But, Detroit has to have better options right?"
2 star rating,We stopped in Dime Store while in Detroit. This place is a solid 5! We got there just in time for only an hour wait. The wait was up to two hours. The restaurant is a little small and capacity is still at about 50%. The Decor was cute and the staff extremely accommodating. There is also a full bar so of course we ordered a cocktail for Brunch. I opted out of the usual Mimosa and ordered a Lafayette Lemonade...can you say yum! It was delicious and refreshing. Now let's get to the food! OMG! We ordered the Lemon/Berry Brioche French Toast. It was delicious and flavorful. NOW if you love Sausage you HAVE GOT TO TRY the Homemade Sausage!! TO DIE FOR! I'm not a lover of sausage but this is hands down the best sausage I've ever had. We tried to purchase a couple of pounds to take home. LOL didn't work. After eating we totally understood the 2 hour wait.
5 star rating,"Excellent location, great diner! Poached eggs on the eggs Benedict were perfect! Sausage hash was super yummy. Loved the proximity to downtown sights."
5 star rating,"Great service, Kari was really nice, an great waitress!Love my Duck Pod, it was amazing lots of flavors. The remaining of our meal was normal. The wait was about 1.5 hours, worth trying."
4 star rating,"Amazing meal. Went with a friend and we had delicious peach mimosas and both had the hash. 10/10 would recommend. The following week we went back and had egg bennys and a waffle, also delicious. Chai tea latte was also very tasty and comforting. This place is really a good spot to hit in Detroit."
4.5 star rating,"I tried Dime Store this past weekend for the very first time for a brunch takeout & brought it back to the hotel we were getting ready at for a wedding. As we were placing the order, I was really excited about this menu! There seem to be so many great options that I was interested in trying that I'm eager to go back to try! Two of us got different kinds of their eggs benedict and I was very impressed that even with a takeout order, the poached eggs were still deliciously runny when we finally got to our hotel to eat them! My smoked salmon benny was DELICIOUS! I love a quality eggs benedict!My main complaints that with such a big order we place (food for 4 people), our takeout order came with 0 utensils! Dime Store, surely you don't expect that everyone (or even the majority of people) are taking this food to go directly home where they have a plethora of utensils at their disposal? We had to get really creative with how to eat our food, which hampered the experience a bit! My other complaint was that the fresh fruit side we had ordered was underwhelming - a lot of basic, cheap fruits like orange slices, grapes, apple slices, all not entirely ripe. I wouldn't recommend wasting money on getting this side."
4 star rating,This place was the BOMB! Best breakfast that we've had in forever! Service was amazing from the hostess all the way through. Thank you! Keep it up.
5 star rating,"According to Reviews.com, this is the best restaurant in our state. They go only by the number of reviews and the average rating. Well, here's another 5 star! We went on a weekday morning and didn't have to wait at all. Looking around and seeing how spaced out the tables are, between the bar spots and tables I counted about 20 seats total. So I can see how there could be a long wait on a weekend.It's in a historic building that was built between 1910 and 1912, and used to be called the Dime Building. That's just a little history lesson, which explains the cute name of the restaurant. It was easy to find based on another review here, that mentioned it was in the Chrysler House Building. We were able to get a metered parking spot, but there's also a parking garage nearby.The service was friendly, and the menu had some unique items. I finally decided on the homemade sausage hash. It was SO good! It said it came with spicy ketchup. The ketchup was actually drizzled on top, and I didn't find it very spicy (which is good for me). I had enough leftovers to take home a decent amount of hash, which I had the next day with a fried egg on top and some of my own drizzled ketchup to try to recreate what I had.My husband had a classic eggs benedict and said it was excellent. He knows good food, so I believe him!I'm so glad we tried this place. Great atmosphere and menu, really good food, and friendly service.  I'd definitely come back here."
5 star rating,"Definitely a classic brunch spot for me! It's never easy to get a table here unless you're willing to wait for at least 30 mins. But great food, lovely vibe and definitely the nicest view from here."
4 star rating,LOVED Dime Store!!  best veggie omelette and hash browns I have ever eaten!  Seriously. Waitstaff was amazing. Full house on a Monday 9:40a   Want to go back and try lunch!!  Don't miss.
5 star rating,"This place was amazing!! My husband and I were staying at the Westin hotel for my birthday, and we were looking for a nice place to get brunch. The food had amazing flavor, the biscuit had a hint of sweetness and tasted homemade absolutely delicious. The Cheesesteak Benny was perfectly done, the Korean fries had great flavor. I loved the vanilla chai latte. It was well worth the wait for sure. We ended up going back a second time! Highly recommend!"
5 star rating,The food here is divine. Everything was yummy and fresh. Make sure you go early and arrive on time because it gets filled up quickly and you can't be seated until your entire party arrives. Service was okay and professional.
5 star rating,"Everything was so good, even French fries tasted so yummy! This place was my first stop at Detroit and I'm glad, we had a good start for our trip"
5 star rating,"Just wow. Everything. So good. Great service, amazing food. The Duck bop was insane. The mimosas were strong and delicious. The wait was long, but you can go somewhere else while you wait. They text you when your table is ready."
5 star rating,"Busy place-- popped in for one and waited 20 minutes for a seat at the bar. Bustling, busy diner, but staff was available and service moved quickly with lots of coffee refills. Downtown Detroit with all of the office folks-- easiest for me to park in the garage a block away. Big breakfast portions -- not oily or salty (my biggest complaints about diners). Worth the wait!"
4.5 star rating,Good value. Food is adequate. Nothing special but hey. It's breakfast food.  Ambiance is nice. Will take others there if they like breakfast but personally just not my thing.
4 star rating,Amazing food everytime I go! Really enjoy my experience here the only negative is that it's so popular the wait time is usually an hour.
5 star rating,Long wait on weekends. 1 and 45 Min and more. Lemon blueberry pancakes were way too sweet. Me and my friend couldn't finish them. Eggs were bland and tasted like they cracked an egg shell in there. Potato Hash was too hard and crunchy to finish. Overall just ok.
1 star rating,"Outstanding!! The food was great, cooked perfectly with generous portions. Excellent service as well!!"
5 star rating,"I have walked by this restaurant at least a dozen times, on the first floor of the Chrysler building downtown. I have always noticed its busy, there is almost always a line of people...  So, it shouldnt have been a surprise that this hip diner is magnificent. However, we were pleasantly surprised.The staff here, showcases true teamwork. They seem to run this tiny space with fun and ease. Its a well oiled machine from the hostess, to the waitress to the guys and girls manning  the stove top/grill behind the bar. My latte was pure perfection, I even forgave the simple mug with their corporate logo. Eggs were perfectly poached, smothered in rich hollandaise sauce, good portion of duck and served with a refreshing side salad. My husband ordered a burger and was equally satisfied. We found a new brunch spot in Detroit and cant wait to come back to try one of their craft sandwiches.  Definitely worth 300 dimes for both of us!"
5 star rating,"After hearing all the hype of this restaurant, we visited for brunch one Saturday with friends and it definitely held up to my expectations. If you're going for brunch, expect a wait as this is a popular place to visit. However, as it is located inside the Chrysler House in Detroit you have indoor seating outside the restaurant to wait for your table and restrooms nearby. Once inside the Dime Store, the restaurant boasts a hip, quaint vibe. Staff was very friendly and pleasant conversation was had. Mimosas and Bloody Mary's are available for brunch, as well as delicious lattes in old-school diner style mugs. I ordered one of the Chef Specials--Strawberry Stuffed French Toast, which included chocolate ganache, whipped cream and strawberries. Delicious! Definitely a brunch spot to check out with a large variety of delicious lunch and breakfast options!"
4 star rating,You HAVE to get the duck bop. So so good. Full of flavor with a little kick. Christina H was also such a great server
5 star rating,"An office favorite. A destination everyone should have on their radar, even if you are traveling through Detroit for the day. This is THE daytime spot. This is the spot you recommend to your parents, your professor, the Aunt who has taste and the mother-in-law you want to impress... Rubbed shoulders with red wings players, dined across from some piston players, saw our local anchorman, and many more familiar faces that any Detroiter would recognize. Strictly a brunch/ lunch place. Ambiance is on point, and nestle in as this place is tight... literally small, so plan ahead if you are more than 4. I believe they do NOT take reservations. Hasn't been a dish I have not liked, but love the potatoes with the hash, which is a personal favorite. (Bring back the pork belly hash!!!!!) Duck bop is good too. Coffee is from zingermans... and if you know, you know...This is not a coney, so be prepared to spend $$ for their brunch/ lunch ~ 15-20 usually a person. Also don't expect to be sat right away if you come around noon... this place is hoping. Be prepared to share a four top with another two top in peak hours. Hint- if you like cheesesteaks order theirs and add truffle mayo (dollar more). I have to say... one of the best cheesesteaks in town.  Waitress recommended it just today and said it's one of the most ordered dishes. My only gripe about this place is the chairs... like nails on a chalkboard when someone tries to push them out or in. One of the most uncomfortable sounds imaginable and I clench my jaw just thinking about it. Please please please pad those up on the bottom."
5 star rating,"I've been wanting to come here for a while, but I could never seem to squeeze in a visit until now. I was down here on a random Saturday morning for a doctors appointment and took my chances and stopped in.Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised! I knew this place was good from the reviews, but I had to see it for myself. Walking in, you enter through a general lobby of a building, so there's plenty of seating and a large waiting area. Thank goodness, because the place was packed! I put my name in and was seated at the bar about 15 minutes later.I reviewed the menu and was unsure of what to get. I knew I wanted breakfast, but nothing really looked familiar. I chatted with the bartender, who was really super friendly despite this place being jammed to the gills. He recommended the Philly Cheesesteak eggs benedict, which I ended up going with.When the food came out, at first I was like, what? this is it? It just seemed small to me. But, I was starving and dug in. holy goodness, my eyes lied to me. This food was really really good. Between the cheese, runny eggs and steak, I was loving it! The food was awesome! The hash browns got better once I let them soak in the runny eggs, and threw on a little hot sauce.Overall, the food and service was fantastic. I am so thrilled I got the chance to finally eat here, as its been on my radar for some time.  The only downfalls are really minor. First, parking sucks here, so get ready to walk. Secondly, the place is tiny, so your going to sit really close to people. Aside from that, it's a great place to grab breakfast. I love eating downtown when I can, so it's always a treat for me, and this place rocks. Thank you dime store, you really are worth all the hype!"
4 star rating,Was looking for a new experience. Was looking on yelp for some help. I kept coming back to the reviews on Dime Store. Reading the story of the restaurant and listening to the reviews I couldn't wait to try it out. I dragged my husband for date brunch. We heard the Bloody Mary's and Korean Fries were awesome.When we asked up and asked what to order: Korean Fries. These did not disappoint. Can I say YUM! I wanted to lick the plate clean. We sat at the counter which you think not great. Best place to sit. The staff was amazing and funny. Guess what you get to see all the dishes come out which was super fun!Our Waiter Syd was great. We listened to the recommendations. Order the Korean Fries. It will not disappoint! I'm a Cheesesteak snob. That was amazing. The bread was soft and toasted the onions caramelized  and the meat was tender. Every bite was amazing and you just wanted to say mmmmmmm.....Korean Fries a must and Cheesesteak a must.Staff super friendly and loved it all. Can't wait to come back.
4.5 star rating,"A DIMEond in the rough, this one. Was in Detroit for work and had a bit of time to go out and score some brunch and dime store served us up a delicious combo of breakfast foods and goodness. Located in a lobby of a building it's somewhat hidden, but the old timey vibe and hipster element makes all feel welcome. We sat at the bar and saw how generously they poured the bloody Mary's // always a nice touch! I had the waffles with turkey sausage and my boyfriend had the duck hash. Both were top notch. The duck hash looked amazing and I immediately regretted my decision but I was feeling a sweet breakfast on that particular day. All in all - fun atmosphere and good food. Fun place to grab some brunch downtown Detroit."
4 star rating,"We've been wanting to try Dime Store for a while, but due to scheduling issues, we never seemed to make it there. Until now. And I'm so glad we finally made the time for it. We came on a Saturday at 1pm hoping to have missed the busiest time. We did not miss it. We waited almost 45 minutes, but didn't mind is too much, as Bon Bon Bon is Also locates just down the Hall. If you must wait, wait with chocolate. Anyways, we did get in and sat at the bar, right in front of the kitchen. Now normally I would be afraid of sitting right in front of the kitchen where they're preparing this much food for this many customers, but this kitchen was on point. I was so impressed by the focus and warp speed that everyone worked with. They were churning out an incredible amount of plates, and doing so with care and precision and teamwork. There was no yelling or panic. Just incredible team work. I was impressed. Next, the device was top level. Yes, the place was insanely crowded and packed with hungry people, but our server gave us his undivided attention and was helpful and never made us feel rushed. He gave great suggestions and was very friendly. The food. Oh the food. I expected the food to be good and e plain the hype, but man. This place knows how to do flavor. Both of us ordered brunch like dishes and were both thrilled with our choices. We devoured our food and neither one of us spoke the whole time we were eating other than ""oh my gosh this is so good. You're not getting any."" All in all, we were thrilled with Dime Store and can't wait to come back and visit again. I personally recommend trying one of their seasonal dishes, as that was a highlight for me."
5 star rating,"We had plans to check out Belle Isle on a Sunday afternoon, so I found the Dime Store on Yelp and decided we should go there. We arrived at about 10:30am and were quoted a 45 minute wait. We put down our names and sat down in the lobby to check out our other options. Nothing within walking distance really stood out (we had parked the car already) so we decided to stay and wait. It took about 45 minutes, give or take. We were seated and greeted by our waitress, who offered us drinks. We both already knew what we wanted, so ordering was a quick process. I had the Cold Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict and BF had the Pork Belly Eggs Benedict. Both were really good - and came with a nice side salad. I really enjoyed my EB. The smoked salmon was very flavorful and tasted fresh (or as fresh as smoked salmon can be). Our food arrived in a timely manner and the prices were very reasonable. It's not a quiet or romantic place to have brunch, but it is very delicious and quick."
5 star rating,"Delicious spot for brunch. I had their salmon eggs benedict - delicious. Though I recommend getting some sides along with your meal, it wasnt substantial enough for me. I left feeling hungry. I will be coming back for another look during lunch. Overall I can't find anything wrong other than the menu just seemed sparse."
4 star rating,"Service has gone down the drain here. Three tables who put their orders in after us got their orders before us. The table next to us even commented that they got their food before us but they were sat after us.  We had to keep prompting our server, some douche bag in a ponytail, if our order was even put in.  The manager, delivered our food and didn't even address why it took so long to get our food until asked. She chuckled and rolled her eyes when I said we'd like better service.  That attitude rolls down to inattentive staff.  No apologies were given at all. Taking this place off the rotation.Sorry you and your ""fryer"" went down but ONLY for our table."
1 star rating,"I went to Dime Store around the time it opened. They started with a really solid, reliable menu and it has changed little since that time. Brunch and lunch options abound, including a smoked salmon eggs benedict, breakfast sandwich, or, my favorite, the Korean beef sandwich with an elegant side of mixed greens.Atmosphere is noisy. Service is fast and friendly. Rather lengthy wait for brunch on the weekends!"
5 star rating,"This place is a diamond in the rough. My friend and I made an irresponsible decision to make a round trip drive from Atlanta to Detroit and back in one weekend. I have to say we were taken aback at the scene when we rolled up to downtown Detroit. It was quite desolate. Not much going on. But then we found the dime store, and our faith was restored for downtown Detroit. Although space is tight, and the wait was a little long, it was all worth it for the brunch experience. I was sad that I couldn't have a drink while waiting but something tells me that's a city law they have to follow. I would say the brunch is on par to what I am used to in Charleston (compliment). The ambiance and decor kept me busy while waiting for our meal. It's beautifully decorated. If I ever find myself back in downtown Detroit, I will definitely come back!"
5 star rating,"Soooo gooood. Sooooo smallllll. Sooooo bussssssy. Once we got in the door, service is quick and courteous. It's pretty cramped, so don't expect to have an intimate conversation, but you can expect opportunity to people watch and eavesdrop! I had a duck confit dish with pickled veg, and a nice jammy red sangria. It was absolutely perrrrrfect."
4 star rating,"Amazing food, service and atmosphere! I highly recommend the duck bop hash. The wait was around 25 minutes to be sat down but definitely worth it. Our drinks and food came out quickly once they were ordered. Would definitely come again."
5 star rating,"My second time at Dime Store and my impression hasn't changed: This is THE spot in downtown Detroit for excellent grub and delicious drinks! For those who love brunch any day of the week, THIS is your place and you will LOVE it!!This time, I brought a buddy. She called her oatmeal, ""The best f*#%ing oatmeal {I} ever had!"" And yes folks, it was that good (I was given a taste!!). For me, I indulged in the veggie hash. Wow. The fresh vegetables- baby carrots, zucchini, corn, and a bright heirloom tomato salad adorned a plate that included 2 fresh eggs on top of the crispiest little paprika dressed spuds. Let me not forget the English muffin that came with a fresh side of homemade apple butter. Oh myyyyy.Hope you get to Dime Store at some point. I will always be sure to visit when my travels take me back to Detroit.Thanks, Dime Store team-- you guys ROCK!!"
5 star rating,"Delicious foodie heaven!! I read the other reviews and they were right- this place has fresh, delicious food- you cant go wrong with anything on the menu! I went in for a ""light"" lunch on a late Tuesday afternoon- ordered a side dish portion of mac n cheese with broccoli-- trust me when i tell you this was a full meal-- delicious béchamel sauce well-covering the elbow pasta. Well-seasoned. Wasn't over ridden with broccoli so you can really enjoy the mac and cheese.Super friendly service, great location, beautiful industrial interior.When I come back to Detroit, I'll be visiting the Dime Store again!!"
4.5 star rating,"Best salmon salad I can remember in a long time. Salmon made with a maple glaze that's out of this world. Great staff, from the hostess, to the waitress and the cooks. Came on a Friday after the lunch crowd and got right in."
5 star rating,"I actually haven't been to Dime Store in over a year (a year, a week, and a day if you want to really count) bc I was over their bland/average food and long wait.  It actually felt like they had grown complacent and stopped caring about their food.  After a full year, I'm glad to report that Dime Store is off my ""do not eat"" list!! :DPros:- still loving the build your own omelette!! It's very filling- Coke products! I LOVE coke!- their bacon parm truffle fries are sooooooo yummy. ""It's 5 out of 5 stars!"" -my bf, who is well-trained in dating a Yelp elite girlCons:- breakfast potatoes are still frozen (I think. I've witnessed them throw frozen breakfast potatoes into the fryer multiple times), which can be a con if it really bothers you. It only bothered me when they didn't season them, but now they do!!- parking sucks- long wait on weekendsOverall, very glad I tried Dime Store again bc I can now continue to recommend it to others!!"
4 star rating,"Solid breakfast place!! It's right in the bottom of the Chrysler house with clearly visible signage. I made my own omelette with bell peppers, a little bit of cheese, and bacon. This came with some hash browns (they're actually some diced potatoes) and toast. The 2-egg omelette was fluffy and filling, the potatoes were delicious, but the toast and its jam were just okay. Not a biggie bc I'm not a fan of toast anyways. I also noticed my food is kinda salty, which I've found to be pretty consistent with everything else I've tried in the Midwest.My friend got some kind of Benedict, which came with a side salad, and she really liked both. She said the eggs were cooked to perfection!Great service, very attentive wait staff, and no issues wih wait time at all (everything came out in a timely manner). I'm glad to have discovered this place and can't wait to come back!"
4 star rating,"Great atmosphere, wonderful responsive staff, mediocre eats. I arrived for lunch to find the restaurant brimming with activity. Happy faces indicated this was their regular go to. I ordered an avocado omelette. The eggs were over cooked and cold, with the toast underdone and just 1/4 of an avocado. It was as though my dish was sitting back on the kitchen tarmac to time arrival. That creamy custardy center that is the signature of a perfect classic French omelette and the great flavor that comes with an Italian frittata (an Italian style omelette) both were missing. A local tangy feta sub for the dusting of cheddar might provide the magic needed for the timing to correct. The staff was incredibly positive and quick to try to fix things, so it was easy to fall in love with this spot."
3 star rating,"I really enjoyed brunch with two of my friends at Dime Store in Detroit. I got the Lox Eggs Benedict and the hashbrowns and it was heavenly. The menu is huge with lots of variety, and the atmosphere is adorable. We expected to wait for a while since we went on a weekend, but surprisingly got seated within 15 mins! It's crowded but as long as you don't mind getting friendly with your neighbor it's all good. The coffee was great too, and they offered a to-go cup. Great service."
5 star rating,"No joke, I have a major crush on this place. It's the best breakfast I have had EVER - and I promise you this is a very serious statement. We all know that breakfast is my thing, and we all know I'm a snob... how this place managed to top the list is this: amazing food, amazing staff, and amazing booze. Yep, that's what they did. Jerks.Food: I have dreams about eating the duck confit hash or reuben. I gaze off into the distance and imagine the pork belly bene hitting my palate. The truffle bene special (of course we had to add pork belly to that) was spectacular. So fresh, and truffles - yes please. And come ON with those brussel sprouts! I want those every day. Portions are perfect, I leave feeling full. If they were bigger, I'd leave feeling like I needed to vomit b/c there's no way I'd be able to stop myself from polishing off the plate. Really, you might see me in this restaurant licking the plate. I'm a little ashamed, yes - but a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.Staff: We had this waitress (Paige), she told us the best stuffs to order, she chatted us up, had a spectacular sense of humor. She even remembered the next time that we came in (a month later) that my friend had to go to his nephew's piano recital. She said to him, ""How was the recital?"" Really? That's a woman taking her job seriously - and rocking that job. I'm glad that I got to participate.Drinks: beermosa? Yes please. Delicious coffee, check. Add a little Bailey's? Sure, why not. Alcohol version of root beer and a cookie for dessert? Why the hell not?One thing to watch out for: the windows there get a nice blasting dose of sun in the AM and there aren't any shades. We sat at a table, were being blinded, and then the host gave us an attitude about wanting to change seats (easy, Detroit, with your new hipster attitude). They could fix that with a little shade action for the morning crowd - I mean, okay it's not sunny in Detroit all that often, but doing retinal damage over the weekend while trying to shove duck, pig, and beermosa down my gullet is not my idea of a good time."
5 star rating,This place was awesome! The food was delicious and even though we got it to go it was still fresh and enjoyable when it got to our hotel.
5 star rating,"Heard a lot of great things about the breakfast here. Since I came for lunch, I decided to get a Veggie Burger and fries. I was honestly disappointed in both. The veggie patty had literally no flavor. The fries also had no salt or seasoning. Was especially disappointed after seeing Michael Bolton loved his veggie burger here (eatdimestore.com/dime-st…).However, my friends really enjoyed their sandwiches and brunch dishes here, so this was probably just a bad first experience. They have the atmosphere down for sure. Nice ""instagrammable"" / ""foodie"" restaurant with a classy hipster vibe. You'd have to wait 45 minutes and pay 2-3x the price for something like this in New York or SF, so I can appreciate the accessibility to the community. I do envision this place getting busier and busier as more people move downtown, though. I might update this review the next time I go. Definitely give it a shot. Just do yourself a favor and don't get the veggie burger."
3 star rating,"Ok.. so I may receive flack for this but here goes.. Dimestore is SOOO worthy of a five star review. Why? Because the food is AMAZING... the service is STELLAR... the vibe is ON POINT.. and the location is THE BOMB; however, I am unable to rate this a five star at the present moment because of the following reasons: 1. During lunch hour a person can not be seated until all of the party is together. Huh?? Isn't that the point of being the first to be seated? TO SECURE SEATING INSTEAD OF WAITING?? 2. It is SUPER SMALL... the tables are smashed and I feel as though when a party is attempting to leave someone's big ass always bumps my drink, hand, or table.. not cool.. especially when manners are lacking! 3. I always leave smelling like I cooked the food myself. A mix between fast food joint and a smoking unkept stovetop with burning grease. Not cool when I have a super important meeting to attend afterwards.. The food is great, however, so if one is able to muster through my aforementioned nuances.. give them a try if you have not already :)"
4 star rating,"This is a great place for brunch.  I've been here twice and can't wait to return.  It can get crowded but we've been fortunate that we haven't had to wait for a table.  Like most good brunch spots I've been to, it's small and the tables are too close.  But hey I'm friendly so I can strike up a conversation with the neighboring table if need be.  Both times I've had the pork belly sandwich (pblt) and added smoked Gouda. This is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  Delicious!  We've also had the bacon, parm & truffle fries both times. I tried my friend's pork belly benny and breakfast potatoes and liked them as well.  I want to try other dishes here, but I can't let go of the pork belly sandwich and the bacon, parm, and truffle fries. Maybe I will venture out on my next visit."

4 star rating,"I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said. Hands down, best breakfast/brunch for me in Metro Detroit. And the lunch is just as delicious. I really like this place because it has fun with their brunch. You can get a standard breakfast...or you can get a chef's special that would include something like...say, a coney dog benedict. It's whimsical but not at the expense of quality. Their cooks/chefs have the chops to execute a delicious meal. My main quibble is the wait. Expect to wait for Sunday brunch. And wait some more. Are you still waiting? Yeah you are. We took spots at the bar because waiting for a table would guarantee an even longer wait time. The space is not in any way large. I felt quite claustrophobic. I do not know if it is their intention to move to a different space but I would be excited to hear if they are. I don't think that's enough to knock it down a star; the food is still very solid. Not that you'd be thinking about food after your meal, but Dime Store is in the same building as BonBonBon's downtown location and I would recommend stopping in either before or after your meal for some treats."
4.5 star rating,Had the duck bop. Hands down the best hash brown meal around. Highly recommend. May have a little bit of a kick with the Kimchi but I didn't notice it.
5 star rating,"It's like a fancy waffle house, but the flavor isn't quite there.Had high hopes with the ratings, and it really was only average. The menu sounds good, had a chef's special of lamb benedict. Not a lot of flavor, lukewarm, and overall just not great. My son had an omelet which was just a regular omelet, again not much too it. Wouldn't recommend."
3 star rating,"Great place! The menu was very exciting and Fresh. I really enjoyed the burrito. I was impressed how quickly the food came out, considering how busy they were. I'd come again for sure!"
5 star rating,Glad to have this addition downtown! A lot of the businesses in this area only cater to the 9-5 work crowd and serve breakfast and lunch only. Kudos to this new hot spot for staying open until 9p during the week and hosting brunch on Weekends. The servers are eager to make sure you are content. The food is beautifully plated and there is clearly an attention to detail when it comes to the flavor profile. I will be back again soon.
5 star rating,"Perfect. Came here on Thanksgiving and had, quite possibly, the best poached (hard) eggs of my life. Will definitely be back! Sure do wish they were open on Sunday. We need more solid Sunday brunch options in Detroit.Update:....and now they're open on Sunday! Went back my second time thinking, ""what are the odds they'll poach my eggs perfect again?"" - and they DID. This place is a gem."
5 star rating,Go early. If you go within the first hour or two you probably will get seated right away but wait much later and you'll be looking at least an hour wait.Food was good and service was wonderful. Would recommend to anyone looking to get brunch downtown.
4 star rating,"It must have been our lucky day because we had about a 2 minute wait on a Saturday around 11. We were seated at the bar. There is a great energy and feel to this place - it's got cool music and decor and was super busy.My guy ordered the smoked salmon benny. He really enjoyed it but was a little thrown off by the chilled salmon which made the eggs get cold quickly. I got the avocado and tomato breakfast sandwich. Simple but very fresh tasting. We split a side of potatoes which felt like a very bland after thought - no seasoning, dry, boring. All in all a great, energetic place!"
4 star rating,"In the past I would have rated Dime Store(DS)a 5+. Our work location is what initially lead us to the Dime Store and we enjoyed the food so much that on non-work days we would pile the family into the car and make the long drive in for a late breakfast/lunch. Hours of operation are from 8:00am-3:00pm. For no apparent reason our journeys to the DS have been less frequent. We typically order the same items at each visit: Bacon Parm Truffle Fries; Spicy Korean Fries; Various Omelets; Breakfast Sandwich;Special French Toast of the day and anything with the House-made Spicy Sausage for sure!! My fav used to be the hash potatoes served with breakfast. They were so good we can get side orders too! We kind of just put all the food in the middle of the table and have a family style type feast! Over the last 8 months or so the Hash Potatoes have evolved into nothing but their fries cut up into little squares prepared exactly like... the fries. Needless to say an order of fries are easier to eat than balancing these ""little hard dry nuggets"" on a fork. Honestly, these used to be so good they have  side orders on the menu. We are potatoes with our breakfast people. I tried smashing/cutting them but they kept flying off of my plate and even mixed with my eggs they flew off my fork! Just wasn't happening! Lol I have to say that you must try the different french fry options. The Spicy Korean Fries are the best!!! The sausage yummy too! Still worth trying. Just not the same"
3 star rating,This is our favorite place for breakfast.  The food is consistently delicious and the servers are always wonderful.
5 star rating,"awesome food, but get there early they are constantly busy.   Worth the wait."

5 star rating,"Great spot for breakfast and lunch. Lot of unique and classic menu items. If you're ever stuck between breakfast and lunch, here's a tip that sounds strange at first but you will not regret trying it. Get the Korean fries and ask to have an egg or two on top. It is delightful."
5 star rating,Amazing food and service. Tried the brussel sprout salad and it was surprisingly warm and really really delicious
5 star rating,"Great breakfast! We had a pretty quick wait in the spacious lobby area. Great latte and delicious Korean Fries as an ""appetizer."" I tried the cheesesteak Benedict and my date had the sausage hash with a biscuit instead of an English muffin. The biscuit was soooo delicious. Everything else was too but the fries, latte, and biscuit were the highlights!"
5 star rating,"Have been here 4-5 times now in the past few months - AMAZING! The food is SO good, I have ordered different things each time, all fantastic. My favorite is the sausage hash/scramble thing, which is mouth watering. Awesome service, quick but not pushy, and while I have waited an hour for a table before, there is coffee while you wait AND a super gorgeous lobby to wait in makes the time fly!"
5 star rating,"The Dime Store has a long wait for Sunday brunch and it is well worth it and the waiting area at the building lobby is beautiful.  It is a cozy environment, the staff is quick and very pleasant, and you can't go wrong with the selection.  They have a few specialty selections for the day which you can check out along with the rest of the menu in a beautiful waiting area."
5 star rating,Came here for brunch before a Tigers game and we were not disappointed. The sausage hash tasted so delicious. The toast and jam were amazing! The coffee tasted fresh with every pour and the Irish coffee is a must (so strong !) . Would definitely recommend coming here
4 star rating,"Amazing food! Amazing staff! So friendly and kind ! Went there with my dumb ass ex and he complained about the food because bland but I tasted it and it was fine.. he just liked his food even more salty I guess. I told him could just pour more salt on the eggs so he did.  I forgot to take home my order of Mac and cheese (so good.) and I called up and asked to come back and I had my receipt,.. and i was taken care of!"
5 star rating,"Excellent staff, the food was killer, get the pork rinds! Our first stop every time we are in Detroit"
5 star rating,Amazing brunch place! Good size place and busy but wait safe is on their game. Whether you are grabbing a quick coffee or getting grub You will not be disappointed!
4.5 star rating,We had lunch on St Patrick's day and only had to wait a few minutes for a table. We split the bullogi sandwich and poached pear salas. Both were excellent as was the service. Great prices too. Will be back.
5 star rating,"So good! We ended up here with crippling hangovers after a friends wedding. Big Mike at the bar greeted us with beermosas, recommendations, conversation and eventually pulled us from the depths. The food is fabulous- pork belly Benny, housemade sausage hash, mac and cheese...and everything that strolled out of the open kitchen looked equally amazing. Highly recommended."
5 star rating,"I've only ever gotten take out from here. I work nearby. Tried to order again today - an order for 8 people - was told today that they don't do to go orders for 6+ on weekends. Instead of calling back with two separate orders of 3 we'll be taking our business elsewhere. I called called with an order for the same group two days ago and had to talk to 4 different people before we were told that they ""maybe"" could do our order to call back in an hour. Then told they could, they'd call when it was ready, probably more than an hour. Twenty minutes later our food was ready. Terrible customer service over the phone. I've never found somewhere that does take out that's turning away orders. Very frustrating experiences. Even if they had the best food in the world their service would kill the experience. But the food wasn't even that good. Their philly cheesesteak wasok, but small sandwhich no sides for $10? I'd rather just got to which wich down the road, friendly service and fast. Very disappointed on what's supposed to be a delicious Detroit staple."
1 star rating,"We absolutely loved everything we ordered from here, the food was so good. We weren't as impressed with our drinks: Spanish coffee and mimosas, but the food was delicious and we plan on coming back soon!"
4 star rating,"Very nice young staff this place holds. Sometimes you worry when a restaurant has young people working but this is not one of them. The view is also great. It is technically a swamp but being able to see the sunset gave it a very homey touch. The food was excellently prepared, for me it was the Mahi Mahi sandwich. I also had their key lime pie for desert. It was excellently prepared and delivered. The pie itself was okay but not the best I had. That title is held by Mimi's cafe in California. Overall my #1 recommended restaurant in the area of Bonita Springs."
5 star rating,Stopped in for a quick breakfast. The food came fast and the service was great. It was fresh and reasonable in price. Great location with good atmosphere. I got the fresh sausage hash. Avocado looked great and got some extra sirracha with my meal. Got a cold brew with nitrogen. It was a neet trick but not really sure it justified the price. Tasted like any normal cold brew that was a little more frothy. Would go again.
4 star rating,"Always delicious! It can get really busy, but if you go in earlier you will not be disappointed!"
5 star rating,"While the wait was a little long and it's a small space, I'd go back. The one thing to get is the pork rinds. That's right. I'm not a fan of the packaged ones but my co-conspirator wanted to try them. Wow! I never thought I'd like pork rinds. Going back and will order these again. Oh yeah, the rest of the food was good too."
5 star rating,"AMAZING brunch! It was a bit of a wait for a table, but it was totally worth it!  Absolutely delicious drinks and food. Service was on point without being in your face.  Totally would return!"
5 star rating,Terrific brunch/lunch spot. Very crowded and vibrant loud bustle about the place. Sometimes a bit of a wait. Food is delicious and the staff are very attentive. The coffee is excellent! The omelette are fluffy and perfect.  Hips your own. Is perfect. We really liked this place.
