11/15/2021,5 star rating,Omg! The macaroni and cheese is fire! It's sooo good. I haven't had Mac that's was so good since my mother-in-law moved to Atlanta. I think this might challenge hers. Lol
10/30/2021,4 star rating,Got here around opening got fried porkchops with gravy on them and macncheese with greens.  Greens are good porkchop was great.  Cornbread and macncheese weren't the best.
8/4/2021,4 star rating,Super salad so full. The Mac and Cheese is like my grandma made it. The platter made me feel like that was after Sunday school at church. The elves with great however I don't like the outer edge but that's my personal preference. The cake was moist and tasteful and delicious. The chicken was fried perfectly however it could've used a little bit more seasoning. The catfish was so good. My husband said the black Eye peas use a little more seasoning. The platter they took extra long about 20 minutes. The lady at the window was kind of nice. The plexiglass separating the gas from the staff annoys me at all restaurants. If we are good enough to take your money we are good enough to stand in front of.
2/27/2021,4 star rating,Just a slow wait but besides would go back. Macaroni and cheese was oh my god amazing. Yams good everything was really good. I understand she was by herself working but everything looked n tasted delicious

11/3/2020,5 star rating,"I visited this location on Oct 10th, 2020.  The place was busy. But the staffkept us abreast as to when our order was coming it.  The very courteous,respectful and engaging.  I was visiting from Rochester NY and have many business in my plazas.  I admired their customer service and wanted to let them know they did a great job.  Being a Brotha with a sweet tooth I could not pass up those cakes.  I took a couple slices and they were slammin!!!  The next time I am in Detroit I will order a whole cake to bring back to Rochester, NY.  Keep up the good work."
10/18/2020,5 star rating,Great seasoning and reasonable prices. Their soul food tastes like that family member that can really cook.

9/18/2020,4 star rating,"Hubby brought home yummy delicious comfort foods tonight which was just what we needed after a long long did I say long week! We had pork chops, meat loaf catfish, Mac n cheese collard greens and yams. Everything was fresh and flavorful. My pork chop was a bit salty for my liking but not so much that it was bad. Mac n cheese and yams were my favorite. Each meal came with a large corn bread muffin. Called in the order and the food was ready when my hubby arrived after work to pick it up."
8/23/2020,5 star rating,First time trying this spot. Ordered through DoorDash. Besides the delivery being late this food was so good. My kids are picky eaters and they loved it also I will be returning. In person this time DoorDash upcharges are a lot. Macaroni was  super tasteful yams were perfect.
8/13/2020,3 star rating,"I decided to try Detroit Soul last weekend, as I had read a few reviews of the restaurant, and wanted to try a new Soulfood restaurant that was near me.  I was happy when I put the location in my GPS to see if was only 20 minutes away, straight show 8 Mile from where I live.I received an added bonus when I arrived, to see that the restaurant is right next to one of my favorite car detailing places.  So that was cool!  I immediately noticed going in that they had people going in and out ordering, and carrying their orders out, so I figured that was some type of sign to show the food is good.My turn off point was the service.  There were two young men (one taking the orders and handling the cash register, and one boxing the orders).  Neither one were overly pleasant or helpful.  But I decided to go ahead and place my order to check the food out despite (My biggest pet peeve is unprofessional staff and horrible service).Anyway, I ordered the Baked Chicken, Yams and Dressing.  After about 20 minutes, I received my food, and I did ask for a manager to provide my feedback of the actions of one of the young gentlemen working there.  The manager stated he would address the concern.  Overall, the food was good to me.  The Yams weren't as sweet as I like, but still good.  They Baked Chicken was seasoned good, and the Dressing was good.  I can't say the food was just over the top knocked my socks off good, but good enough that I would try the restaurant again.  Hopefully better service and less wait"
7/26/2020,1 star rating,This was the worst food I have ever received from there. Ordered the fried pork chop meal. The pork chops seem way overcooked or fried twice to be serve. Couldn't eat it was like having a plate of jerky
5/26/2020,5 star rating,I was greeted as I walked in which to me is a plus. The sides I ordered were very good. The Lemons and German Chocolate Cake was a plus. I will be back!!
5/21/2020,5 star rating,We're looking for something different for carryout so decided to give this place a shot after reading the great reviews. Tried the fried chicken which was juicy and flavorfully battered. Portion size was enough for two people in my opinion. For sides I got the macaroni and cheese which I highly recommend and the stuffing which I found to be on The salty side. I would recommend asking for extra gravy which would have helped make the dressing much better.
2/27/2020,5 star rating,Soul food with soul; fried foods are cooked to order.  Great & Professional Guest Services.  Pricing fair.  Portion size better than the rest.  I make a purchase at least once a week to avoid processed foods & to get a home cooked meal.  Access is non threatening.
10/19/2019,4 star rating,"Just visited this spot for the first time. Had a very delicious meal (mac & cheese, yams, dressing; husband had the 5 piece chicken wing dinner.) Will make it a regular stop when I am yearning for some good soul food. Customer service was excellent (could use some help as one person was taking orders in store and over the phone, as well as giving customers their orders when ready.)"

8/11/2019,4 star rating,"After my visit to Motown Museum, we had a taste for some soul food, particularly fried chicken and greens. We searched through Yelp and chose this restaurant. We went on a Wednesday around lunch time, not many patrons, so ordering was rather quick, once we decided what to eat. There was a lot to choose from. I selected the 5 piece chicken wings with greens, macaroni & cheese, and dressing (some may call it stuffing). The food was excellent, perfectly seasoned, good portions. The dressing was dry, but still good. I asked for extra gravy. It also came with cranberry sauce too. The meal came with a homemade muffin, which was good also. Give this restaurant a try, you won't be disappointed, in my opinion."
2/27/2016,3 star rating,"This restaurant is right down the street from me and with the great reviews, I had to give it a try.I'm not a fan of the parking lot. It doesn't make sense that you have to park at the car wash. I ordered the five piece wings. They were much smaller compared to every other soul food place, and they didn't have any kind of seasoning that I could taste. The macaroni was nothing more than noodles with melted cheese. They don't have mashed potatoes, which I just can't believe. But the have regular deep fried crinkle cut fries, which were in my opinion the best part of the meal. The cornbread was very dense and very cold. Would I suggest coming here? No. But I wouldn't turn it down if someone really wanted to come here. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. I would honestly take my money and head down to Ms. Evee's or Motor City Soul."
8/25/2016,5 star rating,":) All of the food is absolutely Devine :)Ive never had Cornbread Dressing and Fried Chicken this good at a takeout. Very clean and well kept establishment. Great people, that love people. You will not be disappointed."
7/21/2019,2 star rating,"Okay, my take on Motor City Soul is overall the food is good most of the time depending on who the cooks are for the day. But I have to reduce stars because they have horrible attitudes. Once I went there and ordered meatloaf and noticed they had given me an end piece which looked rather dry. I asked them to switch it and they refused, mind you I had not yet touched the plate it was still in their hands. I told them I have not yet paid so what if I just walk away what are you going to do with food then? My husband finally intervened and they agreed to add another piece of meatloaf, ok problem solved. Fast forward to today obviously the owner holds grudges because I placed my order speaking through the hole through the glass and she says lady you have a soft voice use your voice you use when you mad  Sad part she was serious. They really need to have some customer service training because their attitudes are Horrible beginning with that female owner. Next week I'm going to Barbara and Connie's where my dollar is appreciated."

Excellent, friendly service. Places like this I'd expect a wait, this is one of those meals I'd wait on. Best soul food I've had in the city."
8/2/2017,1 star rating,"I decided to stop by this spot because I was looking for some good food.  We arrived at 2:20pm and the lunch special ends at 3, the woman who was waiting on me told me she didn't have any ribs. They didn't have much, the pop was not cold. As the other reviews have mentioned the parking is terrible, the business is right next to a car wash that is very busy during the day. We left without even ordering. Poor customer service costed them 3 customers."
6/5/2018,5 star rating,"I eat here and its the best that I have had, and I was born in Louisiana. I was sitting at home craving greens and found much more. Satisfying my craving for a life long staple, there was the dressin. ""Who Mama dis is"". Making all these really great dishes. Porkchops, ribs, and then I got to the fried chicken. OMG.                                                                                                                                                                  I""ll be bacc"
5/22/2017,5 star rating,"Awesome place! Food is seasoned to perfections. I had the rib dinner and those ribs were fresh off the grill! U can't get that just anywhere most places use ovens. Staff are very friendly place is super clean. This taste just like home! Please visit I promise your taste buds will thank you. They are blowing motor city, ms. Evees everybody out the water! Parking not so great but I would walk 500 hundred miles to get back here! Detroit Soul keep up the good work and  thank u so much!"
7/6/2019,4 star rating,Absolutely the bomb! Definitely returning soon! Best stop made in Detroit July 2019! Highly recommend to everybody!
3/11/2017,5 star rating,Nice place. Good location on 8mile. Great team that's very friendly and welcoming too. I love the smell of smoking meat and the sight of the pits as you walk in. Tells you it's legit. I had the fried chicken which is on point and cooked fresh to order. Flavorful and moist. Crispy and fresh. You can't make it better. Collard greens excellent too. We are from out west just visiting and we found this place a great representative for the city and amazing food.
3/31/2019,5 star rating,Great food and customer service!!  Remembrance of southern living!! Location slightly East and close enough for West Side traveling.
6/23/2019,5 star rating,Catfish fried perfect. Wanted to go to sleep after I was full!! Can't wait to hit again!!
11/2/2016,5 star rating,"Okay, at first sight I was pleasantly pleased! The staff is very pleasant! The location was a little hard to find! But is was well worth the search! The food was great. I had smothered pork chops, yummy, with collards and cabbage!! My friend had fried chicken with mac-n-cheese and dressing!  We exchanged samples and we give are excited and pleased! The flavor was great, the portions were satisfying and the prices were comparable! Yummy and stuffed! We will be back!"
2/2/2018,1 star rating,"When I was younger this places used to be so good! Me along with about 7 others ordered a takeout and it was a hair in my gravy for my smothered chicken. And also no seasoning in the cabbage, even though it doesn't take much. Disappointed."

12/11/2015,5 star rating,I found this on this place on Yelp. Went for lunch.  This is a take out only place. Wife had the wings and I the catfish.  Wings were on the small side. This may have been for the lunch portion. Overall good portions and fair prices. Food and prep was quality. The place is small and may be a little hard to findbit worth the effort.
5/13/2018,5 star rating,"Finger lickin good!!! My family had the ribs, fried chicken, Mac and cheese, yams, dressing, and those greens baabee so good! We most definitely WILL go back."
3/30/2019,5 star rating,Came out to Detroit for The weekend from Los Angeles and was craving some soul food. Came across Detroit Soul and I cannot emphasize how lucky We were to find it. The food was delicious! We were greeted with the upmost respect and kindness they made sure we got everything we needed and even gave us 3 drinks on the house. Definitely must visit.
4/1/2019,5 star rating,"I came into town for a conference from California and wanted some try some Michigan soul food. I didn't expect to leave with my soul literally touched by some of the patrons and the workers there. A young man was cooking the meats out front. It smelled so good, I could hardly keep myself from jumping out of the car and running inside the place. Although my group did wait a while to get our orders, who I'm assuming to be the owner, he was extremely apologetic about it. The food was finger-licking good, portions were huge, and well worth the wait! We ordered fried fish, fried chicken, the pork ribs, the BBQ chicken, collard greens, baked beans, fries, the mac-n-cheese, and peach cobbler! I'm just going to say for those of you didn't like the mac-n-cheese...your tastebuds are broke so get 'em fixed! Peach cobbler was SWEET so if thats not your thing, be warned. But thank you to the kind gentlemen and lady from behind the counter who came out to give us words of support and the patron who chatted us up and all sent us on our way with our bellies and hearts full! If I'm ever back in Michigan, this is on my list of go-to places!"
1/19/2019,1 star rating,"ventured out in the snow for some comfort food. it was terrible! the macaroni & cheese is plain macaroni with a slice of melted american cheese on top. it tastes like the milk or eggs they used were sour. the cake had the same taste which leads me to believe it was bad dairy. the greens were good but the chicken was bone dry. for $20, all i ate was the greens. even the cornbread was dry! not worth the drive or the money"
10/19/2018,1 star rating,Very disappointed.  Sign and web says they open at 12:00 pulled up after 12:00 and they are not open nor answering the phone....... and it's Friday
2/10/2018,5 star rating,This is one of my favorite places to get soul food! They really have great customer service and the food is to die for!
6/13/2019,5 star rating,First time ordering here the food was delicious and the customer service was awesome I would definitely recommend the smothered pork chops
5/27/2019,5 star rating,Best food and best service in town! I've tried almost everything on the menu and is all good. We've even had a luncheon meeting here. Staff is friendly and courteous.  This is my go-to place to bring out-of-town guests.
3/1/2016,5 star rating,"The Smothered Pork Chops were amazing and tender, the yams were not too sweet and the Mac and cheese was Great!!!!! the food was so good, I had to try the dessert, the Red Velvet cake was so moist, the German chocolate and Lemon, I took with me but tasted them on my way to my next stops. By the time, I got home most of the other desserts were gone and nothing for others to really try so we had to make a return visit following the days to come. The staff was very friendly. I know, we as consumers always have choices and other places we can choose but this will always be my go to place. Its out of the way, but I will drive the extra distance to get the food as well as the service."
